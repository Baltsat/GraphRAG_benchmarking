Thoughts: Mahomed Akram

   If some day this body of mine were burned
   (It found no favour alas!with you)
   And the ashes scattered abroad, unurned,
   Would Love die also, would Thought die too?But who can answer, or who can trust,
       No dreams would harry the windblown dust?Were I laid away in the furrows deep
   Secure from jackal and passing plough,
   Would your eyes not follow me still through sleep
   Torment me then as they torture now?Would you ever have loved me, Golden Eyes,
       Had I done aught better or otherwise?Was I overspeechful, or did you yearn
   When I sat silent, for songs or speech?Ah, Beloved, I had been so apt to learn,
   So apt, had you only cared to teach.But time for silence and song is done,
       You wanted nothing, my Golden Sun!That drifts in its lonely orbit far
   Away from your soft, effulgent light
   In outer planes of Eternal night?Prayer

   You are all that is lovely and light,
     Aziza whom I adore,
   And, waking, after the night,
     I am weary with dreams of you.Every nerve in my heart is tense and sore
     As I rise to another morning apart from you.I dream of your luminous eyes,
     Aziza whom I adore!Of the ruffled silk of your hair,
   I dream, and the dreams are lies.But I love them, knowing no more
     Will ever be mine of you
   Aziza, my life's despair.I would burn for a thousand days,
   Aziza whom I adore,
   Be tortured, slain, in unheard of ways
     If you pitied the pain I bore.Your bright eyes, fastened on other things,
   Are keener to sting my soul, than scorpion stings!You are all that is lovely to me,
     All that is light,
   One white rose in a Desert of weariness.I only live in the night,
   The night, with its fair false dreams of you,
     You and your loveliness.Give me your love for a day,
             A night, an hour:
           If the wages of sin are Death
             I am willing to pay.What is my life but a breath
       Of passion burning away?O Aziza whom I adore,
     Aziza my one delight,
       Only one night, I will die before day,
     And trouble your life no more.The Aloe

   My life was like an Aloe flower, beneath an orient sky,
   Your sunshine touched it for an hour; it blossomed but to die.Torn up, cast out, on rubbish heaps where red flames work their will
   Each atom of the Aloe keeps the flower-time fragrance still.Memory

   How I loved you in your sleep,
   With the starlight on your hair!The touch of your lips was sweet,
     Aziza whom I adore,
   I lay at your slender feet,
     And against their soft palms pressed,
   I fitted my face to rest.As winds blow over the sea
     From Citron gardens ashore,
   Came, through your scented hair,
     The breeze of the night to me.My lips grew arid and dry,
     My nerves were tense,
   Though your beauty soothe the eye
     It maddens the sense.Every curve of that beauty is known to me,
   Every tint of that delicate roseleaf skin,
     And these are printed on every atom of me,
   Burnt in on every fibre until I die.And for this, my sin,
   I doubt if ever, though dust I be,
   The dust will lose the desire,
   The torment and hidden fire,
   Of my passionate love for you.Aziza whom I adore,
   My dust will be full of your beauty, as is the blue
   And infinite ocean full of the azure sky.In the light that waxed and waned
   Playing about your slumber in silver bars,
   As the palm trees swung their feathery fronds athwart the stars,
   How quiet and young you were,
   Pale as the Champa flowers, violet veined,
   That, sweet and fading, lay in your loosened hair.How sweet you were in your sleep,
   With the starlight on your hair!Your throat thrown backwards, bare,
   And touched with circling moonbeams, silver white
     On the couch's sombre shade.O Aziza my one delight,
   When Youth's passionate pulses fade,
   And his golden heart beats slow,
   When across the infinite sky
   I see the roseate glow
   Of my last, last sunset flare,
   I shall send my thoughts to this night
   And remember you as I die,
   The one thing, among all the things of this earth, found fair.How sweet you were in your sleep,
   With the starlight, silver and sable, across your hair!The First Lover

   As o'er the vessel's side she leant,
     She saw the swimmer in the sea
   With eager eyes on her intent,
     "Come down, come down and swim with me."So weary was she of her lot,
     Tired of the ship's monotony,
   She straightway all the world forgot
     Save the young swimmer in the sea

   So when the dusky, dying light
     Left all the water dark and dim,
   She softly, in the friendly night,
     Slipped down the vessel's side to him.Intent and brilliant, brightly dark,
     She saw his burning, eager eyes,
   And many a phosphorescent spark
     About his shoulders fall and rise.As through the hushed and Eastern night
     They swam together, hand in hand,
   Or lay and laughed in sheer delight
     Full length upon the level sand."Ah, soft, delusive, purple night
     Whose darkness knew no vexing moon!Ah, cruel, needless, dawning light
     That trembled in the sky too soon!"Khan Zada's Song on the Hillside

   The fires that burn on all the hills
     Light up the landscape grey,
   The arid desert land distills
     The fervours of the day.The clear white moon sails through the skies
     And silvers all the night,
   I see the brilliance of your eyes
     And need no other light.The death sighs of a thousand flowers
     The fervent day has slain
   Are wafted through the twilight hours,
     And perfume all the plain.My senses strain, and try to clasp
     Their sweetness in the air,
   In vain, in vain; they only grasp
     The fragrance of your hair.The plain is endless space expressed;
     Vast is the sky above,
   I only feel, against your breast,
     Infinities of love.Deserted Gipsy's Song: Hillside Camp

   She is glad to receive your turquoise ring,
         Dear and dark-eyed Lover of mine!I, to have given you everything:
         Beauty maddens the soul like Wine."She is proud to have held aloof her charms,
         Slender, dark-eyed Lover of mine!But I, of the night you lay in my arms:
         Beauty maddens the sense like Wine!"She triumphs to think that your heart is won,
         Stately, dark-eyed Lover of mine!I had not a thought of myself, not one:
         Beauty maddens the brain like Wine!"She will speak you softly, while skies are blue,
         Dear, deluded Lover of mine!I would lose both body and soul for you:
         Beauty maddens the brain like Wine!"While the ways are fair she will love you well,
         Dear, disdainful Lover of mine!But I would have followed you down to Hell:
         Beauty maddens the soul like Wine!"Though you lay at her feet the days to be,
         Now no longer Lover of mine!You can give her naught that you gave not me:
         Beauty maddened my soul like Wine!"When the years have shown what is false or true:
         Beauty maddens the sight like Wine!You will understand how I cared for you,
         First and only Lover of mine!"The Plains

               How one loves them
   These wide horizons; whether Desert or Sea,--
          Vague and vast and infinite; faintly clear--
   Surely, hid in the far away, unknown "There,"
          Lie the things so longed for and found not, found not, Here.Only where some passionate, level land
          Stretches itself in reaches of golden sand,
   Only where the sea line is joined to the sky-line, clear,
          Beyond the curve of ripple or white foamed crest,--
                         Shall the weary eyes
             Distressed by the broken skies,--
             Broken by Minaret, mountain, or towering tree,--
          Shall the weary eyes be assuaged,--be assuaged,--and rest."Lost Delight"

   After the Hazara War

   I lie alone beneath the Almond blossoms,
        Where we two lay together in the spring,
   And now, as then, the mountain snows are melting,
        This year, as last, the water-courses sing.That was another spring, and other flowers,
        Hung, pink and fragile, on the leafless tree,
   The land rejoiced in other running water,
        And I rejoiced, because you were with me.You, with your soft eyes, darkly lashed and shaded,
        Your red lips like a living, laughing rose,
   Your restless, amber limbs so lithe and slender
        Now lost to me.You lay beside me singing in the sunshine;
        The rough, white fur, unloosened at the neck,
   Showed the smooth skin, fair as the Almond blossoms,
        On which the sun could find no flaw or fleck.I lie alone, beneath the Almond flowers,
        I hated them to touch you as they fell.worse, Ah, worse, who loves you?(My soul is burning as men burn in Hell.)How I have sought you in the crowded cities!I have been mad, they say, for many days.I know not how I came here, to the valley,
        What fate has led me, through what doubtful ways.Somewhere I see my sword has done good service,
        Some one I killed, who, smiling, used your name,
   But in what country?Nay, I have forgotten,
        All thought is shrivelled in my heart's hot flame.Where are you now, Delight, and where your beauty,
        Your subtle curls, and laughing, changeful face?Bound, bruised and naked (dear God, grant me patience),
        And sold in Cabul in the market-place.Among so many captured, sold, or slain,
   What fate was yours?(Ah, dear God, grant me patience,
        My heart is burnt, is burnt, with fire and pain.)my heart is almost breaking,
        My sword is broken and my feet are sore,
   The people look at me and say in passing,
        "He will not leave the village any more."For as the evening falls, the fever rises,
        With frantic thoughts careering through the brain,
   Wild thoughts of you.(Ah, dear God, grant me patience,
        My soul is hurt beyond all men call pain.)I lie alone, beneath the Almond blossoms,
        And see the white snow melting on the hills
   Till Khorassan is gay with water-courses,
        Glad with the tinkling sound of running rills,

   And well I know that when the fragile petals
        Fall softly, ere the first green leaves appear,
   (Ah, for these last few days, God, grant me patience,)
        Since Delight is not, I shall not be, here!Unforgotten

   Do you ever think of me?you who died
       Ere our Youth's first fervour chilled,
   With your soft eyes and your pulses stilled
       Lying alone, aside,
   Do you ever think of me, left in the light,
   From the endless calm of your dawnless night?I am faithful always: I do not say
       That the lips which thrilled to your lips of old
   To lesser kisses are always cold;
       Had you wished for this in its narrow sense
       Our love perhaps had been less intense;
   But as we held faithfulness, you and I,
       I am faithful always, as you who lie,
       Asleep for ever, beneath the grass,
       While the days and nights and the seasons pass,--
           Pass away.I keep your memory near my heart,
       My brilliant, beautiful guiding Star,
   Till long live over, I too depart
       To the infinite night where perhaps you are.I would rather know you alive in Hell
   Than think your beauty is nothing now,
   With its deep dark eyes and tranquil brow
   Where the hair fell softly.Can this be true
   That nothing, nowhere, exists of you?Nothing, nowhere, oh, loved so well
       I have _never_ forgotten.Do you still keep
   Thoughts of me through your dreamless sleep?lost in Eternal Night,
       Lost Star of light,
   Risen splendidly, set so soon,
       Through the weariness of life's afternoon
             I dream of your memory yet.My loved and lost, whom I could not save,
   My youth went down with you to the grave,
   Though other planets and stars may rise,
   I dream of your soft and sorrowful eyes
           And I cannot forget.Song of Faiz Ulla

   Just at the time when Jasmins bloom, most sweetly in the summer weather,
   Lost in the scented Jungle gloom, one sultry night we spent together
   We, Love and Night, together blent, a Trinity of tranced content.Yet, while your lips were wholly mine, to kiss, to drink from, to caress,
   We heard some far-off faint distress; harsh drop of poison in sweet wine
   Lessening the fulness of delight,--
            Some quivering note of human pain,
   Which rose and fell and rose again, in plaintive sobs throughout the night,

   Spoiling the perfumed, moonless hours
   We spent among the Jasmin flowers.Story of Lilavanti

   They lay the slender body down
     With all its wealth of wetted hair,
   Only a daughter of the town,
     But very young and slight and fair.The eyes, whose light one cannot see,
     Are sombre doubtless, like the tresses,
   The mouth's soft curvings seem to be
     A roseate series of caresses.And where the skin has all but dried
     (The air is sultry in the room)
   Upon her breast and either side,
     It shows a soft and amber bloom.By women here, who knew her life,
     A leper husband, I am told,
   Took all this loveliness to wife
     When it was barely ten years old.And when the child in shocked dismay
     Fled from the hated husband's care
   He caught and tied her, so they say,
     Down to his bedside by her hair.To some low quarter of the town,
     Escaped a second time, she flew;
   Her beauty brought her great renown
     And many lovers here she knew,

   When, as the mystic Eastern night
     With purple shadow filled the air,
   Behind her window framed in light,
     She sat with jasmin in her hair.At last she loved a youth, who chose
     To keep this wild flower for his own,
   He in his garden set his rose
     Where it might bloom for him alone.Cholera came; her lover died,
     Want drove her to the streets again,
   And women found her there, who tried
     To turn her beauty into gain.But she who in those garden ways
     Had learnt of Love, would now no more
   Be bartered in the market place
     For silver, as in days before.That former life she strove to change;
     She sold the silver off her arms,
   While all the world grew cold and strange
     To broken health and fading charms.Till, finding lovers, but no friend,
     Nor any place to rest or hide,
   She grew despairing at the end,
     Slipped softly down a well and died.And yet, how short, when all is said,
     This little life of love and tears!Her age, they say, beside her bed,
     To-day is only fifteen years.The Garden by the Bridge

   The Desert sands are heated, parched and dreary,
     The tigers rend alive their quivering prey
   In the near Jungle; here the kites rise, weary,
     Too gorged with living food to fly away.All night the hungry jackals howl together
     Over the carrion in the river bed,
   Or seize some small soft thing of fur or feather
     Whose dying shrieks on the night air are shed.I hear from yonder Temple in the distance
     Whose roof with obscene carven Gods is piled,
   Reiterated with a sad insistence
     Sobs of, perhaps, some immolated child.Strange rites here, where the archway's shade is deeper,
     Are consummated in the river bed;
   Parias steal the rotten railway sleeper
     To burn the bodies of their cholera dead.But yet, their lust, their hunger, cannot shame them
     Goaded by fierce desire, that flays and stings;
   Poor beasts, and poorer men.Blame the Inherent Cruelty of Things.The world is horrible and I am lonely,
     Let me rest here where yellow roses bloom
   And find forgetfulness, remembering only
     Your face beside me in the scented gloom.I am not here for passion,
     I crave no love, only a little rest,
   Although I would my face lay, lover's fashion,
     Against the tender coolness of your breast.I am so weary of the Curse of Living
     The endless, aimless torture, tumult, fears.Surely, if life were any God's free giving,
     He, seeing His gift, long since went blind with tears.Seeing us; our fruitless strife, our futile praying,
     Our luckless Present and our bloodstained Past.Poor players, who make a trick or two in playing,
     But know that death _must_ win the game at last.As round the Fowler, red with feathered slaughter,
     The little joyous lark, unconscious, sings,--
   As the pink Lotus floats on azure water,
     Innocent of the mud from whence it springs.You walk through life, unheeding all the sorrow,
     The fear and pain set close around your way,
   Meeting with hopeful eyes each gay to-morrow,
     Living with joy each hour of glad to-day.I love to have you thus (nay, dear, lie quiet,
     How should these reverent fingers wrong your hair?)So calmly careless of the rush and riot
     That rages round is seething everywhere.You think your beauty
     Does but inflame my senses to desire,
   Till all you hold as loyalty and duty,
     Is shrunk and shrivelled in the ardent fire.You wrong me, wearied out with thought and grieving
     As though the whole world's sorrow eat my heart,
   I come to gaze upon your face believing
     Its beauty is as ointment to the smart.Lie still and let me in my desolation
     Caress the soft loose hair a moment's span.Since Loveliness is Life's one Consolation,
     And love the only Lethe left to man.Ah, give me here beneath the trees in flower,
     Beside the river where the fireflies pass,
   One little dusky, all consoling hour
     Lost in the shadow of the long grown grass

   Give me, oh you whose arms are soft and slender,
     Whose eyes are nothing but one long caress,
   Against your heart, so innocent and tender,
     A little Love and some Forgetfulness.Fate Knows no Tears

   Just as the dawn of Love was breaking
          Across the weary world of grey,
   Just as my life once more was waking
          As roses waken late in May,
   Fate, blindly cruel and havoc-making,
          Stepped in and carried you away.Memories have I none in keeping
          Of times I held you near my heart,
   Of dreams when we were near to weeping
          That dawn should bid us rise and part;
   Never, alas, I saw you sleeping
          With soft closed eyes and lips apart,

   Breathing my name still through your dreaming.--
          Ah!But Fate, unheeding human scheming,
          Serenely reckless came between--
   Fate with her cold eyes hard and gleaming
          Unseared by all the sorrow seen.well-beloved, I never told you,
          I did not show in speech or song,
   How at the end I longed to fold you
          Close in my arms; so fierce and strong
   The longing grew to have and hold you,
          You, and you only, all life long.They who know nothing call me fickle,
          Keen to pursue and loth to keep.Ah, could they see these tears that trickle
          From eyes erstwhile too proud to weep.Could see me, prone, beneath the sickle,
          While pain and sorrow stand and reap!Unopened scarce, yet overblown, lie
          The hopes that rose-like round me grew,
   The lights are low, and more than lonely
          This life I lead apart from you.I want you only,
          And you who loved me never knew.You loved me, pleaded for compassion
          On all the pain I would not share;
   And I in weary, halting fashion
          Was loth to listen, long to care;
   But now, dear God!I faint with passion
          For your far eyes and distant hair.Yes, I am faint with love, and broken
          With sleepless nights and empty days;
   I want your soft words fiercely spoken,
          Your tender looks and wayward ways--
   Want that strange smile that gave me token
          Of many things that no man says.Cold was I, weary, slow to waken
          Till, startled by your ardent eyes,
   I felt the soul within me shaken
          And long-forgotten senses rise;
   But in that moment you were taken,
          And thus we lost our Paradise!Farewell, we may not now recover
          That golden "Then" misspent, passed by,
   We shall not meet as loved and lover
          Here, or hereafter, you and I.
   My time for loving you is over,
          Love has no future, but to die.And thus we part, with no believing
          In any chance of future years.We have no idle self-deceiving,
          No half-consoling hopes and fears;
   We know the Gods grant no retrieving
          A wasted chance.Verses: Faiz Ulla

   Just in the hush before dawn
   A little wistful wind is born.A little chilly errant breeze,
   That thrills the grasses, stirs the trees.And, as it wanders on its way,
   While yet the night is cool and dark,
   The first carol of the lark,--
   Its plaintive murmurs seem to say
   "I wait the sorrows of the day."Two Songs by Sitara, of Kashmir

   Beloved!your hair was golden
   As tender tints of sunrise,
   As corn beside the River
         In softly varying hues.I loved you for your slightness,
   Your melancholy sweetness,
   Your changeful eyes, that promised
         What your lips would still refuse.You came to me, and loved me,
   Were mine upon the River,
   The azure water saw us
         And the blue transparent sky;
   The Lotus flowers knew it,
   Our happiness together,
   While life was only River,
         Only love, and you and I.

   Love wakened on the River,
   To sounds of running water,
   With silver Stars for witness
         And reflected Stars for light;
   Awakened to existence,
   With ripples for first music
   And sunlight on the River
         For earliest sense of sight.Love grew upon the River
   Among the scented flowers,
   The open rosy flowers
         Of the Lotus buds in bloom--
   Love, brilliant as the Morning,
   More fervent than the Noon-day,
   And tender as the Twilight
         In its blue transparent gloom.Cold snow upon the mountains,
   The Lotus leaves turned yellow
         And the water very grey.Our kisses faint and falter,
   The clinging hands unfasten,
   The golden time is over
         And our passion dies away.To be forgotten,
           A ripple on the River,
           That flashes in the sunset,
           That flashed,--and died away.Second Song: The Girl from Baltistan

                            Throb, throb, throb,
   Far away in the blue transparent Night,
   On the outer horizon of a dreaming consciousness,
   She hears the sound of her lover's nearing boat
               Afar, afloat
   On the river's loneliness, where the Stars are the only light;
      Hear the sound of the straining wood
          Like a broken sob
          Of a heart's distress,
      Loving misunderstood.She lies, with her loose hair spent in soft disorder,
   On a silken sheet with a purple woven border,
   Every cell of her brain is latent fire,
   Every fibre tense with restrained desire.And the straining oars sound clearer, clearer,
          The boat is approaching nearer, nearer;
        "How to wait through the moments' space
        Till I see the light of my lover's face?"Throb, throb, throb,
   The sound dies down the stream
   Till it only clings at the senses' edge
   Like a half-remembered dream.Doubtless, he in the silence lies,
         His fair face turned to the tender skies,
         Starlight touching his sleeping eyes.While his boat caught in the thickset sedge
   And the waters round it gurgle and sob,
         Or floats set free on the river's tide,
                                  Oars laid aside.She is awake and knows no rest,
   Passion dies and is dispossessed
          Of his brief, despotic power.But the Brain, once kindled, would still be afire
   Were the whole world pasture to its desire,
   And all of love, in a single hour,--
   A single wine cup, filled to the brim,
                              Given to slake its thirst.Some there are who are thus-wise cursed
         Times that follow fulfilled desire
         Are of all their hours the worst.They find no Respite and reach no Rest,
   Though passion fail and desire grow dim,
         No assuagement comes from the thing possessed
                      For possession feeds the fire."Oh, for the life of the bright hued things
          Whose marriage and death are one,
        A floating fusion on golden wings."But we who re-marry a thousand times,
          As the spirit or senses will,
        In a thousand ways, in a thousand climes,
          We remain unsatisfied still."As her lover left her, alone, awake she lies,
   With a sleepless brain and weary, half-closed eyes.She turns her face where the purple silk is spread,
   Still sweet with delicate perfume his presence shed.Her arms remembered his vanished beauty still,
   And, reminiscent of clustered curls, her fingers thrill.While the wonderful, Starlit Night wears slowly on
   Till the light of another day, serene and wan,
                              Pierces the eastern skies.Palm Trees by the Sea

   Love, let me thank you for this!Now we have drifted apart,
   Wandered away from the sea,--
     For the fresh touch of your kiss,
   For the young warmth of your heart,
     For your youth given to me.Thanks: for the curls of your hair,
     Softer than silk to the hand,
   For the clear gaze of your eyes.For yourself: delicate, fair,
   Seen as you lay on the sand,
     Under the violet skies.Thanks: for the words that you said,--
     Secretly, tenderly sweet,
   All through the tropical day,
     Till, when the sunset was red,
   I, who lay still at your feet,
     Felt my life ebbing away,

   Weary and worn with desire,
     Only yourself could console.For that fierce fervour and fire
   Burnt through my lips to my soul
     From the white heat of your kiss!You were the essence of Spring,
     Wayward and bright as a flame:
   Though we have drifted apart,
     Still how the syllables sing
   Mixed in your musical name,
     Deep in the well of my heart!Once in the lingering light,
     Thrown from the west on the Sea,
   Laid you your garments aside,
     Slender and goldenly bright,
   Glimmered your beauty, set free,
     Bright as a pearl in the tide.Once, ere the thrill of the dawn
     Silvered the edge of the sea,
   I, who lay watching you rest,--
     Pale in the chill of the morn
   Found you still dreaming of me
     Stilled by love's fancies possessed.Fallen on sorrowful days,
     Love, let me thank you for this,
   You were so happy with me!Wrapped in Youth's roseate haze,
   Wanting no more than my kiss
     By the blue edge of the sea!Ah, for those nights on the sand
     Under the palms by the sea,
   For the strange dream of those days
     Spent in the passionate land,
   For your youth given to me,
     I am your debtor always!Song by Gulbaz

   "Is it safe to lie so lonely when the summer twilight closes
   No companion maidens, only you asleep among the roses?"Thirteen, fourteen years you number, and your hair is soft and scented,
   Perilous is such a slumber in the twilight all untented."Lonely loveliness means danger, lying in your rose-leaf nest,
   What if some young passing stranger broke into your careless rest?"But she would not heed the warning, lay alone serene and slight,
   Till the rosy spears of morning slew the darkness of the night.Young love, walking softly, found her, in the scented, shady closes,
   Threw his ardent arms around her, kissed her lips beneath the roses.And she said, with smiles and blushes, "Would that I had sooner known!Never now the morning thrushes wake and find me all alone."Since you said the rose-leaf cover sweet protection gave, but slight,
   I have found this dear young lover to protect me through the night!"Kashmiri Song

   Pale hands I love beside the Shalimar,
     Where are you now?Whom do you lead on Rapture's roadway, far,
     Before you agonise them in farewell?Oh, pale dispensers of my Joys and Pains,
     Holding the doors of Heaven and of Hell,
   How the hot blood rushed wildly through the veins
     Beneath your touch, until you waved farewell.Pale hands, pink tipped, like Lotus buds that float
     On those cool waters where we used to dwell,
   I would have rather felt you round my throat,
     Crushing out life, than waving me farewell!Reverie of Ormuz the Persian

   Softly the feathery Palm-trees fade in the violet Distance,
   Faintly the lingering light touches the edge of the sea,
   Sadly the Music of Waves, drifts, faint as an Anthem's insistence,
   Heard in the aisles of a dream, over the sandhills, to me.Now that the Lights are reversed, and the Singing changed into sighing,
   Now that the wings of our fierce, fugitive passion are furled,
   Take I unto myself, all alone in the light that is dying,
   Much of the sorrow that lies hid at the Heart of the World.Sad am I, sad for your loss: for failing the charm of your presence,
   Even the sunshine has paled, leaving the Zenith less blue.Even the ocean lessens the light of its green opalescence,
   Since, to my sorrow I loved, loved and grew weary of, you.Why was our passion so fleeting, why had the flush of your beauty
   Only so slender a spell, only so futile a power?Yet, even thus ever is life, save when long custom or duty
   Moulds into sober fruit Love's fragile and fugitive flower.Fain would my soul have been faithful; never an alien pleasure
   Lured me away from the light lit in your luminous eyes,
   But we have altered the World as pitiful man has leisure
   To criticise, balance, take counsel, assuredly lies.All through the centuries Man has gathered his flower, and fenced it,
   --Infinite strife to attain; infinite struggle to keep,--
   Holding his treasure awhile, all Fate and all forces against it,
   Knowing it his no more, if ever his vigilance sleep.But we have altered the World as pitiful man has grown stronger,
   So that the things we love are as easily kept as won,
   Therefore the ancient fight can engage and detain us no longer,
   And all too swiftly, alas, passion is over and done.Far too speedily now we can gather the coveted treasure,
   Enjoy it awhile, be satiated, begin to tire;
   And what shall be done henceforth with the profitless after-leisure,
   Who has the breath to kindle the ash of a faded fire?After my ardent endeavour
   Came the delirious Joy, flooding my life like a sea,
   Days of delight that are burnt on the brain for ever and ever,
   Days and nights when you loved, before you grew weary of me.Softly the sunset decreases dim in the violet Distance,
   Even as Love's own fervour has faded away from me,
   Leaving the weariness, the monotonous Weight of Existence,--
   All the farewells in the world weep in the sound of the sea.Sunstroke

   Oh, straight, white road that runs to meet,
            Across green fields, the blue green sea,
   You knew the little weary feet
            Of my child bride that was to be!Her people brought her from the shore
            One golden day in sultry June,
   And I stood, waiting, at the door,
            Praying my eyes might see her soon.With eager arms, wide open thrown,
            Now never to be satisfied!Ere I could make my love my own
            She closed her amber eyes and died.they took no heed
            How frail she was, my little one,
   But brought her here with cruel speed
            Beneath the fierce, relentless sun.We laid her on the marriage bed
            The bridal flowers in her hand,
   A maiden from the ocean led
            Only, alas!I walk alone; the air is sweet,
            The white road wanders to the sea,
   I dream of those two little feet
            That grew so tired in reaching me.Adoration

   Who does not feel desire unending
     To solace through his daily strife,
   With some mysterious Mental Blending,
     The hungry loneliness of life?Until, by sudden passion shaken,
     As terriers shake a rat at play,
   He finds, all blindly, he has taken
     The old, Hereditary way.Yet, in the moment of communion,
     The very heart of passion's fire,
   His spirit spurns the mortal union,
     "Not this, not this, the Soul's desire!"*        *        *        *

   Oh You, by whom my life is riven,
     And reft away from my control,
   Take back the hours of passion given!Although I once, in ardent fashion,
     Implored you long to give me this;
   (In hopes to stem, or stifle, passion)
     Your hair to touch, your lips to kiss

   Now that your gracious self has granted
     The loveliness you hold as naught,
   I find, alas!not that I wanted--
     Possession has not stifled Thought.Desire its aim has only shifted,--
     Built hopes upon another plan,
   And I in love for you have drifted
     Beyond all passion known to man.Beyond all dreams of soft caresses
     The solacing of any kiss,--
   Beyond the fragrance of your tresses
     (Once I had sold my soul for this!)But now I crave no mortal union
     (Thanks for that sweetness in the past);
   I need some subtle, strange communion,
     Some sense that _I_ join _you_, at last.Long past the pulse and pain of passion,
     Long left the limits of all love,--
   I crave some nearer, fuller fashion,
     Some unknown way, beyond, above,--

   Some infinitely inner fusion,
     As Wave with Water; Flame with Fire,--
   Let me dream once the dear delusion
     That I am You, Oh, Heart's Desire!Your kindness lent to my caresses
     That beauty you so lightly prize,--
   The midnight of your sable tresses,
     The twilight of your shadowed eyes.Ah, for that gift all thanks are given!Yet, Oh, adored, beyond control,
   Count all the passionate past forgiven
     And love me once, once, from your soul.Three Songs of Zahir-u-Din

   The tropic day's redundant charms
     Cool twilight soothes away,
   The sun slips down behind the palms
     And leaves the landscape grey.I want to take you in my arms
           And kiss your lips away!I wake with sunshine in my eyes
     And find the morning blue,
   A night of dreams behind me lies
     And all were dreams of you!Ah, how I wish the while I rise,
           That what I dream were true.The weary day's laborious pace,
     I hasten and beguile
   By fancies, which I backwards trace
     To things I loved erstwhile;
           The weary sweetness of your face,
           Your faint, illusive smile.The silken softness of your hair
     Where faint bronze shadows are,
   Your strangely slight and youthful air,
     No passions seem to mar,--
           Oh, why, since Fate has made you fair,
           Must Fortune keep you far?Thus spent, the day so long and bright
     Less hot and brilliant seems,
   Till in a final flare of light
     The sun withdraws his beams.Then, in the coolness of the night,
           I meet you in my dreams!Second Song

   How much I loved that way you had
   Of smiling most, when very sad,
   A smile which carried tender hints
       Of delicate tints
       And warbling birds,
       Of sun and spring,
   And yet, more than all other thing,
   Of Weariness beyond all Words!None other ever smiled that way,
       None that I know,--
   The essence of all Gaiety lay,
   Of all mad mirth that men may know,
   In that sad smile, serene and slow,
   That on your lips was wont to play.It needed many delicate lines
   And subtle curves and roseate tints
   To make that weary radiant smile;
   It flickered, as beneath the vines
   The sunshine through green shadow glints
   On the pale path that lies below,
   Flickered and flashed, and died away,
   But the strange thoughts it woke meanwhile
       Were wont to stay.Thoughts of Strange Things you used to know
   In dim, dead lives, lived long ago,
   Some madly mirthful Merriment
   Whose lingering light is yet unspent,--
   Some unimaginable Woe,--
   Your strange, sad smile forgets these not,
   Though you, yourself, long since, forgot!Third Song, written during Fever

   To-night the clouds hang very low,
       They take the Hill-tops to their breast,
       And lay their arms about the fields.The wind that fans me lying low,
       Restless with great desire for rest,
       No cooling touch of freshness yields.I, sleepless through the stifling heat,
       Watch the pale Lightning's constant glow
       Between the wide set open doors.I lie and long amidst the heat,--
       The fever that my senses know,
       For that cool slenderness of yours.A roseleaf that has lain in snow,
       A snowflake tinged with sunset fire.You do not know, so young you are,
       How Fever fans the senses' glow
       To uncontrollable desire!And fills the spaces of the night
       With furious and frantic thought,
       One would not dare to think by day.Ah, if you came to me to-night
       These visions would be turned to naught,
       These hateful dreams be held at bay!But you are far, and Loneliness
       My only lover through the night;
       And not for any word or prayer
   Would you console my loneliness
       Or lend yourself, serene and slight,
       And the cool clusters of your hair.All through the night I long for you,
       As shipwrecked men in tropics yearn
       For the fresh flow of streams and springs.My fevered fancies follow you
       As dying men in deserts turn
       Their thoughts to clear and chilly things.Such dreams are mine, and such my thirst,
       Unceasing and unsatisfied,
       Until the night is burnt away
   Among these dreams and fevered thirst,
       And, through the open doorways, glide
       The white feet of the coming day.The Regret of the Ranee in the Hall of Peacocks

   This man has taken my Husband's life
     And laid my Brethren low,
   No sister indeed, were I, no wife,
     To pardon and let him go.Yet why does he look so young and slim
     As he weak and wounded lies?How hard for me to be harsh to him
     With his soft, appealing eyes.His hair is ruffled upon the stone
     And the slender wrists are bound,
   So young!and yet he has overthrown
     His scores on the battle ground.Would I were only a slave to-day,
     To whom it were right and meet
   To wash the stains of the War away,
     The dust from the weary feet.Were I but one of my serving girls
     To solace his pain to rest!Shake out the sand from the soft loose curls,
     And hold him against my breast!Would God that I were the senseless stone
     To support his slender length!I hate those wounds that trouble my sight,
     Unknown!how I wish you lay,
   Alone in my silken tent to-night
     While I charmed the pain away.I would lay you down on the Royal bed,
     I would bathe your wounds with wine,
   And setting your feet against my head
     Dream you were lover of mine.My Crown is heavy upon my hair,
     The Jewels weigh on my breast,
   All I would leave, with delight, to share
     Your pale and passionate rest!But hands grow restless about their swords,
     Lips murmur below their breath,
   "The Queen is silent too long!""My Lords,
     --Take him away to death!"Protest: By Zahir-u-Din

   Alas!this wasted Night
   With all its Jasmin-scented air,
   Its thousand stars, serenely bright!I lie alone, and long for you,
   Long for your Champa-scented hair,
   Your tranquil eyes of twilight hue;

   Long for the close-curved, delicate lips
   --Their sinuous sweetness laid on mine--
   Here, where the slender fountain drips,
   Here, where the yellow roses glow,
   Pale in the tender silver shine
   The stars across the garden throw.The poets hardly speak the truth,--
   Despite their praiseful litany,
   His season is not all delights
   Nor every night an ecstasy!The very power and passion that make--
   _Might_ make--his days one golden dream,
   How he must suffer for their sake!Till, in their fierce and futile rage,
   The baffled senses almost deem
   They might be happier in old age.Age that can find red roses sweet,
   And yet not crave a rose-red mouth;
   Hear Bulbuls, with no wish that feet
   Of sweeter singers went his way;
   Inhale warm breezes from the South,
   Yet never fed his fancy stray.From some near Village I can hear
   The cadenced throbbing of a drum,
   Now softly distant, now more near;
   And in an almost human fashion,
   It, plaintive, wistful, seems to come
   Laden with sighs of fitful passion,

   To mock me, lying here alone
   Among the thousand useless flowers
   Upon the fountain's border-stone--
   Cold stone, that chills me as I lie
   Counting the slowly passing hours
   By the white spangles in the sky.Some feast the Tom-toms celebrate,
   Where, close together, side by side,
   Gay in their gauze and tinsel state
   With lips serene and downcast eyes,
   Sit the young bridegroom and his bride,
   While round them songs and laughter rise.They are together; Why are we
   So hopelessly, so far apart?Oh, I implore you, come to me!Come to me, Solace of mine eyes!A little, languid, mocking breeze
   That rustles through the Jasmin flowers
   And stirs among the Tamarind trees;
   A little gurgle of the spray
   That drips, unheard, though silent hours,
   Then breaks in sudden bubbling play.Why, therefore, mock at my repose?Is it my fault I am alone
   Beneath the feathery Tamarind tree
   Whose shadows over me are thrown?Nay, I am mad indeed, with thirst
   For all to me this night denied
   And drunk with longing, and accurst
   Beyond all chance of sleep or rest,
   With love, unslaked, unsatisfied,
   And dreams of beauty unpossessed.Hating the hour that brings you not,
   Mad at the space betwixt us twain,
   Sad for my empty arms, so hot
   And fevered, even the chilly stone
   Can scarcely cool their burning pain,--
   And oh, this sense of being alone!Take hence, O Night, your wasted hours,
   You bring me not my Life's Delight,
   My Star of Stars, my Flower of Flowers!You leave me loveless and forlorn,
   Pass on, most false and futile night,
   Pass on, and perish in the Dawn!Famine Song

   Death and Famine on every side
       And never a sign of rain,
   The bones of those who have starved and died
       Unburied upon the plain.What care have I that the bones bleach white?To-morrow they may be mine,
   But I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!Cholera, Riot, and Sudden Death,
       And the brave red blood set free,
   The glazing eye and the failing breath,--
       But what are these things to me?Your breath is quick and your eyes are bright
       And your blood is red like wine,
   And I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And hold your lips with mine!I hear the sound of a thousand tears,
       Like softly pattering rain,
   I see the fever, folly, and fears
       Fulfilling man's tale of pain.But for the moment your star is bright,
       I revel beneath its shine,
   For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!And you need not deem me over cold,
       That I do not stop to think
   For all the pleasure this Life may hold
       Is on the Precipice brink.Thought could but lessen my soul's delight,
       And to-day she may not pine.For I shall lie in your arms to-night
       And close your lips with mine!I trust what sorrow the Fates may send
       I may carry quietly through,
   And pray for grace when I reach the end,
       To die as a man should do.To-day, at least, must be clear and bright,
       Without a sorrowful sign,
   Because I sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!So on I work, in the blazing sun,
       To bury what dead we may,
   But glad, oh, glad, when the day is done
       And the night falls round us grey.Would those we covered away from sight
       Had a rest as sweet as mine!For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!The Window Overlooking the Harbour

   Sad is the Evening: all the level sand
     Lies left and lonely, while the restless sea,
   Tired of the green caresses of the land,
     Withdraws into its own infinity.But still more sad this white and chilly Dawn
     Filling the vacant spaces of the sky,
   While little winds blow here and there forlorn
     And all the stars, weary of shining, die.And more than desolate, to wake, to rise,
     Leaving the couch, where softly sleeping still,
   What through the past night made my heaven, lies;
     And looking out across the window sill

   See, from the upper window's vantage ground,
     Mankind slip into harness once again,
   And wearily resume his daily round
     Of love and labour, toil and strife and pain.How the sad thoughts slip back across the night:
     The whole thing seems so aimless and so vain.What use the raptures, passion and delight,
     Burnt out; as though they could not wake again.The worn-out nerves and weary brain repeat
     The question: Whither all these passions tend;--
   This curious thirst, so painful and so sweet,
     So fierce, so very short-lived, to what end?Even, if seeking for ourselves, the Race,
     The only immortality we know,--
   Even if from the flower of our embrace
     Some spark should kindle, or some fruit should grow,

   What were the use?the gain, to us or it,
     That we should cause another You or Me,--
   Another life, from our light passion lit,
     To suffer like ourselves awhile and die.Our being runs
     In a closed circle.All we know or see
   Tends to assure us that a thousand Suns,
     Teeming perchance with life, have ceased to be.Ah, the grey Dawn seems more than desolate,
     And the past night of passion worse than waste,
   Love but a useless flower, that soon or late,
     Turns to a fruit with bitter aftertaste.Youth, even Youth, seems futile and forlorn
     While the new day grows slowly white above.Pale and reproachful comes the chilly Dawn
     After the fervour of a night of love.Back to the Border

   The tremulous morning is breaking
     Against the white waste of the sky,
   And hundreds of birds are awaking
     In tamarisk bushes hard by.I, waiting alone in the station,
     Can hear in the distance, grey-blue,
   The sound of that iron desolation,
     The train that will bear me from you.'T will carry me under your casement,
     You'll feel in your dreams as you lie
   The quiver, from gable to basement,
     The rush of my train sweeping by.And I shall look out as I pass it,--
     Your dear, unforgettable door,
   'T was _ours_ till last night, but alas!it
     Will never be mine any more.Through twilight blue-grey and uncertain,
     Where frost leaves the window-pane free,
   I'll look at the tinsel-edged curtain
     That hid so much pleasure for me.I go to my long undone duty
     Alone in the chill and the gloom,
   My eyes are still full of the beauty
     I leave in your rose-scented room.Lie still in your dreams; for your tresses
     Are free of my lingering kiss.I keep you awake with caresses
     No longer; be happy in this!From passion you told me you hated
     You're now and for ever set free,
   I pass in my train, sorrow-weighted,
     Your house that was Heaven to me.You won't find a trace, when you waken,
     Of me or my love of the past,
   Rise up and rejoice!I have taken
     My longed-for departure at last.My fervent and useless persistence
     You never need suffer again,
   Nor even perceive in the distance
     The smoke of my vanishing train!Reverie: Zahir-u-Din

   Alone, I wait, till her twilight gate
                        The Night slips quietly through,
   With shadow and gloom, and purple bloom,
                        Flung over the Zenith blue.Her stars that tremble, would fain dissemble
                        Light over lovers thrown,--
   Her hush and mystery know no history
                        Such as day may own.Day has record of pleasure and pain,
   But things that are done by Night remain
                        For ever and ever unknown.For a thousand years, 'neath a thousand skies,
                        Night has brought men love;
   Therefore the old, old longings rise
                        As the light grows dim above.Therefore, now that the shadows close,
                        And the mists weird and white,
   While Time is scented with musk and rose;
                        Magic with silver light.I long for love; will you grant me some?as lovers have always come,
                        Through the evenings of the Past.Swiftly, as lovers have always come,
   Softly, as lovers have always come
                        Through the long-forgotten Past.Sea Song

   Against the planks of the cabin side,
       (So slight a thing between them and me,)
   The great waves thundered and throbbed and sighed,
       The great green waves of the Indian sea!Your face was white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled,
   I would we had steamed and reached that night
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world.The wind blew in through the open port,
       So freshly joyous and salt and free,
   Your hair it lifted, your lips it sought,
       And then swept back to the open sea.The engines throbbed with their constant beat;
       Your heart was nearer, and all I heard;
   Your lips were salt, but I found them sweet,
       While, acquiescent, you spoke no word.So straight you lay in your narrow berth,
       Rocked by the waves; and you seemed to be
   Essence of all that is sweet on earth,
       Of all that is sad and strange at sea.And you were white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled.had we but sailed and reached that night,
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world!'T is eight miles out and eight miles in,
        Just at the break of morn.'T is ice without and flame within,
        To gain a kiss at dawn!Far, where the Lilac Hills arise
        Soft from the misty plain,
   A lone enchanted hollow lies
        Where I at last drew rein.Midwinter grips this lonely land,
        This stony, treeless waste,
   Where East, due East, across the sand,
        We fly in fevered haste.the East will soon be red,
        The wild duck westward fly,
   And make above my anxious head,
        Triangles in the sky.Like wind we go; we both are still
        So young; all thanks to Fate!(It cuts like knives, this air so chill,)
        Dear God!Behind us, wrapped in mist and sleep
        The Ruined City lies,
   (Although we race, we seem to creep!)Eight miles out only, eight miles in,
        Good going all the way;
   But more and more the clouds begin
        To redden into day.And every snow-tipped peak grows pink
        An iridescent gem!My heart beats quick, with joy, to think
        How I am nearing them!As mile on mile behind us falls,
        Till, Oh, delight!I see
   My Heart's Desire, who softly calls
        Across the gloom to me.The utter joy of that First Love
        No later love has given,
   When, while the skies grew light above,
        We entered into Heaven.Till I Wake

   When I am dying, lean over me tenderly, softly,
     Stoop, as the yellow roses droop in the wind from the South.So I may, when I wake, if there be an Awakening,
     Keep, what lulled me to sleep, the touch of your lips on my mouth.His Rubies: Told by Valgovind

   Along the hot and endless road,
     Calm and erect, with haggard eyes,
   The prisoner bore his fetters' load
     Beneath the scorching, azure skies.Serene and tall, with brows unbent,
     Without a hope, without a friend,
   He, under escort, onward went,
     With death to meet him at the end.The Poppy fields were pink and gay
     On either side, and in the heat
   Their drowsy scent exhaled all day
     A dream-like fragrance almost sweet.And when the cool of evening fell
     And tender colours touched the sky,
   He still felt youth within him dwell
     And half forgot he had to die.Sometimes at night, the Camp-fires lit
     And casting fitful light around,
   His guard would, friend-like, let him sit
     And talk awhile with them, unbound.Thus they, the night before the last,
     Were resting, when a group of girls
   Across the small encampment passed,
     With laughing lips and scented curls.Then in the Prisoner's weary eyes
     A sudden light lit up once more,
   The women saw him with surprise,
     And pity for the chains he bore.For little women reck of Crime
     If young and fair the criminal be
   Here in this tropic, amorous clime
     Where love is still untamed and free.And one there was, she walked less fast,
     Behind the rest, perhaps beguiled
   By his lithe form, who, as she passed,
     Waited a little while, and smiled.The guard, in kindly Eastern fashion,
     Smiled to themselves, and let her stay.So tolerant of human passion,
     "To love he has but one more day."Yet when (the soft and scented gloom
     Scarce lighted by the dying fire)
   His arms caressed her youth and bloom,
     With him it was not all desire."For me," he whispered, as he lay,
     "But little life remains to live.One thing I crave to take away:
     You have the gift; but will you give?"If I could know some child of mine
     Would live his life, and see the sun
   Across these fields of poppies shine,
     What should I care that mine is done?"To die would not be dying quite,
     Leaving a little life behind,
   You, were you kind to me to-night,
     Could grant me this; but--are you kind?"See, I have something here for you
     For you and It, if It there be."Soft in the gloom her glances grew,
     With gentle tears he could not see.He took the chain from off his neck,
     Hid in the silver chain there lay
   Three rubies, without flaw or fleck.He drew her close; the moonless skies
     Shed little light; the fire was dead.Soft pity filled her youthful eyes,
     And many tender things she said.Throughout the hot and silent night
     All that he asked of her she gave.And, left alone ere morning light,
     He went serenely to the grave,

   Happy; for even when the rope
     Confined his neck, his thoughts were free,
   And centered round his Secret Hope
     The little life that was to be.When Poppies bloomed again, she bore
     His child who gaily laughed and crowed,
   While round his tiny neck he wore
     The rubies given on the road.For his small sake she wished to wait,
     But vainly to forget she tried,
   And grieving for the Prisoner's fate,
     She broke her gentle heart and died.Song of Taj Mahomed

   Dear is my inlaid sword; across the Border
   It brought me much reward; dear is my Mistress,
   The jewelled treasure of an amorous hour.Dear beyond measure are my dreams and Fancies.These I adore; for these I live and labour,
   Holding them more than sword or jewelled Mistress,
   For this indeed may rust, and that prove faithless,
   But, till my limbs are dust, I have my Fancies.The Garden of Kama:

   Kama the Indian Eros

   The daylight is dying,
   The Flying fox flying,
         Amber and amethyst burn in the sky.See, the sun throws a late,
   Lingering, roseate
         Kiss to the landscape to bid it good-bye.Oh, come, unresisting,
         Lovely, expectant, on tentative feet.Shadow shall cover us,
   Roses bend over us,
         Making a bride chamber, sacred and sweet.We know not life's reason,
   The length of its season,
         Know not if they know, the great Ones above.We none of us sought it,
   And few could support it,
         Were it not gilt with the glamour of love.But much is forgiven
   To Gods who have given,
         If but for an hour, the Rapture of Youth.You do not yet know it,
   But Kama shall show it,
         Changing your dreams to his Exquisite Truth.The Fireflies shall light you,
   And naught shall afright you,
         Nothing shall trouble the Flight of the Hours.Come, for I wait for you,
   Night is too late for you,
         Come, while the twilight is closing the flowers.Every breeze still is,
   And, scented with lilies,
         Cooled by the twilight, refreshed by the dew,
   The garden lies breathless,
   Where Kama, the Deathless,
         In the hushed starlight, is waiting for you.Camp Follower's Song, Gomal River

   We have left Gul Kach behind us,
      Are marching on Apozai,--
   Where pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.We're falling back from the Gomal,
      Across the Gir-dao plain,
   The camping ground is deserted,
      We'll never come back again.Along the rocks and the defiles,
      The mules and the camels wind.Good-bye to Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind.For some we lost in the skirmish,
      And some were killed in the fight,
   But he was captured by fever,
      In the sentry pit, at night.A rifle shot had been swifter,
      Less trouble a sabre thrust,
   But his Fate decided fever,
      And each man dies as he must.The wavering flames rise high,
   The flames of our burning grass-huts,
      Against the black of the sky.We hear the sound of the river,
      An ever-lessening moan,
   The hearts of us all turn backwards
      To where he is left alone.We sing up a little louder,
      We know that we feel bereft,
   We're leaving the camp together,
      And only one of us left.The only one, out of many,
      And each must come to his end,
   I wish I could stop this singing,
      He happened to be my friend.We're falling back from the Gomal
      We're marching on Apozai,
   And pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.Perhaps the feast will taste bitter,
      The lips of the girls less kind,--
   Because of Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind!Song of the Colours: by Taj Mahomed

   _Rose-colour_
   Rose Pink am I, the colour gleams and glows
     In many a flower; her lips, those tender doors
   By which, in time of love, love's essence flows
     From him to her, are dyed in delicate Rose.Mine is the earliest Ruby light that pours
     Out of the East, when day's white gates unclose.On downy peach, and maiden's downier cheek
     I, in a flush of radiant bloom, alight,
   Clinging, at sunset, to the shimmering peak
     I veil its snow in floods of Roseate light._Azure_
   Mine is the heavenly hue of Azure skies,
     Where the white clouds lie soft as seraphs' wings,
   Mine the sweet, shadowed light in innocent eyes,
     Whose lovely looks light only on lovely things.Mine the Blue Distance, delicate and clear,
     Mine the Blue Glory of the morning sea,
   All that the soul so longs for, finds not here,
     Fond eyes deceive themselves, and find in me.to the Royal Red of living Blood,
     Let loose by steel in spirit-freeing flood,
   Forced from faint forms, by toil or torture torn
     Staining the patient gates of life new born.Colour of War and Rage, of Pomp and Show,
     Banners that flash, red flags that flaunt and glow,
   Colour of Carnage, Glory, also Shame,
     Raiment of women women may not name.I hide in mines, where unborn Rubies dwell,
     Flicker and flare in fitful fire in Hell,
   The outpressed life-blood of the grape is mine,
     Hail!Strong am I, over strong, to eyes that tire,
     In the hot hue of Rapine, Riot, Flame.Death and Despair are black, War and Desire,
     The two red cards in Life's unequal game._Green_
   I am the Life of Forests, and Wandering Streams,
     Green as the feathery reeds the Florican love,
   Young as a maiden, who of her marriage dreams,
     Still sweetly inexperienced in ways of Love.Colour of Youth and Hope, some waves are mine,
     Some emerald reaches of the evening sky.See, in the Spring, my sweet green Promise shine,
     Never to be fulfilled, of by and by.Never to be fulfilled; leaves bud, and ever
     Something is wanting, something falls behind;
   The flowered Solstice comes indeed, but never
     That light and lovely summer men divined._Violet_
   I were the colour of Things, (if hue they had)
         That are hard to name.Of curious, twisted thoughts that men call "mad"
         Or oftener "shame."Of that delicate vice, that is hardly vice,
         So reticent, rare,
   Ethereal, as the scent of buds and spice,
         In this Eastern air.On palm-fringed shores I colour the Cowrie shell,
         With its edges curled;
   And, deep in Datura poison buds, I dwell
         In a perfumed world.My lilac tinges the edge of the evening sky
         Where the sunset clings.My purple lends an Imperial Majesty
         To the robes of kings._Yellow_
   Gold am I, and for me, ever men curse and pray,
     Selling their souls and each other, by night and day.A sordid colour, and yet, I make some things fair,
     Dying sunsets, fields of corn, and a maiden's hair.Thus they discoursed in the daytime,--Violet, Yellow, and Blue,
     Emerald, Scarlet, and Rose-colour, the pink and perfect hue.Thus they spoke in the sunshine, when their beauty was manifest,
     Till the Night came, and the Silence, and gave them an equal rest.Lalila, to the Ferengi Lover

   Why above others was I so blessed
      And honoured?to be chosen one
   To hold you, sleeping, against my breast,
      As now I may hold your only son.You gave your life to me in a kiss;
   Have I done well, for that past delight,
      In return, to have given you this?Look down at his face, your face, beloved,
      His eyes are azure as yours are blue.In every line of his form is proved
      How well I loved you, and only you.I felt the secret hope at my heart
      Turned suddenly to the living joy,
   And knew that your life and mine had part
      As golden grains in a brass alloy.And learning thus, that your child was mine,
      Thrilled by the sense of its stirring life,
   I held myself as a sacred shrine
      Afar from pleasure, and pain, and strife,

   That all unworthy I might not be
      Of that you had deigned to cause to dwell
   Hidden away in the heart of me,
      As white pearls hide in a dusky shell.Do you remember, when first you laid
      Your lips on mine, that enchanted night?My eyes were timid, my lips afraid,
      You seemed so slender and strangely white.I always tremble; the moments flew
      Swiftly to dawn that took you away,
   But this is a small and lovely you
      Content to rest in my arms all day.Oh, since you have sought me, Lord, for this,
      And given your only child to me,
   My life devoted to yours and his,
      Whilst I am living, will always be.And after death, through the long To Be,
      (Which, I think, must surely keep love's laws,)
   I, should you chance to have need of me,
      Am ever and always, only yours.On the City Wall

   Upon the City Ramparts, lit up by sunset gleam,
   The Blue eyes that conquer, meet the Darker eyes that dream.The Dark eyes, so Eastern, and the Blue eyes from the West,
   The last alight with action, the first so full of rest.Brown, that seem to hold the Past; its magic mystery,
   Blue, that catch the early light, of ages yet to be.Meet and fall and meet again, then linger, look, and smile,
   Time and distance all forgotten, for a little while.Happy on the city wall, in the warm spring weather,
   All the force of Nature's laws, drawing them together.East and West so gaily blending, for a little space,
   All the sunshine seems to centre, round th' Enchanted place!One rides down the dusty road, one watches from the wall,
   Azure eyes would fain return, and Amber eyes recall;

   Would fain be on the ramparts, and resting heart to heart,
   But time o' love is overpast, East and West must part.Those are dim, and ride away, these cry themselves to sleep._"Oh, since Love is all so short, the sob so near the smile,_
   _Blue eyes that always conquer us, is it worth your while?"_





"Love Lightly"

   There were Roses in the hedges, and Sunshine in the sky,
   Red Lilies in the sedges, where the water rippled by,
   A thousand Bulbuls singing, oh, how jubilant they were,
   And a thousand flowers flinging their sweetness on the air.But you, who sat beside me, had a shadow in your eyes,
   Their sadness seemed to chide me, when I gave you scant replies;
   You asked "Did I remember?"In vain you fanned the ember, for the love flame was not there."And so, since you are tired of me, you ask me to forget,
     What is the use of caring, now that you no longer care?When Love is dead his Memory can only bring regret,
     But how can I forget you with the flowers in your hair?"What use the scented Roses, or the azure of the sky?They are sweet when Love reposes, but then he had to die.What could I do in leaving you, but ask you to forget,--
   I suffered, too, in grieving you; I all but loved you yet.But half love is a treason, that no lover can forgive,
   I had loved you for a season, I had no more to give.You saw my passion faltered, for I could but let you see,
   And it was not I that altered, but Fate that altered me.And so, since I am tired of love, I ask you to forget,
     What is the use you caring, now that I no longer care?When Love is dead, his Memory can only bring regret;
     Forget me, oh, forget me, and my flower-scented hair!No Rival Like the Past

   As those who eat a Luscious Fruit, sunbaked,
     Full of sweet juice, with zest, until they find
   It finished, and their appetite unslaked,
     And so return and eat the pared-off rind;--

   We, who in Youth, set white and careless teeth
     In the Ripe Fruits of Pleasure while they last,
   Later, creep back to gnaw the cast-off sheath,
     And find there is no Rival like the Past.Verse by Taj Mahomed

   When first I loved, I gave my very soul
   Utterly unreserved to Love's control,
   But Love deceived me, wrenched my youth away
   And made the gold of life for ever grey.Long I lived lonely, yet I tried in vain
   With any other Joy to stifle pain;
   There _is_ no other joy, I learned to know,
   And so returned to Love, as long ago.Yet I, this little while ere I go hence,
   Love very lightly now, in self-defence.Lines by Taj Mahomed

   This passion is but an ember
     Of a Sun, of a Fire, long set;
   I could not live and remember,
     And so I love and forget.You say, and the tone is fretful,
     That my mourning days were few,
   You call me over forgetful--
     My God, if you only knew!There is no Breeze to Cool the Heat of Love

   The listless Palm-trees catch the breeze above
     The pile-built huts that edge the salt Lagoon,
   There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love,
     No wind from land or sea, at night or noon.Perfumed and robed I wait, my Lord, for you,
     And my heart waits alert, with strained delight,
   My flowers are loath to close, as though they knew
     That you will come to me before the night.In the Verandah all the lights are lit,
     And softly veiled in rose to please your eyes,
   Between the pillars flying foxes flit,
     Their wings transparent on the lilac skies.Come soon, my Lord, come soon, I almost fear
     My heart may fail me in this keen suspense,
   Break with delight, at last, to know you near.Pleasure is one with Pain, if too intense.I envy these: the steps that you will tread,
     The jasmin that will touch you by its leaves,
   When, in your slender height, you stoop your head
     At the low door beneath the palm-thatched eaves.For though you utterly belong to me,
     And love has done his utmost 'twixt us twain,
   Your slightest, careless touch yet seems to be
     That keen delight so much akin to pain.The night breeze blows across the still Lagoon,
     And stirs the Palm-trees till they wave above
   Our pile-built huts; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Every time you give yourself to me,
     The gift seems greater, and yourself more fair,
   This slight-built, palm-thatched hut has come to be
     A temple, since, my Lord, you visit there.And as the water, gurgling softly, goes
     Among the piles beneath the slender floor;
   I hear it murmur, as it seaward flows,
     Of the great Wonder seen upon the shore.The Miracle, that you should come to me,
     Whom the whole world, seeing, can but desire,
   It is as though some White Star stooped to be
     The messmate of our little cooking fire.Leaving the Glory of his Purple Skies,
     And the White Friendship of the Crescent Moon,
   And yet;--I look into your brilliant eyes,
     And find content; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon.Perfumed and robed I wait for you, I wait,
     The flowers that please you wreathed about my hair,
   And this poor face set forth in jewelled state,
     So more than proud since you have found it fair.My lute is ready, and the fragrant drink
     Your lips may honour, how it will rejoice
   Losing its life in yours!the lute I think
     But wastes the time when I might hear your voice.Your slightest, as your utmost, wish or will,
   Whether it please you to caress or slay,
     It would please me to give obedience still.I would delight to die beneath your kiss;
     I envy that young maiden who was slain,
   So her warm blood, flowing beneath the kiss,
     Might ease the wounded Sultan of his pain--

   If she loved him as I love you, my Lord.There is no pleasure on the earth so sweet
   As is the pain endured for one adored;
     If I lay crushed beneath your slender feet

   I should be happy!Ah, come soon, come soon,
     See how the stars grow large and white above,
   The land breeze blows across the salt Lagoon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Malay Song

   The Stars await, serene and white,
     The unarisen moon;
   Oh, come and stay with me to-night,
     Beside the salt Lagoon!My hut is small, but as you lie,
     You see the lighted shore,
   And hear the rippling water sigh
     Beneath the pile-raised floor.No gift have I of jewels or flowers,
     My room is poor and bare:
   But all the silver sea is ours,
     And all the scented air

   Blown from the mainland, where there grows
     Th' "Intriguer of the Night,"
   The flower that you have named Tube rose,
     Sweet scented, slim, and white.The flower that, when the air is still
     And no land breezes blow,
   From its pale petals can distil
     A phosphorescent glow.I see your ship at anchor ride;
     Her "captive lightning" shine.Before she takes to-morrow's tide,
     Let this one night be mine!Though in the language of your land
     My words are poor and few,
   Oh, read my eyes, and understand,
     I give my youth to you!The Temple Dancing Girl

   You will be mine; those lightly dancing feet,
     Falling as softly on the careless street
   As the wind-loosened petals of a flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.And all the Temple's little links and laws
     Will not for long protect your loveliness.I have a stronger force to aid my cause,
     Nature's great Law, to love and to possess!Throughout those sleepless watches, when I lay
     Wakeful, desiring what I might not see,
   I knew (it helped those hours, from dusk to day),
     In this one thing, Fate would be kind to me.You will consent, through all my veins like wine
     This prescience flows; your lips meet mine above,
   Your clear soft eyes look upward into mine
     Dim in a silent ecstasy of love.The clustered softness of your waving hair,
     That curious paleness which enchants me so,
   And all your delicate strength and youthful air,
     Destiny will compel you to bestow!Refuse, withdraw, and hesitate awhile,
     Your young reluctance does but fan the flame;
   My partner, Love, waits, with a tender smile,
     Who play against him play a losing game.I, strong in nothing else, have strength in this,
     The subtlest, most resistless, force we know
   Is aiding me; and you must stoop and kiss:
     The genius of the race will have it so!Yet, make it not too long, nor too intense
     My thirst; lest I should break beneath the strain,
   And the worn nerves, and over-wearied sense,
     Enjoy not what they spent themselves to gain.Lest, in the hour when you consent to share
     That human passion Beauty makes divine,
   I, over worn, should find you over fair,
     Lest I should die before I make you mine.You will consent, those slim, reluctant feet,
     Falling as lightly on the careless street
   As the white petals of a wind-worn flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.Hira-Singh's Farewell to Burmah

   On the wooden deck of the wooden Junk, silent, alone, we lie,
   With silver foam about the bow, and a silver moon in the sky:
   A glimmer of dimmer silver here, from the anklets round your feet,
   Our lips may close on each other's lips, but never our souls may meet.For though in my arms you lie at rest, your name I have never heard,
   To carry a thought between us two, we have not a single word.And yet what matter we do not speak, when the ardent eyes have spoken,
   The way of love is a sweeter way, when the silence is unbroken.As a wayward Fancy, tired at times, of the cultured Damask Rose,
   Drifts away to the tangled copse, where the wild Anemone grows;
   So the ordered and licit love ashore, is hardly fresh and free
   As this light love in the open wind and salt of the outer sea.So sweet you are, with your tinted cheeks and your small caressive hands,
   What if I carried you home with me, where our Golden Temple stands?Yet, this were folly indeed; to bind, in fetters of permanence,
   A passing dream whose enchantment charms because of its trancience.Life is ever a slave to Time; we have but an hour to rest,
   Her steam is up and her lighters leave, the vessel that takes me west;
   And never again we two shall meet, as we chance to meet to-night,
   On the Junk, whose painted eyes gaze forth, in desolate want of sight.And what is love at its best, but this?Conceived by a passing glance,
   Nursed and reared in a transient mood, on a drifting Sea of Chance.For rudderless craft are all our loves, among the rocks and the shoals,
   Well we may know one another's speech, but never each other's souls.Give here your lips and kiss me again, we have but a moment more,
   Before we set the sail to the mast, before we loosen the oar.Good-bye to you, and my thanks to you, for the rest you let me share,
   While this night drifted away to the Past, to join the Nights that Were.Starlight

   O beautiful Stars, when you see me go
     Hither and thither, in search of love,
   Do you think me faithless, who gleam and glow
     Serene and fixed in the blue above?O Stars, so golden, it is not so.But there is a garden I dare not see,
     There is a place where I fear to go,
   Since the charm and glory of life to me
     The brown earth covered there, long ago.O Stars, you saw it, you know, you know.Hither and thither I wandering go,
     With aimless haste and wearying fret;
   In a search for pleasure and love?Not so,
     Seeking desperately to forget.You see so many, O Stars, you know.Sampan Song

   A little breeze blew over the sea,
       And it came from far away,
   Across the fields of millet and rice,
   All warm with sunshine and sweet with spice,
   It lifted his curls and kissed him thrice,
       As upon the deck he lay.It said, "Oh, idle upon the sea,
       Awake and with sleep have done,
   Haul up the widest sail of the prow,
   And come with me to the rice fields now,
   She longs, oh, how can I tell you how,
       To show you your first-born son!"Song of the Devoted Slave

   There is one God: Mahomed his Prophet.Had I his power
   I would take the topmost peaks of the snow-clad Himalayas,
   And would range them around your dwelling, during the heats of summer,
   To cool the airs that fan your serene and delicate presence,
                   Had I the power.Your courtyard should ever be filled with the fleetest of camels
   Laden with inlaid armour, jewels and trappings for horses,
   Ripe dates from Egypt, and spices and musk from Arabia.And the sacred waters of Zem-Zem well, transported thither,
   Should bubble and flow in your chamber, to bathe the delicate
   Slender and wayworn feet of my Lord, returning from travel,
                   Had I the power.Fine woven silk, from the further East, should conceal your beauty,
   Clinging around you in amorous folds; caressive, silken,
   Beautiful long-lashed, sweet-voiced Persian boys should, kneeling, serve you,
   And the floor beneath your sandalled feet should be smooth and golden,
                   Had I the power.And if ever your clear and stately thoughts should turn to women,
   Kings' daughters, maidens, should be appointed to your caresses,
   That the youth and the strength of my Lord might never be wasted
   In light or sterile love; but enrich the world with his children.Whilst I should sit in the outer court of the Water Palace
   To await the time when you went forth, for Pleasure or Warfare,
   Descending the stairs rose crowned, or armed and arrayed in purple,--
   To mark the place where your steps have fallen, and kiss the footprints,
                   Had I the power.The Singer

   The singer only sang the Joy of Life,
     For all too well, alas!the singer knew
   How hard the daily toil, how keen the strife,
     How salt the falling tear; the joys how few.He who thinks hard soon finds it hard to live,
     Learning the Secret Bitterness of Things:
   So, leaving thought, the singer strove to give
     A level lightness to his lyric strings.He only sang of Love; its joy and pain,
     But each man in his early season loves;
   Each finds the old, lost Paradise again,
     Unfolding leaves, and roses, nesting doves.And though that sunlit time flies all too fleetly,
     Delightful Days that dance away too soon!Its early morning freshness lingers sweetly
     Throughout life's grey and tedious afternoon.And he, whose dreams enshrine her tender eyes,
     And she, whose senses wait his waking hand,
   Impatient youth, that tired but sleepless lies,
     Will read perhaps, and reading, understand.Oh, roseate lips he would have loved to kiss,
     Oh, eager lovers that he never knew!What should you know of him, or words of his?--
     But all the songs he sang were sung for you!Malaria

   He lurks among the reeds, beside the marsh,
     Red oleanders twisted in His hair,
   His eyes are haggard and His lips are harsh,
     Upon His breast the bones show gaunt and bare.The green and stagnant waters lick His feet,
     And from their filmy, iridescent scum
   Clouds of mosquitoes, gauzy in the heat,
     Rise with His gifts: Death and Delirium.His messengers: They bear the deadly taint
     On spangled wings aloft and far away,
   Making thin music, strident and yet faint,
     From golden eve to silver break of day.The baffled sleeper hears th' incessant whine
     Through his tormented dreams, and finds no rest
   The thirsty insects use his blood for wine,
     Probe his blue veins and pasture on his breast.While far away He in the marshes lies,
     Staining the stagnant water with His breath,
   An endless hunger burning in His eyes,
     A famine unassuaged, whose food is Death.He hides among the ghostly mists that float
     Over the water, weird and white and chill,
   And peasants, passing in their laden boat,
     Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill.A thousand burn and die; He takes no heed,
     Their bones, unburied, strewn upon the plain,
   Only increase the frenzy of His greed
     To add more victims to th' already slain.He loves the haggard frame, the shattered mind,
     Gloats with delight upon the glazing eye,
   Yet, in one thing, His cruelty is kind,
     He sends them lovely dreams before they die;

   Dreams that bestow on them their heart's desire,
     Visions that find them mad, and leave them blest,
   To sink, forgetful of the fever's fire,
     Softly, as in a lover's arms, to rest.Fancy

   Far in the Further East the skilful craftsman
       Fashioned this fancy for the West's delight.This rose and azure Dragon, crouching softly
       Upon the satin skin, close-grained and white.And you lay silent, while his slender needles
       Pricked the intricate pattern on your arm,
   Combining deftly Cruelty and Beauty,
       That subtle union, whose child is charm.Charm irresistible: the lovely something
       We follow in our dreams, but may not reach.The unattainable Divine Enchantment,
       Hinted in music, never heard in speech.This from the blue design exhales towards me,
       As incense rises from the Homes of Prayer,
   While the unfettered eyes, allured and rested,
       Urge the forbidden lips to stoop and share;

   Share in the sweetness of the rose and azure
       Traced in the Dragon's form upon the white
   Curve of the arm.Ah, curb thyself, my fancy,
       Where would'st thou drift in this enchanted flight?Feroza

   The evening sky was as green as Jade,
      As Emerald turf by Lotus lake,
   Behind the Kafila far she strayed,
      (The Pearls are lost if the Necklace break!)A lingering freshness touched the air
      From palm-trees, clustered around a Spring,
   The great, grim Desert lay vast and bare,
      But Youth is ever a careless thing.The Raiders threw her upon the sand,
      Men of the Wilderness know no laws,
   They tore the Amethysts off her hand,
      And rent the folds of her veiling gauze.They struck the lips that they might have kissed,
      Pitiless they to her pain and fear,
   And wrenched the gold from her broken wrist,
      No use to cry; there were none to hear.Her scarlet mouth and her onyx eyes,
      Her braided hair in its silken sheen,
   Were surely meet for a Lover's prize,
      But Fate dissented, and stepped between.Across the Zenith the vultures fly,
      Cruel of beak and heavy of wing.This Month the Almonds Bloom at Kandahar

   I hate this City, seated on the Plain,
     The clang and clamour of the hot Bazar,
   Knowing, amid the pauses of my pain,
     This month the Almonds bloom in Kandahar.The Almond-trees, that sheltered my Delight,
     Screening my happiness as evening fell.It was well worth--that most Enchanted Night--
     This life in torment, and the next in Hell!People are kind to me; one More than Kind,
     Her lashes lie like fans upon her cheek,
   But kindness is a burden on my mind,
     And it is weariness to hear her speak.For though that Kaffir's bullet holds me here,
     My thoughts are ever free, and wander far,
   To where the Lilac Hills rise, soft and clear,
     Beyond the Almond Groves of Kandahar.He followed me to Sibi, to the Fair,
     The Horse-fair, where he shot me weeks ago,
   But since they fettered him I have no care
     That my returning steps to health are slow.They will not loose him till they know my fate,
     And I rest here till I am strong to slay,
   Meantime, my Heart's Delight may safely wait
     Among the Almond blossoms, sweet as they.Well, he won by day,
     But I won, what I so desired, by night,
   _My_ arms held what his lack till Judgment Day!Also, the game is not yet over--quite!Wait, Amir Ali, wait till I come forth
     To kill, before the Almond-trees are green,
   To raze thy very Memory from the North,
     _So that thou art not, and thou hast not been!_

   Aha!it is Duty
     To rid the World from Shiah dogs like thee,
   They are but ill-placed moles on Islam's beauty,
     Such as the Faithful cannot calmly see!Also thy bullet hurts me not a little,
     Thy Shiah blood might serve to salve the ill.Maybe some Afghan Promises are brittle;
     Never a Promise to oneself, to kill!Now I grow stronger, I have days of leisure
     To shape my coming Vengeance as I lie,
   And, undisturbed by call of War or Pleasure,
     Can dream of many ways a man may die.I shall not torture thee, thy friends might rally,
     Some Fate assist thee and prove false to me;
   Oh!shouldst thou now escape me, Amir Ali,
     This would torment me through Eternity!Aye, Shuffa-Jan, I will be quiet indeed,
     Give here the Hakim's powder if thou wilt,
   And thou mayst sit, for I perceive thy need,
     And rest thy soft-haired head upon my quilt.Thy gentle love will not disturb a mind
     That loves and hates beneath a fiercer Star.Also, thou know'st, my Heart is left behind,
     Among the Almond-trees of Kandahar!End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of India's Love Lyrics, by 
Adela Florence Cory Nicolson (AKA Laurence Hope), et al.“You know what you said about wanting
experiences which were out of the way.If you think you’ve got one here,
we’ll slide down to the green grass.”

It was late in November and the hot, dry season of the South American
continent was on.Far below the boys could see the dark green of
luxuriant vegetation, while all around them lay the bare brown peaks of
lofty plateaus and lifting mountain cones.As it was somewhere near the middle of the afternoon, the boys lost no
time in packing their camp equipage and provisions on the aeroplanes.In
order to find a suitable place for a camp lower down they might be
obliged to traverse considerable country.In describing this part of the continent a traveler once crumpled a
sheet of paper in his hand and tossed it on the table, saying to a
friend as he did so that that was an outline map of the northern part of
South America.There were many gorges and plateaus, but only a few spots
where aeroplanes might land with safety.After quite a long flight, during which the machines soared around
cliffs and slid into valleys and gorges, the boys found a green valley
watered by the Esmeraldas river.Here they dropped down, and the
shelter-tents were soon ready for occupancy.“I suppose,” Carl grumbled as provisions were taken from the flying
machines and brought to the vicinity of the fire, “that we’ll have to
fight thousands of kinds of crawling and creeping things before
morning!”

“Well,” Jimmie laughed, “you wouldn’t stay up there where the flying and
creeping things don’t live!”

“My private opinion,” declared Glenn, “is that we ought to spend most of
our time in the air!I wish we could sleep on the machines!”

“Where are we going, anyhow?” demanded Jimmie.“We’re going to follow the backbone of the South American continent
clear to Cape Horn!” replied Ben.“That is, if our flying machines and
our tempers hold out!”

“I have an idea,” Glenn said, “that we’ll spend most of the time in
Peru, which is probably the oldest country in the world so far as
civilization is concerned.”

“That’s another dream!” exclaimed Carl.“Look here,” Glenn exclaimed, “there are still temples and palaces in
Peru which date back beyond the remotest reach of tradition.The
earliest Incas believed that many of the fortresses, castles and temples
which they found there were formed by the gods when the world was made.”

“That’s going back a long ways!” laughed Jimmie.“There’s a lake in Peru called Titicaca on an island in the middle of
which lies an ancient palace and many other structures,” Glenn went on.“Gathered about it are the remains of a civilization that was old when
the people of Europe consisted of a group of semi-heathen tribes
wandering from place to place.There are palaces surpassing anything to
be seen on the Rhine, and castles which had fallen into decay before
civilization began at the mouth of the Nile.”

“Go to it!” laughed Carl.“Make it good and old while you’re about it!”

“On the island of Titicaca,” continued Glenn, “are marvels in
architecture which make the wonders of Egypt look like thirty cents!There are massive fortifications perched on the sides of almost
perpendicular cliffs, and even to-day there are large stones carefully
balanced on the verge of precipices, ready to be pushed off at a
moment’s notice and sent crashing down on the legions of an attacking
foe.”

“Those old fellows must have been fighters!” commented Ben.“They were fighters, all right!” Glenn went on.“They ruled all that
part of the world until the Spaniards came.They were very
superstitious, the sun being an object of worship.The Temple of the
Sun, on the island of Titicaca, was one of the most magnificent
structures ever erected.Outside and inside the walls were lined with
gold and precious stones.The temple was the pride of the Incas, but it
was stripped of its rich covering by the Spaniards.The walls were torn
down and rifled, and the sacred sun was seized and gambled for by the
covetous invaders.Nothing that could be converted into money was
overlooked.And since that time the Incas have become one of the lowest
races on the face of the earth.”

“I suppose we shall be able to inspect a lot of these old temples?”
asked Carl.“Undoubtedly!” Glenn answered.“Some of them are deserted; some are
occupied by native Indians, and some are said to be frequented by the
spirits of those who erected them.”

“Gee!That sounds good to me!” exclaimed Jimmie.“A haunted temple might help some!” Carl exclaimed.“There really is a temple down on Lake Titicaca!” declared Glenn, “which
even Europeans declare to be inhabited by the Evil One.”

“That’s where I’m headed for!” declared Jimmie.“Any old time you show
me a mystery you’ll see me on the job!”

“There’s a mystery there, all right!” Glenn insisted.“The temple stands
on a winding arm of the lake, and is entirely surrounded by broken
country.So difficult is it of access that for years no one attempted to
visit it.Then, a few years ago, a party of Englishmen made their way to
the ruins and found themselves in an atmosphere of mystery almost
resembling magic.”

“What did they see?” asked Ben.“I don’t remember exactly what they all saw,” Glenn answered.Some saw figures in white—the long flowing robes
of priests—some saw strange lights suspended in the air; some heard the
most mournful and terrifying sounds.”

“And these Englishmen were supposed to be people of average
intelligence?” asked Ben.“There were scientists in the party!” was the reply.“There is no such word as ghost in the dictionary of the scientist!”
laughed Carl.“Following the stories told by the visitors,” Glenn went on, “a number
of people visited the vicinity of the temple, and all came away with
tales more vivid and more imaginative than those of the scientists.For
two years now the place has been left entirely alone.”

“We might go there and camp!” suggested Carl.“I move we take a look at it!” Jimmie cut in.“We can fly down on the
roof and get away before the goblins get us.”

“I’m game for anything you boys decide on,” Glenn declared, “but my
private opinion is that it will be only a waste of time for us to pay
much attention to the haunted temple!”

“The ghosts wouldn’t like us if we should leave their country without
making a formal call!” laughed Carl.“Who’s going to get supper?” asked Jimmie in a moment.“I feel like I
could eat one of the wild beasts which are said to flourish in this
region!”

“There isn’t much supper to get!” replied Ben, with, a laugh.“All we
have is a couple of pounds of ham, a few eggs, and a lot of tinned
provisions.Why don’t one of you boys go
and catch a fish?”

“Aw, I don’t believe there’s any fish in that river!” grinned Jimmie.“If there are fish there, they’ll be tough eating for they must be
acrobats!”

“Why acrobats?” asked Glenn.“Because they must stand on their heads and turn handsprings in order to
get something to eat in that swift water!”

“I believe we can get a fish for supper, just the same!” insisted Carl,
“and I’m going to get out a line and an imitation minnow and go try!”

“May the luck of the hungry fisherman go with you!” laughed Ben.“He’ll have better company than that!” Jimmie grinned.“I’m going along
myself!”

While Glenn and Ben arranged the camp for the night Jimmie and Carl
started away down the <DW72> leading to the river.Directly in front of
the tents the bank was clear of undergrowth, and covered with grass
almost waist high.Lower down, however, to the west, was a great thicket
which seemed to extend for miles.The opposite shore of the stream was
heavily wooded for some distance up.Above, the timber line showed the
bare, brown <DW72>s of mountains.When the two boys reached the bank of the stream the prospects were not
attractive, the water being broken into rapids and falls by jagged rocks
which occupied the bed of the river at this point.To the west, however,
where the stream entered the forest, the surface of the water appeared
to be unbroken, so the lads made their way in that direction.In a few
minutes their lines were out and almost instantly sharp twitches at the
hooks informed the boys that they were not fishing in barren waters.But before the first fish was landed an exciting interruption occurred.WHAT THE FISHERMEN CAUGHT.Seated with his back to the thicket, Jimmie heard a rustle and turned
about expecting to see one of his chums.Instead, he saw the ugly, vicious face of an Ecuadorian savage.While he
looked, the fellow was joined by another, equally repulsive and equally
naked.During that first moment of amazement Jimmie dropped his fish
pole and it went bobbing down the river.“Carl!” he said, in a low whisper.The boy shouted back from lower down the stream.“Got a fish?”

“Come up and see!” cried Jimmie.Carl came panting through the undergrowth, and Jimmie pointed with a
hand which was not quite steady at the two figures in the underbrush
just back of him.“Look what I’ve found!” he whispered.“Did you call me up to give me my share?” asked Carl.“If you did, I
don’t want it!You’re welcome to everything you find in that line!”

“Gee!” Jimmie exclaimed.“I wish we were back by the machines!”

“I wish so, too!” Carl put in.“I wonder why they stand there looking at
us in that way.”

“Maybe they’re out after supper, too!” remarked Jimmie.“Do they eat folks?” asked Carl.“The savages who come over from the Amazon valley eat folks,” Jimmie
answered, “and those fellows look as if they came from that
neighborhood.”

“Let’s start on up toward camp and see if they will interfere!”
suggested Carl.“Have you got a gun with you?” asked Jimmie.“Of course not!” was the reply.“I didn’t come out to shoot fish!”

“And I left mine at the camp, too!” Jimmie complained.“I’ll never do it
again!”

“Well, let’s make a start and see what comes of it!” suggested Carl.As the boys moved away the savages, men of medium height but apparently
very strong and supple, lifted naked arms in gestures which commanded
them to remain where they were.“I wonder if they’ve got guns?” questioned Jimmie.“They’ve got little short spears!” answered Carl.“I saw one in that
fellow’s hand.”

“And I suppose they’re poisoned, too!” Jimmie asserted.The two savages now advanced from the thicket and stood threateningly
before the two boys.Except for breech-clouts, which seemed to be woven
of some sort of fiber, the men were naked.In color they were almost as
dark as the <DW64> of Africa.Their features seemed to be a cross between
the tribes of Asia and Africa.They were armed with short spears which
they flourished with many hostile gestures.“Good-evening!” Jimmie said.The savages conversed together in a dialect which seemed to the boys to
resemble a confidential conversation between two hogs, and then pointed
down the river.“Here’s where we get abducted!” Carl exclaimed.“You needn’t get funny about it!” Jimmie expostulated.“This is no
joke!”

“Anyhow,” Carl went on, “the ginks don’t know anything about good
manners.They never answered your salutation!”

The savages were still uttering what appeared to be wordless commands,
and, as they continued to point down the river, very reluctantly the
boys started in that direction.“I wonder if the brutes have captured the camp, too?” queried Jimmie.“Oh, I suppose so!” Carl answered.“These fellows travel in droves, like
wild hogs, and I guess we lit right in the middle of a large tribe.”

In spite of the impatience expressed by the gestures of their captors,
the boys proceeded very slowly.As they walked they listened for some
indication of trouble at the camp.They knew that Glenn and Ben were
well armed, and that they would not submit to capture without first
putting up a spirited defence.“We haven’t heard any shooting yet,” Jimmie said in a moment.“I don’t believe there’s any use of our being lugged off in this style!”
Carl advised.“We ought to be able to break away from these brutes and
get back to camp.The boys there are all right up to this time, for we
haven’t heard any fighting, and the four of us ought to be able to
induce these two savages to beat it!”

“If we can only get back to the flying machines,” Jimmie suggested, “we
can get away, all right.I believe these fellows would drop dead if they
saw the _Louise_ or the _Bertha_ slanting up into the air!”

“Well, then, let’s make a break!” Carl advised.“All right!” Jimmie replied.“When we get to the next jungle where the
bushes are so thick they can’t throw a spear very far, you duck one way
and I’ll duck the other, and we’ll both make for the camp.”

The boys knew very well that they were in a perilous situation.The
savages were more familiar with travel through underbrush than
themselves.Besides, they would undoubtedly be able to make better time
than boys reared on city streets.In addition to all this, the spears
they carried might carry death on every tip.However, to remain seemed fully as dangerous as to attempt to escape.So
when they came to a particularly dense bit of jungle the boys darted
away.As they did so Jimmie felt a spear whiz within an inch of his
head, and Carl felt the push of one as it entered his sleeve.Dodging
swiftly this way and that, uttering cries designed to bring their chums
to their assistance, the boys forced their way through the undergrowth
some distance in advance of their pursuers.Every moment they expected to feel the sting of a spear, or to be seized
from behind by a brown, muscular hand.After all it was their voices and
not their ability as runners which brought about their rescue.Hearing the cries of their chums, Ben and Glenn sprang for their guns
and, walking swiftly toward the river, began firing, both for the
purpose of directing the boys toward the camp and with the added purpose
of frightening away any hostile element, either human or animal, walking
on four legs or on two.Panting, and scarcely believing in their own
good fortune, Jimmie and Carl presently came to where their chums stood
not far from the machines.Both boys dropped down in the long grass the
instant they felt themselves under the protection of the automatics in
the hands of their friends.To say that Glenn and Ben were surprised at the sudden appearance of
their chums only feebly expresses the situation.The savages had not
followed the boys into the open plaza where the grass grew, and so there
was no physical explanation of the incident.“What’s doing?” demanded Glenn.“You must be running for exercise!” Ben put in.“For the love of Mike!” exclaimed Jimmie, panting and holding his hands
to his sides.“Get back to the machines and throw the truck on board!These woods are full of head-hunters!”

“What did you see?” asked Ben.“Savages!” answered Jimmie.“They got us, too!” Carl put in.“They did?” demanded Glenn.“Then how did you get away?”

“Ran away!” answered Jimmie scornfully.“You don’t suppose we flew, do
you?I guess we’ve been going some!”

“Where are the savages now?” demanded Glenn.“I don’t know!” Jimmie answered.“I don’t want to know where they are.I
want to know where they ain’t!”

“Come on!” Carl urged.“Let’s get back to the machines!”

Glenn and Ben did not seem to take the incident as seriously as did
their chums.In fact, they were rather inclined to make facetious
remarks about little boys being frightened at black men in the woods.Ben was even in favor of advancing into the thicket on a tour of
investigation, but Jimmie argued him out of the idea.“They’re savages, all right!” the latter insisted.“They’re naked, and
they’re armed with spears.Look to me like head-hunters from the Amazon
valley!If you go into the thicket you’re likely to get a couple of
spears into your frame!”

“Then I won’t go!” Ben grinned.“Come on,” urged Carl, “it’s getting dark, so we’d better be getting
back to camp!Perhaps the <DW65>s have beaten us to it already!”

“I guess the two you saw are about the only ones in the vicinity,”
answered Glenn.“You’d feel pretty cheap, wouldn’t you, if you’d get back to camp and
find that the savages had taken possession?” demanded Jimmie.Thus urged, Glenn and Ben finally abandoned the idea of advancing into
the forest.Instead, they turned their faces toward the camp, and all
four boys advanced with ever-increasing speed as they neared the spot
where the aeroplanes and the tents had been left.About the first thing they saw as they came within sight of the broad
planes of the flying machines was a naked savage inspecting the motors.He stood like a statue before the machine for an instant and then glided
away.They saw him turn about as he came to a cluster of underbrush,
beckon silently to some one, apparently on the other side of the camp,
and then disappear.“And that means,” Glenn whispered, “that the woods are full of ’em!”

“Oh, no,” jeered Jimmie, “the two we saw are the only ones there are in
the woods!I guess you’ll think there is something in the story we told
about being captured and abducted!”

The short tropical twilight had now entirely passed away.It seemed to
the boys as if a curtain had been drawn between themselves and the tents
and flying machines which had been so plainly in view a moment before.There was only the glimmer of the small camp-fire to direct them to
their camp.“Who’s got a searchlight?” asked Glenn.“I have!” replied Ben.“I never leave the camp without one!”

“Then use it!” advised Glenn, “and we will make for the machines.”

“Don’t you do it!” advised Jimmie.“They’ll throw spears at us!”

“Well, we’ve got to have a light in order to get the machines away!”
declared Carl.“Perhaps the <DW65>s will run when they see the
illumination.The light of a searchlight at a distance, you know,
doesn’t look like anything human or divine!”

It was finally decided to advance as cautiously and silently as possible
to the camp and spring at once to the machines.“We’ll never be clear of these savages until we get up in the air!”
declared Ben.“But that will leave our tents and our provisions, and about everything
we have except the machines, behind!” wailed Carl.“It won’t leave all the provisions behind!” declared Jimmie.“I’ll
snatch beans and bread if I get killed doing it!”

During their progress to the camp the boys neither saw nor heard
anything whatever of the savages.They found the fire burning brightly
and the provisions which had been set out for supper just as they had
been left.In fact, the statue-like
savage they had observed examining the flying machine now seemed to have
come out of a dream and retreated to his world of shadows again.“Perhaps it won’t be necessary to leave here to-night,” Glenn suggested.“I don’t think it’s safe to remain,” Ben contended.“You boys may stay if you want to!” Jimmie exclaimed.“But Carl and I
have had enough of this neck of the woods.We’ll take the _Louise_ and
fly over to Quito, and you can find us there when you get ready to move
on.You boys certainly take the cake for not knowing what’s good for
you!” he added with a grin.“Oh, well, perhaps we’d all better go!” Glenn advised.“I don’t see
anything nourishing in this part of the country, anyway.If you boys had
only brought home a couple of fish it might have been different.I’m of
the opinion that a square meal at Quito wouldn’t come amiss just now.”

“It’s so blooming dark I don’t know whether we can find the town or
not,” suggested Carl.“Oh, we can find it all right!” insisted Ben.“If the savages let us!” exclaimed Jimmie excitedly.“I don’t see any savages!” replied Glenn.“Can’t you hear them?” demanded Jimmie.“I think I can smell something!” Carl exclaimed.“Don’t get gay, now!” Jimmie answered.If
you’ll listen, you’ll hear the snakes creeping through the grass.”

The boys listened intently for an instant and then, without looking into
the tents, sprang toward the machines.It seemed for a moment as if a
thousand voices were shouting at them.They seemed to be in the center
of a circle of men who were all practicing a different style of
war-whoop.To this day the boys assert that it was the whirling of the electric
searchlights which kept the savages from advancing upon them.At any
rate, for a time, the unseen visitors contented themselves with verbal
demonstrations.“We’ll have to jump out on the machines!” advised Glenn.“We can’t fight
a whole army!”

“Why, there’s only two!” Jimmie taunted.“You said yourself that we saw
all the black men there were in this neighborhood!”

“Aw, keep still,” Ben cried.“We haven’t got time to listen to you boys
joke each other!You and I for the _Louise_!”

It was now very dark, for banks of clouds lay low in the valley, but the
boys knew that the machines were situated so as to run smoothly until
the propellers and the planes brought them into the air.With a chorus of savage yells still ringing in their ears, the boys
leaped into their seats, still swinging their searchlights frantically
as their only means of protection, and pressed the starters.The
machines ran ahead smoothly for an instant then lifted.The boys were certain
that if they could have looked down upon the savages who had been so
threatening a moment before they would have seen them on their knees
with their faces pressed to the ground.“They’ll talk about this night for a thousand years!” Jimmie screamed in
Ben’s ear as the _Louise_ swept into and through a stratum of cloud.“They’ll send it down to future generations in legends of magic.”

“Little do we care what they think of us after we get out of their
clutches!” Ben called back.“It seems like a miracle, our getting away
at all!”

“Do you really think they are head-hunters?” shouted Jimmie.“You saw more of them than I did,” Ben answered.After passing through the clouds the starlight showed the way, and in a
very short time the lights of Quito were seen glittering twenty miles or
so to the south.“What are we going to do when we get to the town?” shouted Jimmie.“Hire some one to watch the machines and get a square meal!” Ben
replied.“And buy new tents and provisions and everything of that kind!”
he went on.“I suppose those savages will have a fine time devouring our
perfectly good food.”

“And they’ll probably use the oiled-silk tents for clothing!” laughed
Jimmie.“I wonder if we can buy more at Quito.”

“Of course we can!” replied Ben.“Quito has a hundred thousand
inhabitants, and there are plenty of European places of business there!”

The _Bertha_ with Glenn and Carl on board was some distance in advance,
and directly the boys on the _Louise_ saw the leading machine swing
about in a circle and then gradually drop to the ground.Ben, who was
driving the _Louise_, adopted the same tactics, and very soon the two
flying machines lay together in an open field, perhaps a mile distant
from Quito, the capital of Ecuador, the city known throughout the world
as the “City of Eternal Spring.”

It was dark at the ground level, there being only the light of the
stars, faintly seen through drifting masses of clouds, many hundred feet
higher here than those which had nestled over the valley.“What next?” asked Carl as the four boys leaped from their seats and
gathered in a little group.“Supper next!” shouted Jimmie.“But we can’t all leave the machines!” declared Glenn.“Don’t you ever worry about the machines being left alone!” asserted
Ben.“Our lights will bring about a thousand people out here within the
next ten minutes.Dark as it is, our machines were undoubtedly seen
before we landed, and there’ll soon be an army here asking questions.We’ll have little trouble in finding English-speaking people in the
mob.”

“I guess that’s right!” Jimmie agreed.“Here comes the gang right now!”

A jumble of English, Spanish and French was now heard, and directly a
dozen or more figures were seen advancing across the field to where the
flying machines had landed.“There’s some one talking United States, all right!” Jimmie declared.Directly the visitors came up to where the boys were standing and began
gazing about, some impudently, some curiously and some threateningly.“Keep your hands off the machines!” Glenn warned, as a dusky native
began handling the levers.The fellow turned about and regarded the boy with an impudent stare.He
said something in Spanish which Glenn did not understand, and then
walked away to a group of natives who were whispering suspiciously
together.“Where are you from?” asked a voice in English as Glenn examined the
levers to see that nothing had been removed or displaced.“Gee!” exclaimed Jimmie.“That United States talk sounds good to me!”

The man who had spoken now turned to Jimmie and repeated his question.“Where do you boys come from?”

“New York,” Jimmie replied.“And you came across the Isthmus of Panama?” was the next question.“Sure we did!” answered the boy.“Well,” the stranger said, “my name is Bixby, Jim Bixby, and I’ve been
looking for you for two days.”

“Is that so?” asked Jimmie incredulously.“You see,” Bixby went on, “I am a dealer in automobile supplies,
probably the only one doing a large business in this part of the
country.Some days ago I received a telegram from Louis Havens, the
millionaire aviator, saying that four pupils of his were coming this
way, and advising me to take good care of you.”

“Where did Mr.Havens wire from?” asked Jimmie.“First from New York,” was the reply, “and then from New Orleans.It
seems that he started away from New York on the day following your
departure, and that he has been having trouble with the _Ann_ all the
way down.His last telegram instructed me to ask you to wait here until
his arrival.He ought to be here sometime to-morrow.”

“That’ll be fine!” exclaimed Jimmie.“And now,” Bixby went on, “you’ll have to employ two or three fellows to
watch your machines for the night.The natives would carry them away
piecemeal if you left them here unguarded.”

“Perhaps you can pick out two or three trusty men,” suggested Glenn.“I have had three men in mind ever since I received my first message
from Mr.Havens!” replied Bixby.“When your machine was sighted in the
air not long ago, I ’phoned to their houses and they will undoubtedly be
here before long.”

“How’ll they know where to come?” asked Jimmie.“Don’t you think that half the people in Quito don’t know where these
wonders of the air lighted!” Bixby laughed.“The news went over the city
like lightning when your planes showed.Your lights, of course, revealed
your exact whereabouts to those on this side of the town, and telephones
and messenger boys have done the rest.”

While the boys talked with this very welcome and friendly visitor, the
clamor of an automobile was heard, and directly two great acetylene eyes
left the highway and turned, bumping and swaying, into the field.“There will be damages to pay for mussing up this grass!” Carl
suggested, as a fresh crowd of sight-seers followed the machine into the
enclosure.“Of course,” replied Bixby, “and they’ll try to make you pay ten times
what the damage really amounts to.I can
handle these fellows better than you can!”

“We shall be glad to have you do so!” Glenn replied.In a moment the automobile ran up to the planes and stopped.Of the four
men it contained, three alighted and approached Bixby.“These are the guards,” the latter said turning to the boys.The men, who seemed both willing and efficient, drew a long rope and
several steel stakes from the automobile and began enclosing the
machines with the same.As the rope was strung out, the constantly
increasing crowd was pushed back beyond the circle.“Won’t they make trouble for the guards during the night?” asked Ben.“I think not,” was the reply.“I have already arranged for a number of
native policemen to assist these men.”

“Gee!” exclaimed Carl, “I guess Mr.Havens picked out the right man!”

“How did he know we were going to stop at Quito?” asked Ben.“He didn’t know!” replied Bixby.“But he surmised that you’d be obliged
to land here in order to fill your fuel tanks.”

“Well, we didn’t come here for that purpose,” laughed Glenn.“We came
here because the savages chased us out of a cute little valley about
twenty miles away!”

“It’s a wonder you got away at all if they saw you!” said Bixby.“I guess they didn’t seem to understand about our motors getting into
the air!” laughed Jimmie.“The minute the wheel left the ground their
war-cries ceased.”

“It’s a wonder you were permitted to get to the machines at all if they
caught you away from them!” said Bixby.“Aw, we always have the luck of the Irish,” Jimmie replied.“The
shooting and the display of electric searchlights kept them away until
we got into the seats and our way of ascending into the sky did the
rest.”

“You are very lucky boys!” insisted Bixby.“It’s nice to hear you say so!” Ben answered, “because we’re going to
follow this line of mountains down to Cape Horn, and visit every ruined
temple on the route that has a ghost on its visiting list.”

“If you’ll listen to the stories you hear in the cities,” laughed Bixby,
“you’ll visit a good many ruined temples.”

“Glenn was telling us about a temple down on Lake Titicaca,” Ben
replied.“He says that figures in flowing white robes appear in the
night-time, and are seen by the light that emanates from their own
figures!He says, too, that there are illuminations of red, and green,
and yellow, which come from no determinable source, and that there are
noises which come out of the clear air unaccounted for!”

“There is such a temple, isn’t there, Mr.“There is a temple about which such stories are told,” laughed Bixby.“Are you boys thinking of going there?”

“Sure thing, we’re going there!” asserted Jimmie.During this conversation the three men who had been employed by Bixby to
guard the flying machine during the night had been standing by in
listening attitudes.When the haunted temple and the proposed visit of
the boys to it was mentioned, one of them whose name had been given as
Doran, touched Jimmie lightly on the shoulder.“Are you really going to that haunted temple?” he asked.Jimmie nodded, and in a short time the four boys and Bixby left for the
city in the automobile.As they entered the machine Jimmie thought that
he caught a hostile expression on Doran’s face, but the impression was
so faint that he said nothing of the matter to his chums.In an hour’s time Bixby and the four boys were seated at dinner in the
dining-room of a hotel which might have been on Broadway, so perfect
were its appointments.“Now let me give you a little advice,” Bixby said, after the incidents
of the journey had been discussed.“Never talk about prospective visits
to ruined temples in South America.There is a general belief that every
person who visits a ruin is in quest of gold, and many a man who set out
to gratify his own curiosity has never been heard of again!”




                              CHAPTER IV.PLANNING A MIDNIGHT RIDE.“If the people of the country believe there is gold in the temples said
to be haunted,” Glenn asked, “why don’t they hunt for it themselves,
without waiting for others to come down and give them a tip?”

“Generally speaking,” replied Bixby, “every ruin in Peru has been
searched time and again by natives.Millions of treasure has been found,
but there is still the notion, which seems to have been born into every
native of South America, that untold stores of gold, silver and precious
stones are still concealed in the ruined temples.”

“What I can’t understand is this,” Glenn declared.“Why should these
natives, having every facility for investigation, follow the lead of
strangers who come here mostly for pleasure?”

“I can’t understand that part of it myself,” Bixby replied, “except on
the theory that the natives ascribe supernatural powers to foreigners.Even the most intelligent natives who do not believe in the magic of
Europeans, watch them closely when they visit ruins, doubtless on the
theory that in some way the visitors have become posted as to the
location of treasure.”

“Well,” Ben observed, “they can’t make much trouble for us, because we
can light down on a temple, run through it before the natives can get
within speaking distance, and fly away again.”

“All the same,” Bixby insisted, “I wouldn’t talk very much about
visiting ruins of any kind.And here’s another thing,” he went on,
“there are stories afloat in Peru that fugitives from justice sometimes
hide in these ruins.And so, you see,” he added with a laugh, “you are
likely to place yourself in bad company in the minds of the natives by
being too inquisitive about the methods of the ancient Incas.”

“All right,” Glenn finally promised, “we’ll be careful about mentioning
ruins in the future.”

After dinner the boys went to Bixby’s place of business and ordered
gasoline enough to fill the tanks.They also ordered an extra supply of
gasoline, which was to be stored in an auxiliary container of rubber
made for that purpose.“Now about tents and provisions?” asked Bixby.“Confound those savages!” exclaimed Jimmie.“We carried those oiled-silk
shelter-tents safely through two long journeys in the mountains of
California and Mexico, and now we have to turn them over to a lot of
savages in Ecuador!I believe we could have frightened the brutes away
by doing a little shooting!Anyway, I wish we’d tried it!”

“Not for mine!” exclaimed Carl.“I don’t want to go through the country
killing people, even if they are South American savages.”

“I may be able to get you a supply of oiled-silk in Quito,” Bixby
suggested, “but I am not certain.It is very expensive, you understand,
of course, and rather scarce.”

“The expense is all right,” replied Glenn, “but we felt a sort of
sentimental attachment for those old shelter-tents.We can get all the
provisions we need here, of course?” he added.“Certainly,” was the reply.“Look here!” Jimmie cut in.“What time will there be a moon to-night?”

“Probably about one o’clock,” was the reply.“By that time, however, you
ought all to be sound asleep in your beds.”

“What’s the idea, Jimmie?” asked Carl.The boys all saw by the quickening expressions in the two boys’ faces
that they had arrived at an understanding as to the importance of
moonlight on that particular night.“Why, I thought—” began Jimmie.“I just thought it might not do any harm
to run back to that peaceful little glade to see if the tents really
have been removed or destroyed!”

“Impossible!” advised Bixby.“The tents may remain just where you left
them, but, even if they are there, you may have no chance of securing
them.It is a risky proposition!”

“What do you mean?” asked Ben.“I mean that the superstition of the savages may restrain them from
laying hands on the tents and provisions you left,” replied Bixby, “but,
at the same time,” he continued, “they may watch the old camp for days
in the hope of your return.”

“What’s the idea?” asked Glenn.“Do they want to eat us?” asked Jimmie.“Some of the wild tribes living near the head waters of the Amazon,”
Bixby explained, “are crazy over the capture of white men.They are said
to march them back to their own country in state, and to inaugurate long
festivals in honor of the victory.And during the entire festival,”
Bixby went on, “the white prisoners are subjected to tortures of the
most brutal description!”

“Say,” giggled Jimmie, giving Carl a dig in the ribs with his elbow,
“let’s take the train for Guayaquil to-morrow morning!I don’t think
it’s right for us to take chances on the savages having all the fun!”

“As between taking the first train for Guayaquil and taking a trip
through the air to the old camp to-night,” Bixby laughed, “I certainly
advise in favor of the former.”

“Aw, that’s all talk,” Ben explained, as Bixby, after promising to look
about in the morning for oiled-silk and provisions, locked his place of
business and started toward the hotel with the boys.“What do you say to it, Carl?” Jimmie asked, as the two fell in behind
the others.“I’m game!” replied Carl.“Then I’ll tell you what we’ll do!” Jimmie explained.“You and I will
get a room together and remain up until moonrise.If the sky is clear of
clouds at that time, and promises to remain so until morning, we’ll load
ourselves down with all the guns we can get hold of and fly out to the
old camp.It’ll be a fine ride, anyway!”

“Pretty chilly, though, in high altitudes at this time of night,”
suggested Carl.“I’m most frozen now!”

“So’m I,” Jimmie replied, “and I’ll tell you what we’ll do!When we
start away we’ll swipe blankets off the bed.I guess they’ll keep us
warm.”

“Well, we’ll have to keep Glenn and Ben from knowing anything about the
old trip,” Carl suggested.“Of course they couldn’t prevent us going,
but they’d put up a kick that would make it unpleasant.”

“Indeed they would!” answered Jimmie.“But, at the same time, they’d go
themselves if they’d got hold of the idea first.I suggested it, you
know, and that’s one reason why they would reject it.”

Arrived at the hotel, Jimmie and Carl had no difficulty in getting a
double room, although their chums looked rather suspiciously at them as
they all entered the elevator.“Now,” said Ben, “don’t you boys get into any mischief to-night.Quito
isn’t a town for foreigners to explore during the dark hours!”

“I’m too sleepy to think of any midnight adventures!” cried Jimmie with
a wink and a yawn.“Me, too!” declared Carl.“I’ll be asleep in about two minutes!”

It was about ten o’clock when the boys found themselves alone in a large
room which faced one of the leading thoroughfares of the capital city.Quito is well lighted by electricity, and nearly all the conveniences of
a city of the same size in the United States are there to be had.The street below the room occupied by the two boys was brilliantly
lighted until midnight, and the lads sat at a window looking out on the
strange and to them unusual scene.When the lights which flashed from
business signs and private offices were extinguished, the thoroughfare
grew darker, and then the boys began seriously to plan their proposed
excursion.“What we want to do,” Jimmie suggested, “is to get out of the hotel
without being discovered and make our way to a back street where a cab
can be ordered.It is a mile to the field where the machines were left,
and we don’t want to lose any time.”

Before leaving the room the boys saw that their automatic revolvers and
searchlights were in good order.They also made neat packages of the
woolen blankets which they found on the bed and carried them away.“Now,” said Jimmie as they reached a side street and passed swiftly
along in the shadow of a row of tall buildings, “we’ve got to get into a
cab without attracting any attention, for we’ve stolen the hotel’s
blankets, and we can’t talk Spanish, and if a cop should seize us we’d
have a good many explanations to make.”

“I don’t think it’s good sense to take the blankets,” Carl objected.“Aw, you’ll think so when we get a couple of thousand feet up in the air
on the _Louise_!” laughed Jimmie.After walking perhaps ten minutes, the boys came upon a creaking old cab
drawn by a couple of the sorriest-looking horses they had ever seen.The
driver, who sat half asleep on the seat, jumped down to the pavement and
eyed the boys suspiciously as they requested to be taken out to where
the machines had been left.The lads were expecting a long tussle between the English and the
Spanish languages, but the cabman surprised them by answering their
request in excellent English.“So?” exclaimed Jimmie.“You talk United States, too, do you?Where did
you come from?”

“You want to go out to the machines, do you?” asked the cabman, without
appearing to notice the question.“That’s where we want to go!” replied Carl.“What for?” asked the cabman.“None of your business!” replied Jimmie.“I’ve been out there once to-night!” said the cabman, “and the party I
drew beat me out of my fare.”

“That’s got nothing to do with us!” replied Carl.“It’ll cost you ten dollars!” growled the cabman.“Say, look here!” Jimmie exclaimed.“You’re a bigger robber than the New
York cabmen!It’s only a mile to the field, and we’ll walk just to show
you that we don’t have to use your rickety old cab.”

With a snarl and a frown the cabman climbed back up on his seat and gave
every appearance of dropping into sound slumber.“Now what do you think of that for a thief?” asked Carl, as the boys
hastened away toward the field.“I’d walk ten miles before I’d give that
fellow a quarter!”

“We’ve got plenty of time,” Jimmie answered.“The moon won’t be up for
an hour yet.Perhaps we’d better walk up anyway, for then we can enter
the field quietly and see what’s going on.”

On the way out the lads met several parties returning from the field,
and when they reached the opening in the fence they saw that many
curious persons were still present.There were at least half a dozen
vehicles of different kinds gathered close about the roped-off circle.“Say,” Carl exclaimed as the boys passed into the field, “look at that
old rattletrap on the right.Isn’t that the same vehicle the cabman
pretended to go asleep on as we came away?”

“Sure it is!” answered Jimmie.“I don’t remember the appearance of the
cab so well, but I know just how the horses looked.”

“He must have found a ten-dollar fare out here!” Carl suggested.“Yes, and he must have come out by a roundabout way in order to prevent
our seeing him.Now what do you think he did that for?Why should he
care whether we see him or not?”

As the boy asked the question the rig which they had been discussing was
driven slowly away, not in the direction of the road, but toward the
back end of the field.“Something mighty funny going on here!” Jimmie declared.“I guess it’s a
good thing we came out.”

When the boys came up to where the machines were lying, Doran was the
first one to approach.“Little nervous about your machines, eh?” he asked.“Rather,” replied Jimmie.“We came out with the idea of taking a short
trip to see if they still are in working order.”

“Well,” Doran said with a scowl, “of course you know that you can’t take
the machines out without an order from Mr.Bixby!”




                               CHAPTER V.

                          A WAIF AND A STRAY.“Bixby doesn’t own these machines!” exclaimed Carl angrily.“Who does own them?” demanded Doran.“We four boys own them!” was the reply.“Well, you’ve got to show me!” insisted Doran, insolently.“I’ll tell you what we’ll do!” Jimmie announced.“We’ll go right back to
Bixby and put you off the job!”

“Go as far as you like,” answered Doran.“I was put here to guard these
machines and I intend to do it.You can’t bluff me!”

While the boys stood talking with the impertinent guard they saw two
figures moving stealthily about the aeroplanes.Jimmie hastened over to
the _Louise_ and saw a man fumbling in the tool-box.“What are you doing here?” demanded the boy.The intruder turned a startled face for an instant and then darted away,
taking the direction the cab had taken.Carl and Doran now came running up and Jimmie turned to the latter.“Nice old guard you are!” he almost shouted.“Here you stand talking
with us while men are sneaking around the machines!”

“Was there some one here?” asked Doran in assumed amazement.“There surely was!” replied Jimmie.“Where are the other guards?”

“Why,” replied Doran hesitatingly, “they got tired of standing around
doing nothing and went home.It’s pretty dull out here.”

“Well,” Jimmie answered, “I’m going to see if this machine has been
tampered with!Get up on one of the seats, Carl,” he said with a wink,
“and we’ll soon find out if any of the fastenings have been loosened.”

The boy was permitted to follow instructions without any opposition or
comment from Doran, and in a moment Jimmie was in the other seat with
the wheels in motion.Seeing too late the trick which had been played upon him, Doran uttered
an exclamation of anger and sprang for one of the planes.His fingers
just scraped the edge of the wing as the machine, gathering momentum
every instant, lifted from the ground, and he fell flat.He arose instantly to shake a threatening fist at the disappearing
aeroplane.Jimmie turned back with a grin on his freckled face.“Catch on behind,” he said, “and I’ll give you a ride!”

“Did you see some one fumbling around the machine?” asked Carl, as
Jimmie slowed the motors down a trifle in order to give a chance for
conversation.“Sure, I did!” was the reply.“He ducked away when he saw me coming, and
ran away into the field in the direction taken by the cab.”

“Gee!” exclaimed Carl.“Do you think the cabman brought that man out to
work some mischief with the flying machines?”

“I don’t think much about it,” Jimmie answered, “because I don’t know
much about it!He might have done something to the machine which will
cause us to take a drop in the air directly, but I don’t think so.Anyhow, it’s running smoothly now.”

“Still we’re taking chances!” insisted Carl.The moon now stood well up in the eastern sky, a round, red ball of fire
which looked to the lads large enough to shadow half the sky a little
later on.Below, the surface of the earth was clearly revealed in its
light.“We’ll have to hurry!” Carl suggested, “if we get back to the hotel
before daylight, so I’ll quit talking and you turn on more power.”

“I may not be able to find this blooming old valley where we left the
tents,” Jimmie grumbled.“If you remember, son, we left that locality in
something of a hurry!”

“I certainly remember something which looked to me like a jungle scene
in a comic opera!” grinned Carl.“And the noise sounded not unlike some
of the choruses I have heard in little old New York!”

Jimmie drove straight north for an hour, and then began circling to left
and right in search of the little valley from which they had fled so
precipitously.At last the gleam of running water caught his eyes and he
began volplaning down.“Are you sure that’s the place?” asked Carl, almost screaming the words
into Jimmie’s ears.“I don’t see any tents down there, do you?”

“I see something that looks like a tent,” Jimmie answered.“We are so
high up now that we couldn’t distinguish one of them anyhow.”

As the aeroplane drove nearer to the earth, a blaze flared up from
below.In its red light they saw the two shelter-tents standing in
exactly the same position in which they had been left.“There!” cried Jimmie.“I had an idea we’d find them!”

“But look at the fire!” cautioned Carl.“There’s some one there keeping
up that blaze!”

“That’s a funny proposition, too!” exclaimed Jimmie.“It doesn’t seem as
if the savages would remain on the ground after our departure.”

“And it doesn’t seem as if they would go away without taking everything
they could carry with them, either!” laughed Carl.“We can’t guess it out up here,” Jimmie argued.“We may as well light
and find out what it means.Have your guns ready, and shoot the first
savage who comes within range.”

When the rubber-tired wheels of the machine struck the ground which they
had occupied only a short time before, the boys found a great surprise
awaiting them.As if awakened from slumber by the clatter of the motors,
a figure dressed in nondescript European costume arose from the fire,
yawning and rubbing his eyes, and advanced to meet them.It was the figure of a young man of perhaps eighteen, though the ragged
and soiled clothing he wore, the unwashed face, the long hair, made it
difficult for one to give any accurate estimate as to the years of his
life.He certainly looked like a tramp, but he came forward with an air
of assurance which could not have been improved upon by a millionaire
hotel-keeper, or a haughty three-dollar-a-week clerk in a ten-cent
store.“Je-rusalem!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Now what do you think of this?”

“I saw him first!” declared Carl.“All right, you may have him!”

The intruder came forward and stood for a moment without speaking,
regarding the boys curiously in the meantime.“Well,” Jimmie said in a moment, “what about it?”

“I thought you’d be back,” said the other.“Where are the savages?” asked Carl.“Didn’t you bump into a war party
here?”

The stranger smiled and pointed to the tents.“I am a truthful man,” he said.“I wouldn’t tell a lie for a dollar.I
might tell six for five dollars, but I wouldn’t tell one lie for any
small sum.My name is Sam Weller, and I’m a tramp.”

“That’s no lie!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Unless appearances are deceiving!”

“Perhaps,” Carl suggested, “we’d better be getting out of here.The
natives may return.”

“As soon as you have given me time to relate a chapter of my life,” Sam
Weller continued, “you’ll understand why the savages won’t be back here
to-night.”

“Go on!” Jimmie grunted.“Tell us the story of your life, beginning with
the poor but dishonest parents and the statement that you were never
understood when you were a baby!”

“This chapter of my life,” Sam went on, without seeming to notice the
interruption, “begins shortly after sunset of the evening just passed.”

“Go ahead!” Carl exclaimed.“Get a move on!”

“While walking leisurely from the Isthmus of Panama to Cape Horn,” Sam
began, “I saw your two flying machines drop down into this valley.At
that time,” he continued, “I was in need of sustenance.I am happy to
state, however,” he added with a significant look in the direction of
half a dozen empty tin cans, “that at the present moment I feel no such
need.For the present I am well supplied.”

“Holy Mackerel!” exclaimed Carl.“But you’ve got your nerve.”

“My nerve is my fortune!” replied Sam whimsically.“But, to continue my
narrative,” he went on.“It seemed to me a dispensation of providence in
my favor when you boys landed in the valley.In my mind’s eye, I saw
plenty to eat and unexceptionable companionship.You were so thoroughly
interested in landing that I thought it advisable to wait for a more
receptive mood in which to present my petition for—for—well, not to put
too fine a point upon it, as Micawber would say—for grub.”

“Say!” laughed Carl.“It’s a sure thing you’ve panhandled in every state
in the union.”

Sam smiled grimly but continued without comment.“So I hid myself back there in the tall grass and waited for you to get
supper.Don’t you see,” he went on, “that when a boy’s hungry he doesn’t
radiate that sympathy for the unfortunate which naturally comes with a
full stomach.Therefore, I waited for you boys to eat your supper before
I asked for mine.”

“You’re all right, anyhow!” shouted Jimmie.“But it seems that your meal was long-delayed,” Sam went on, with a
little shrug of disgust.“I lay there in the long grass and waited,
hoping against hope.Then in a short time
I heard cries of terror and supplication.Then your two friends rushed
out to your assistance.Then, being entirely under the influence of
hunger and not responsible for my acts, I crawled into one of the tents
and began helping myself to the provisions.”

“And you were there when the savages flocked down upon us?” asked Carl.“You saw what took place after that?”

“I was there and I saw,” was the reply.“When you boys came running back
to the machines I stood ready to defend you with my life and two
automatic revolvers which I had found while searching through the
provisions.When you sprang into the machines and slipped away, leaving
the savages still hungry, I felt that my last hour had come.However, I
clung to the guns and a can of a superior brand of beans put up at
Battle Creek, Michigan.”

“How did you come out with the Indians?” asked Carl.“Did you tell them
the story of your life?”

“Hardly!” was the laughing reply.“I appeared at the door of the tent in
a chastened mood, it is true, ready for peace or war, but when I saw the
savages lying upon their hands and elbows, faces bowed to the tall
grass, I reached the conclusion that I had them—well Buffaloed!”

“The machines did it?” asked Jimmie.“The machines did it!” replied Sam.“The Indians bowed their heads for a
long time, and then gazed in awe at the disappearing aeroplanes.As I
said a moment ago, they were Buffaloed.When they saw me standing at the
door of the tent, they looked about for another machine.So did I for a
matter of fact, for I thought I needed one just about then!”

“Can you run a machine?” asked Carl.“Sure I can run a machine!” was the reply.“I can run anything from a
railroad train to a race with a township constable.Well, when the
machines disappeared, the savages vanished.Not a thing about the camp
was touched.I appointed myself custodian, and decided to remain here
until you came back after your tents.”

“Then where are you going?” asked Carl.“With your permission, I will place three days’ provisions under my belt
and be on my way.”

“Not three days’ supplies all at once?” questioned Jimmie.“All at once!” replied Sam.The two boys consulted together for a moment, and then Jimmie said:

“If you’ll help us pack the tents and provisions on the machine, we’ll
take you back to Quito with us.That is, if the _Louise_ will carry so
much weight.I think she will, but ain’t sure.”

“It surely will be a treat to ride in the air again!” declared the
tramp.“It has been a long time since Louis Havens kicked me out of his
hangar on Long Island for getting intoxicated and filling one of the
tanks with beer instead of gasoline.”

The boys smiled at each other significantly, for they well remembered
Mr.Havens’ story of the tramp’s rather humorous experience at the Long
Island establishment.However, they said nothing to Sam of this.“And, in the meantime,” the tramp said, pointing upward, “we may as well
wait here until we ascertain what that other machine is doing in the air
at this time of night!”




                              CHAPTER VI.Shortly after midnight Ben was awakened by a noise which seemed to come
from the door of his room.Half asleep as he was, it came to his
consciousness like the sparkling of a motor.There was the same sharp
tick, tick, tick, with regular pauses between.As he sat up in bed and listened, however, the sounds resolved
themselves into the rattle of one metal against another.In a minute he
knew that some one unfamiliar with the lock of his door was moving the
stem of a key against the metal plate which surrounded the key-hole.Then he heard the bolt shoot back and the door opened.There was an
electric switch on the wall within reach of his hand, and in a second
the room was flooded with light.The person who stood in the center of
the floor, halfway between the doorway and the bed, was an entire
stranger to the boy.He was dressed in clothing which would not have
been rejected by the head waiter of one of the lobster palaces on
Broadway, and his manner was pleasing and friendly.He smiled and dropped into a chair, holding out both hands when he saw
Ben’s eyes traveling from himself to an automatic revolver which lay on
a stand at the head of the bed.“Of course,” he said, then, as Ben sat down on the edge of the bed, “you
want to know what I’m doing here.”

“Naturally!” replied the boy.The man, who appeared to be somewhere near the age of twenty-five, drew
a yellow envelope from his pocket and tossed it over to Ben.“I am manager at the Quito telegraph office!” he said.“And I received
this despatch for you just before twelve o’clock.In addition to this I
received a personal message from Mr.Read your message and then
I will show you mine!”

Ben opened the envelope and read:

“Be sure and wait for me at the point where this message is delivered.Complications which can only be explained in person!”

The manager then passed his own despatch over to the boy.It read as
follows:

“Mr.Charles Mellen, Manager: Spare no expense in the delivery of the
message to Ben Whitcomb.If necessary, wire all stations on your circuit
for information regarding aeroplanes.If Whitcomb is at Quito, kindly
deliver this message in person, and warn him to be on the watch for
trouble.I hope to reach your town within twenty-four hours.”

“Now for an explanation regarding my surreptitious entrance into your
sleeping room,” Mellen went on.“My room is next to yours, and in order
not to awaken other sleepers, and at the same time make certain that you
understood the situation thoroughly, I tried my hand at burglary.”

“I am glad you did!” replied Ben.“For if there is anything serious in
the air it is quite important that no stir be created in the hotel at
this hour of the night.”

“That was just my idea!” Mellen answered.“I knew that if I asked the
clerk to send a page to your room every person in the hotel would know
all about the midnight visit in the morning.So far as I know,
understand, the complications hinted at by Mr.Havens may have had their
origin in Quito—perhaps in this very hotel.”

“It was very thoughtful of you,” answered Ben.Havens
personally?” he asked then.“Certainly!” was the reply.“He is a heavy stock-holder in the company I
represent; and it was partly through his influence that I secured my
present position.”

“After all,” smiled Ben, “this is a small world, isn’t it?The idea of
finding a friend of a friend up near the roof of the world!”

“Yes, it’s a small world,” replied Mellen.“Now tell me this,” he went
on, “have you any idea as to what Mr.Havens refers in his two rather
mysterious messages?”

“Not the slightest!” was the reply.“I wish we knew where to find Havens at this time,” mused Mellen.“I don’t think it will be possible to reach him until he wires again,”
Ben answered, “because, unless I am greatly mistaken, he is somewhere
between New Orleans and this point in his airship, the _Ann_.”

“I gathered as much from his messages to Bixby,” replied Mellen.“You
see,” the manager went on, “I got in touch with Havens to-night through
the despatches he sent to Bixby yesterday, I say ‘yesterday’ because it
is now ‘to-morrow’,” he added with a smile.“Then you knew we were here?” asked Ben.“That is,” he corrected
himself, “you knew Bixby was expecting us?”

“When Bixby left you at the hotel,” Mellen laughed, “he came direct to
the telegraph office, so you see I knew all about it before I
burglarized your room.”

“Bixby strikes me as being a very straightforward kind of a man,” Ben
suggested.“I rather like his appearance.”

“He’s all right!” replied Mellen.“And now,” Ben continued, “I’d like to have you remain here a short time
until I can call the other boys and get a general expression of
opinion.”

“Of course you’ll wait for Mr.Havens?” suggested Mellen.“Of course,” answered Ben.“However,” he continued, “I’d like to have
the other members of the party talk this matter over with you.To tell
the truth, I’m all at sea over this suggestion of trouble.”

“I shall be pleased to meet the other members of your party,” replied
Mellen.“I have already heard something of them through my
correspondence with Mr.Havens.”

Ben drew on his clothes and hurried to Glenn’s room.The boy was awake
and opened the door at the first light knock.Ben merely told him to go
to the room where Mr.Mellen had been left and passed on to the
apartment which had been taken by Jimmie and Carl.He knocked softly on the door several times but received no answer.Believing that the boys were sound asleep he tried the door, and to his
great surprise found that it was unlocked.As the reader will understand, he found the room unoccupied.The bed had
not been disturbed except that some of the upper blankets were missing.He hastened back to his own room, where he found Glenn and Mellen
engaged in conversation.Both looked very blank when informed of the
disappearance of Jimmie and Carl.“What do you make of it?” asked Mellen.“I don’t know what to make of it!” replied Glenn.“I think I can explain it!” Ben cried, walking nervously up and down the
room.“Don’t you remember, Glenn,” he went on, “that Jimmie and Carl
suggested the advisability of going back to the old camp after moonrise
and getting the valuable tents, arms and provisions we left there?”

“Sure I remember that!” answered Glenn.“But do you really think they
had the nerve to try a scheme like that?”

“I haven’t the least doubt of it!” declared Ben.“It’s just one of their tricks,” agreed Glenn.“They must be rather lively young fellows!” suggested Mellen.“They certainly are!” answered Ben.“And now the question is this,” he
continued, “what ought we to do?”

“I’m afraid they’ll get into trouble,” Glenn suggested.“It was a foolhardy thing to do!” Mellen declared.“The idea of their
going back into the heart of that savage tribe is certainly
preposterous!I’m afraid they’re already in trouble.”

“Perhaps we ought to get the _Bertha_ and take a trip out there!”
suggested Glenn.“They may be in need of assistance.”

“That’s just my idea!” Ben agreed.“It seems to me that the suggested course is the correct one to pursue,”
Mellen said.“Perhaps we can get to the field before they leave for the valley,” Ben
interposed.“They spoke of going after the moon came up, and that was
only a short time ago.”

“Well,” said Mellen, “the quicker we act the more certain we shall be of
success.You boys get downstairs, if you can, without attracting much
attention, and I’ll go out and get a carriage.”

“Will you go with us to the field?” asked Ben.“I should be glad to,” was the reply.When the boys reached the corner of the next cross street, in ten
minutes’ time, they found Mellen waiting for them with a high-power
automobile.He was already in the seat with the chauffeur.“I captured a machine belonging to a friend of mine,” he said, with a
smile, “and so we shall be able to make quick time.”

As soon as the party came within sight of the field they saw that
something unusual was taking place there, for people were massing from
different parts of the plain to a common center, and people standing in
the highway, evidently about to seek their homes, turned and ran back.“Can you see the flying machines?” asked Ben.“I can see one of them!” answered Mellen in the front seat.“And it
seems to be mounting into the air!”

“I guess the little rascals have got off in spite of us!” declared Ben.“Perhaps we’d better hold up a minute and follow the direction it takes.It may not head for the valley.”

“It’s heading for the valley, all right!” Glenn exclaimed.“Yes, and there’s something going on in the field below,” Mellen
declared.“There are people running about, evidently in great
excitement, and the second machine is being pushed forward.”

“Do you think the little rascals have taken a machine apiece?” demanded
Ben.“There’s no knowing what they will do!”

“No, I don’t,” replied Glenn.“They’d be sure to stick together.”

“Then we’d better hustle up and find who’s taking out the second
machine!” exclaimed Ben.“This does look like trouble, doesn’t it?”

“Oh, it may be all right,” smiled Mellen.“The boys may have taken a
machine apiece.”

When the party reached the field the second flying machine was some
distance away.The driver, however, seemed to be wavering about in the
air as if uncertain of his control of the levers.Once or twice in an
uncertain current of air the _Bertha_ came near dropping to the ground.In time, however, he gained better control.One of the native policemen secured by Bixby rushed up to the automobile
as it came to a stop.He recognized Mellen in the car and addressed him
in Spanish, speaking as if laboring under great excitement.The boys listened to the conversation very impatiently, noting with no
little apprehension the look of anxiety growing on the face of the
manager as he listened to the story of the policeman.At length Mellen
turned to the boys and began translating what he had heard.The story told by the policeman was virtually the story told in the last
chapter, with the exception that it included the departure of Doran and
another in pursuit of the _Louise_.“The policeman,” Mellen went on, “is of the opinion that Doran means
mischief.He declares that he rather forced himself on Bixby, and was
instrumental in securing the absence of the two Englishmen who were to
assist him in guarding the aeroplanes.”

“It seems that the trouble arrived shortly after the Havens’ telegram,”
suggested Ben.“I wish I knew what it meant.”

“No one this side of Kingdom Come knows!” declared Glenn.“That is, no
one save Mr.“Anyway, it’s trouble!”

“How far is it to that valley?” asked Mellen.“At least twenty miles!” replied Ben.“Would it be possible to reach it in this machine?”

“I can’t answer that question,” replied Ben, “because it was dark when
we came over the ground.It seems, however, to be all up hill and down
on the way there.I don’t think the machine could make the trip.”

“I’ve a great notion to try it!” declared Mellen.“Anyway,” he went on,
“we can tour along in that direction.The man in charge of the last
aeroplane doesn’t seem to be next to his job and he may get a tumble.”

“And if he does,” cried Ben, “we’ll give him a lift, patch up the
machine, and start over to the old camp!”

And so, with the two machines in the air, the automobile went roaring
and panting over the rough mountain trails in the direction of the
valley!Occasionally the occupants saw the last machine but not often!“That other machine,” Jimmie observed glancing hastily in the direction
pointed out by Sam, “looks to me like the _Bertha_.”

“Can you identify an aeroplane at that distance in the night-time?”
asked Sam.“I’m sure I couldn’t do anything of the kind!”

“I don’t know as I can express it,” Jimmie replied, “but to me every
flying machine has a method and manner of its own.There is something in
the way an aeroplane carries itself in the sky which reminds me somewhat
of the manner of a man in walking.In the case of the man, you know who
it is long before you can see his face, and in the case of the flying
machine, you know her long before the details of construction are in
view.I’m sure that is the _Bertha_!”

“It is the _Bertha_, all right!” Carl cut in.“And she isn’t being
handled by one of our boys, either!”

“It isn’t possible, is it, that that fellow Doran found the nerve to
chase us up?” asked Jimmie.“If he did, he’s a poor aviator, all right!”

“It’s a wonder to me he doesn’t tip the machine over,” Sam suggested.“He may tip it over yet!” exclaimed Carl.“Just see, how it sways and
sags every time it comes to one of the little currents of air sweeping
out of the gorges.I anticipate a quick tumble there!”

“That’s a nice thing,” exclaimed Jimmie, “for some one to steal the
machine and break it up!If the _Bertha_ goes to pieces now, we’ll have
to delay our trip until another aeroplane can be bought, and the chances
are that we can never buy one as reliable as the _Bertha_.”

“She isn’t smashed yet!” grinned the tramp.“She’s headed straight for
the camp now, and may get here safely.The aviator seems to understand
how to control the levers, but he doesn’t know how to meet air currents.If he had known the country well enough, he might have followed an
almost direct river level to this point.”

“We didn’t know enough to do that!” Carl exclaimed.“We came over
mountains, gorges, and all kinds of dangerous precipices.”

“That was unnecessary,” laughed the tramp, still keeping his eyes fixed
on the slowly-approaching flying machine.“The south branch of the
Esmeraldas river rises in the volcano country somewhere south of Quito.The east branch of the same river rises something like a hundred miles
east and north of Quito.These two branches meet down there in front of
the camp.You can almost see the junction from here.”

“Could a boat sail down either branch of the river?” asked Carl.“I don’t know about that,” was the reply, “but there must be a
continuous valley from Quito to the junction.If yonder aviator had
followed that, or if you had followed it, there would have been no
trouble with gorge winds or gusty drafts circling around mountain tops.”

“Is there a road through the valley?” asked Jimmie.“A wagon road, I
mean.It seems that there ought to be.”

“There are a succession of rough trails used by teamsters,” was the
reply.The trails climb over ridges and
dip down into canyons, but it seems to me that the roadbed is remarkably
smooth.In fact, there seems to be a notion in the minds of the natives
that a very important commercial highway followed the line of the river
a good many centuries ago.I don’t know whether this is correct or not,
but I do know that the highway is virtually unknown to most of the
people living at Quito.I blundered on it by mistake.”

“We’ll go back that way,” Carl suggested, “and, as we can fly low down,
there will be no risk in taking you along with us.”

The flying machine which had been discovered approaching the camp a few
minutes before was now near enough so that two figures could be
distinguished on the seats.The machine was still reeling uncertainly,
the aviator undoubtedly seeking a place to land.“You see,” Carl explained, “the fellow is a stranger so far as this camp
is concerned.If he had ever been here before, he would now know exactly
what to do.Either Ben or Glenn could lay the machine within six inches
of the _Louise_ without half trying.”

“Then you are certain that it is not one of your friends in control of
the aeroplane?” asked Sam.“I am sure of that!” replied Jimmie.“Neither one of the boys would
handle a machine the way that one is being handled.”

“When she gets a little nearer we can tell whether that man Doran is on
board or not,” suggested Carl rather anxiously.“If you are certain that the machine has been stolen from the field
where she was left,” Sam went on, “you ought to decide without delay
what course to take when she lands.The man having her in charge may
have followed you here with hostile intentions.”

“That’s very true!” Carl agreed.“We have two automatics apiece,” Jimmie grinned, “and we know how to use
them, so we’ll be able to take care of ourselves, whatever happens!”

“And I have two which I found lying with the provision packages in one
of the tents,” said Sam.“Perhaps I shall be able now to pay for my
dinner.I’m always glad to do that whenever I can.”

The oncoming machine was now circling over the valley, and it seemed
that a landing would be made in a few minutes.The boys moved back to
where the _Louise_ lay, then stood waiting and watching anxiously.“Do you think the men on the machine saw you?” asked Jimmie, in a
moment, turning to Sam.“It doesn’t seem possible that they did!”

“Certainly not!” answered Sam.“You must remember that it is dark down
here, and that they are virtually looking into a black hole in the
hills.Only for the
remnants of the fire, I don’t believe they could have found the valley
at all!”

“Perhaps they haven’t seen us, either!” Carl suggested.“I don’t think they have,” Sam answered.“Then I’ll tell you what we’ll do!” Jimmie exclaimed.“We’ll scatter and
hide in three different places, in three different directions.Then,
when they land, we’ll perform the Jesse James act and order them to
throw up their hands!With six automatics pointing in their direction,
they’ll probably obey orders without argument.”

“I should think they would!” laughed Carl.“What’s the idea after that?” Sam questioned.“I don’t know,” Jimmie returned.“Anyway, we’ll get the machine and
leave them to walk back to Quito.By the time they have accomplished
that stunt, we’ll be on our way to the haunted temples of Peru.I’m
getting sick of this old country, anyway.”

Bending low in the darkness so as to avoid being seen from above, the
three scattered, in accordance with this arrangement, and lay, securely
hidden, in the tall grass when the _Bertha_ came wavering down.Owing to
the inexperience of the aviator, she struck the earth with a good deal
of a bump, and exclamations of rage were heard from the seats when the
motors were switched into silence.“This must be the place,” Jimmie heard one of the men saying, as the two
leaped to the ground.“There’s been a fire here not long ago, and there
are the tents, just as described by the boys.”

“Yes,” another voice said, “and there is the _Louise_ back in the
shadows.It’s a wonder we didn’t see her before.”

“But where are the boys?” the first speaker said.“We don’t care where the boys are,” a voice which Jimmie recognized as
that of Doran exclaimed.“The boys can do nothing without these
machines.It seems a pity to break them up.”

“We won’t break them up until we have to!” the other declared.“I was thinking of that,” Doran answered.“Suppose we pack up the tents
and provisions and such other things as we can use and take everything
away into some valley where we can hide the machines and all the rest
until this little excitement blows over.”

“That’s just the idea!” the other answered.“When things quiet down a
little we can get a good big price for these machines.”

“And in the meantime,” Doran continued, “we’ll have to catch the boys if
they interfere with our work.If they don’t, we’ll just pack up the
stuff and fly away in the machines.”

“And the two lads at Quito?” asked the other.“Oh,” Doran replied with a coarse laugh, “it will take them three or
four days to find out where their friends are, and a couple of weeks
more to get new machines, and by that time everything will be all lovely
down in Peru.It seems to be working out all right!”

Jimmie felt the touch of a hand upon his shoulder and in a moment, Carl
whispered in his ear:

“Do you mind the beautiful little plans they’re laying?” the boy asked.“Cunning little plans, so far as we’re concerned!” whispered Jimmie.“What do they mean by everything being lovely down in Peru after a
couple of weeks?” asked Carl.“That sounds mysterious!”

“You may search me!” answered Jimmie.“It looks to me, though, as if the
trouble started here might be merely the advance agent of the trouble
supposed to exist across the Peruvian boundary.”

“I suppose,” Carl went on, “that we’re going to lie right here and let
them pack up our stuff and fly away in our machines?”

“Yes, we are!” replied Jimmie.“What we’re going to do is to give those
fellows a little healthy exercise walking back to Quito.”

Directly Doran and his companion found a few sticks of dry wood which
had been brought in by the boys and began building up the fire, for the
double purpose of warmth and light.Then they both began tumbling the
tinned goods out of the tents and rolling the blankets which the boys
had used for bedding.“Ain’t it about time to call a halt?” asked Jimmie.“It certainly is!” Carl answered.“I wonder where our friend Sam is by
this time?He wouldn’t light out and leave us, would he?”

“I don’t think he would,” was the reply.“I have a notion that this
mix-up is just about to his taste!”

Just as Jimmie was about to show himself, revolvers in hand, preparatory
to sailing away in the machines and leaving the intruders with their
hands held well up, a murmur which seemed to come from a myriad of human
voices vibrated on the air and the tall grass all about the place where
the tents had been pitched seemed to be imbued with life.“Savages!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Gee!” whispered Carl, excitedly.“This location seems to be attracting
attention to-night!What are we going to do?”

“If those outlaws were away,” explained Jimmie, “we’d know well enough
what we ought to do!We’d make a rush for the machines and get aboard,
just as we did before.”

“I wonder if Doran and his companion will have sense enough to try
that?” asked Carl.“If they do, we’ll have to stop them, for we can’t
lose the machines.They ought to be shot, anyway.”

While the boys whispered together the savages, evidently in large
numbers, crept toward the aeroplanes in an ever-narrowing circle.As
luck would have it, the place where Jimmie and Carl were hidden was
permitted by the savages to make a break in the circle because of the
depression in which they lay, their heads on a level with the surface of
the earth.The savages swept almost over them, and in a moment, by lifting their
heads above the grass in the rear of the dusky line, they saw the
attacking party swarming around the tents and the machines.Doran and
his companion were seized, disarmed, and tied up with stout fiber woven
from the bark of a tree.Directly a scouting party brought Sam into the
group.The tramp had apparently surrendered without any attempt at defence, and
the boys wondered a little at that until they found themselves facing
lithe spears which waved significantly to and fro within six inches of
their heads!Then they, too, laid down their automatics, for they
understood very well that there was horrible death in the poisoned
shafts.They, too, were marched to the center of the group, now gathered about
the machines.Doran and his companion gazed at them with terror showing
in their faces, and the tramp seemed to consider the situation as too
serious for comment.He moved closer to the two boys, but was almost
immediately forced back by the savages.In a moment the war chants and ejaculations of victory died out while
two savages who seemed to be in charge of the party spoke together.During this silence, tense with excitement, the distant chug, chug, chug
of motors beat the air.The boys looked aloft for an aeroplane, yet did
not understand how one could possibly be there!The savages heard the clamor of the motors, too, and turned quick faces
of alarm toward their white prisoners, as if they alone could explain
what was coming to pass.Doran and his companion, also, turned
questioning glances toward the two boys, while a slow smile of
comprehension flitted over the face of the tramp.As the welcome sounds came nearer the savages gathered closer and moved
a short distance toward the thicket, their spears extended as if to
repel attack.“Do you know what that is?” he asked with a positive grin.“Sounds like an aeroplane!” suggested Jimmie.“Or like an automobile!” Carl put in.“Aw, how could an automobile get up here?” demanded Jimmie.“Don’t you remember the river road Sam was telling us about not long
ago?” asked Carl.“I guess an automobile could run along that, all
right!”

“Is that so?” asked Jimmie turning to Sam.“A superior machine driven by a superior chauffeur might,” was the
reply.“Anyway, that’s a motor-car coming, and there’s no other way to
get in here.We’ll see the lights in a moment.”

“Gee!” Jimmie exclaimed.“Do you think our friends chased the men who
stole the _Bertha_ up in a high-power automobile?”

“That’s just what I do think!” exclaimed Carl.“And that is undoubtedly the fact,” Sam agreed.Doran and his companion seemed to share in the pleasant anticipations
the boys were now sensing, for they approached them in a friendly manner
and began asking questions regarding the oncoming machine.The savages were still drawing farther away, and Sam occupied his time
during the next moment in finding his way back to the tents and
procuring another automatic revolver which had not been discovered by
the outlaws.He held it so that the two boys caught sight of the brown
barrel and nodded significantly toward Doran and his friend.“He doesn’t mean to let them get away,” said Jimmie to Carl, in a low
aside.“He seems to be next to his job!”

The savages, with their eyes fixed upon the jungle near the river bank,
kept crowding farther away from the machines.The clamor of the motors
came louder every instant, and directly two powerful acetylene lamps
looked out of the tall grass like great blazing eyes.The savages no longer hesitated as to how to meet this new situation.They dropped their spears and whatever else they had in their hands and
broke for the thicket, uttering such cries of fright and terror as the
boys had never imagined could issue forth from human lips.Doran and his
companion sprang for the machines as the savages disappeared.When Ben, Glenn and Mellen came bumping up in the automobile, a minute
later, they saw the two fellows standing by the side of the _Louise_
with their hands held high in the air.Before them stood Sam with a
threatening revolver pushed to within six inches of their faces.“Jerusalem!” exclaimed Ben, springing from the machine.“This looks like
a scene in one of the fierce old dramas they used to put on at the
Bowery theater!Are those the men who stole the _Bertha_?” he added
nodding toward the two whose arms were still held out.“They came here in the _Bertha_!” replied Carl.Mellen,” began Doran, “you know me well enough to know that I
wouldn’t get mixed up in any such thieving scrape!These two boys came
to the field and ran away with the _Louise_.I had orders not to let any
one take the machines away, so I followed them in the _Bertha_.”

“And he merely employed me to go with him!” the other fellow cut in.“They stole the machine!” insisted Jimmie.“I heard them talking about
leaving us here to walk back to Quito and hiding the machines in some
mountain valley until the search for them had died out.They were even
packing up our provisions and tents to take with them when the savages
came up!”

“So those were savages who took to the tall timber?” asked Glenn.“The same kind of people who drove us out of the valley,” answered
Jimmie.“They had the whole bunch pinched when your machine came dancing
merrily out of the woods!”

“And the way the <DW65>s took to the tall timber was a caution!”
exclaimed Carl.“They must be going yet!”

“Mr.Mellen,” broke in Doran, “I insist on being released from this
ridiculous position.I ask you to order this tramp to remove his
revolver.I am not used to such indignities.”

“He is not subject to my orders,” replied Mellen.The tramp looked at Doran with a humorous smile on his face.“I don’t understand,” he said, “how you managed to reach this place in a
road machine.It must have been awful going!”

“It certainly was!” answered Mellen.“Many a time I thought the machine
incapable of making the grades, and on various occasions we nearly
dropped over precipices.”

“I never was so scared in my life!” declared Ben.“Riding an aeroplane is a picture of peace and safety in comparison to
such a whirl as that!” declared Glenn.“I hung on with my toes most of
the way!And,” he added, with a grin, “I saw Ben getting ready to jump
several times.”

“We went so fast I couldn’t jump!” declared Ben.“I must congratulate you on the trip,” Sam cut in in a manner intended
to be friendly.“I don’t think any motor-car ever passed over that river
trail before!You certainly have blazed the way for others!”

“Tell it to the chauffeur!” laughed Mellen.“And now, boys,” he went on,
“seeing you have rescued your precious oiled-silk shelter-tents, we may
as well be getting back to the city.”

“I want to travel back in the _Bertha_!” exclaimed Ben.“And so do I!” Glenn cut in.“No more of that river ride for me!”

“That leaves me to the full command of the motor-car!” laughed Mellen.“I think one of you boys, at least, might ride back with me.”

“Why, if the boys take the machines,” Doran put in, “there’s nothing for
us to do but ride back in the motor-car.”

“You’ll walk so far as I’m concerned!” exclaimed Mellen.“Then I’ll act as first mate of the roadster,” suggested Sam, whereat
Mellen looked at the boys inquiringly.“He’s all right!” Jimmie exclaimed.“We found him here acting as
custodian of the camp,” he continued with a grin.“And you can see for
yourself how he pinched these two thieves.”

“Be careful boy!” almost shouted Doran.“You’ll have to answer for every
word you say against me!”

“I said ‘thieves’!” insisted Jimmie.“I overheard what you said before
the savages came up.You were going to make us walk back to Quito, and
now we’ll give you a dose of your own medicine.You’re the rascals
that’ll do the walking.”

Mellen called the boys aside and, after learning exactly what had taken
place, both at the field and at the camp, fully agreed that the men
ought to be obliged to walk back to Quito.“It will teach them a lesson,” he said, “and, besides, it will keep them
out of mischief for at least twenty-four hours!”

“Now,” Ben said, “Jimmie and I will go back in the _Louise_, and Glenn
and Carl can take the _Bertha_.Mellen, and Sam can return in
the automobile, and we’ll fly just above you along the river trail.If
you tumble over a precipice,” he added, with a smile, “we may be able to
pick you up, or you may be able to help us!”

“There is one thing about it,” Carl suggested, “and that is that we
won’t have to use the flying machines for freight wagons.The automobile
can carry the tents and provisions and everything of that sort back to
Quito.That will make it easier for us to duck about and watch the
course of the automobile.You may need watching, you know,” he added
turning to Mellen.“Especially,” he continued, “if you have Sam Weller
with you!”

The boys mounted the machines and were soon in the air, while Mellen and
Sam entered the motor-car, the latter keeping Doran and his companion
covered with an automatic revolver until the car was ready to start.Both men sprang forward as the wheels began to revolve.“Are you really going away and leave us to walk to Quito?” demanded
Doran.“The savages will be here in an hour after you leave!”

This was an argument which Mellen could not resist.It was perfectly
clear that the men would be murdered by the Indians if left there alone.“Perhaps,” he said, after some hesitation, “we’d better carry you far
enough to get you out of the Indian country.”

“Only five miles!” pleaded Doran.“Jump in!” replied the manager.The two men thanked Mellen effusively, but there was a crafty, scheming
look in Doran’s eyes which told plainly enough that he intended to take
advantage of the kindness of the manager at the very first opportunity.Sam saw the evil expression and placed the automatic within easy reach
of his hand.Doran saw the movement and snarled out an oath.“There’s no need for you to make any gun-play!” he scowled.“When I see a snake,” declared Sam, “I don’t take any chances on being
bitten!I know pretty well the kind of a sneak you are.”

“Look here!” exclaimed Doran, appealing to Mellen, “why don’t you take
us back to Quito and make complaint against us for stealing the machine?It seems to me that that is the correct thing for you to do!”

Mellen considered this proposition gravely for a moment.He believed now
that Doran was in some way mixed up in a conspiracy against the boys.Havens’ telegrams to Ben and
himself, the actions of the two men seemed significant.In fact, the
manager believed that the trouble referred to in Mr.Havens’ messages
had already made its appearance, guided by the hand of Doran!It seemed to him that the man’s plea was entirely reasonable, and yet he
understood that the fellows ought to be kept out of Quito as long as
possible.Even in jail, held only on a charge of grand larceny, Doran
would have little difficulty in securing a lawyer and communicating with
such other desperadoes as might be concerned in the conspiracy.“The savages,” Doran went on, pleadingly, “are scattered all through
this country, from the Colombia boundary line to Peru.It would be plain
murder to leave us here at this time!”

“I half believe the man is right!” Sam agreed.“You know I am right!” insisted Doran.The matter was one which Mellen hesitated to decide.He believed that,
by taking Doran to Quito, he would place the boys in some unknown peril;
and he believed, too, that by leaving the two men in the mountains he
might be contributing to their murder.“What do you think about it?” he asked, turning to Sam.“I wouldn’t turn a thieving dog over to those savages!” was the reply.“No civilized human being would!” Doran exclaimed.“Very well,” Mellen replied.“I’ll take you to the police office at
Quito and ask to have you locked up on a charge of grand larceny.”

“That will be satisfactory,” answered Doran.While entirely satisfied with the decision which had been reached, both
Mellen and Sam did not fully trust the two prisoners.They believed that
at some time during the return trip an attempt at escape would be made.The two pretended to be very much interested in the aeroplanes, which
were almost constantly in sight, yet Mellen saw that they inspected the
trail eagerly as if looking for some soft place to land.Believing that the men would attempt to leave the motor-car only when
within a short distance of Quito, the two did not watch them as closely
as they might have done.The attempt came when the car had covered only
about half the distance between the camp and the city.The chauffeur was coasting down a very steep declivity with the brakes
well in hand and Mellen and Sam were clinging tightly to the sides of
the machine when Doran sprang to his feet and leaped.His companion attempted to follow his example, but Sam’s hand was laid
upon his shoulder at that instant, and the two tumbled into the bottom
of the car.The struggle there was of short duration, for Sam was a
muscular fellow and the other combatant was not inclined to put up much
of a fight.It was impossible to stop the car on the steep grade, and so Mellen and
Sam were obliged to remain inactive while Doran struggled to his feet
and shook his fist at the car uttering as he did so threats of
vengeance.A FINE CURTAIN-RAISER.The sun was rising over the mountains when the flying machines and the
motor-car reached the field where the boys had landed the night before.After the escape of Doran, the aeroplanes had searched the hills and
gorges for the fugitive, but had found no trace of him observable from
the sky.After seeing that the machines were placed in charge of capable and
loyal officers, the boys entered the car with Mellen and were driven to
the hotel.When they reached the entrance they found a little crowd
assembled in the lobby.Messengers from the telegraph office were passing out and in, and the
clerk seemed to be answering a good many questions by ’phone.Mellen
stopped at the office counter while the boys took the elevator for their
rooms unobserved by the clerk in the office.“There’s something strange going on here!” the clerk exclaimed, as Mr.“We have a sheaf of telegrams for you, and a lot more
for those boys who came here last night.”

“Well,” smiled the manager, “you may as well deliver them.”

“Deliver them?” repeated the clerk.“How are we going to deliver them?You can receipt now for the ones which belong to you,” he went on, “but
what are we going to do with those directed to the boys?”

“Why, deliver them!” answered Mellen.“But the boys left the hotel last night!” replied the clerk angrily.“Without paying their bills!”

“But they are in their rooms now,” Mellen assured the clerk.“And they stole woolen blankets off the bed, too!” the clerk almost
shouted.“I ought to have them all arrested!”

As the clerk uttered the words in a loud tone a slender, black-eyed man
who seemed to Mellen to move about the corridor with the sinuous
undulations of a snake, stepped up to the desk.“So the fugitives have returned?” he asked.“Shall I arrest them at
once?You have made the charge, you know!”

“You will find the blankets in the boys’ room,” advised Mellen.“They
took them because they had a long, cold ride before them.”

“It is policy to restore stolen goods after discovery!” snarled the man
who had asked instructions of the clerk, and who occupied the very
honorable position of house detective.“Look here, Gomez!” exclaimed Mellen.The boys
had a right to use the blankets outside of the hotel as well as inside.”

“I shall do as the clerk says!” snarled the detective.“Oh, I suppose we’ll have to let it go if they’ve brought the blankets
back!” replied the clerk, reluctantly.Gomez turned away with a sullen frown on his face, and Mellen saw that
he had made an enemy of the fellow.“These boys are your friends?” asked the clerk of Mellen.“I never saw them until last night,” was the reply, “but I know that
they belong to the party of which Louis Havens, the millionaire aviator,
is the head.I presume the telegrams waiting for me here are from Mr.Havens, who expects to be here within twenty-four hours.”

“Not Louis Havens, the great explorer?” asked the clerk.“The same,” answered Mellen, “and if you’ve anything more to say about
the boys, say it to him.”

Taking the telegrams from the clerk, Mellen went back to the machine
and, after leaving the prisoner with the police, hastened to Ben’s room,
where the other boys were assembled.As he had supposed, the messages
were all from Mr.Havens, and all were repetitions of the warning which
had been sent the previous night.“I don’t understand what it means!” Ben said after the messages had been
read and discussed.“But it is a sure thing that Mr.Havens knows what
he is talking about.”

“I think we’d all better go and get a square meal and go to bed!” Jimmie
observed, rubbing his eyes.“The next time I get up in the night to take
a twenty-mile ride in the air, I won’t.”

“That’s very good sense,” Mellen agreed.“These telegrams, as you see,
state that Mr.Havens cannot possibly reach Quito until some time
to-night.”

“Then we can have a good sleep!” Carl agreed.“And sit up all night
again if we want to.”

“It hasn’t been such a bad night!” Ben observed.“If we had only kept
Doran, everything would be in pretty good shape now.”

“What did the chief of police say when you turned the other gink over to
him?” asked Carl.“He locked him up, didn’t he?”

“Yes, he locked him up!” answered Mellen.“But, before I left the
station, I saw the fellow at the ’phone and I presume he is out on bail
by this time.The police have no recourse if bail is offered.”

“Then I’ll tell you what you do!” advised Ben.“If he is admitted to
bail, you hire a private detective and have him watched.He is sure to
meet with Doran before very long.He may go to the hills to consult with
him, or Doran may come to the city, but the two fellows are certain to
come together!Then Doran can be arrested.”

“That’s a good idea,” Mellen answered, “and I’ll attend to the matter as
soon as I get back to my office.Now, we’ll all go down to a restaurant
and have breakfast.I’m hungry myself just now.”

“What’s the matter with the hotel?” asked Ben.Mellen did not care to explain to the boys exactly what had taken place
down stairs, but he felt that they would be treated with suspicion as
long as they remained there, so he decided to ask them to change their
quarters as soon as they returned from breakfast.Making the reply that the morning _table d’hote_ at the hotel was not
suitable for hungry boys who had been up all night, Mellen went with the
lads to a first-class restaurant.After breakfast he suggested a change
of hotels, saying only that they had already attracted too much
attention at the one where they were stopping, and the boys agreed
without argument.It took only a short time to locate in the new
quarters, and the boys were soon sound asleep.When Ben awoke, some one was knocking at his door, and directly he heard
a low chuckle which betrayed the presence of Jimmie in the corridor.“Get a move on!” the latter shouted.“What’s up?” asked Ben.“Time’s up!” replied Jimmie.“Open up!” almost yelled Carl.Ben sprang out of bed, half-dressed himself, and opened the door.The
first face he saw was that of Mr.Havens, who looked dusty and tired as
if from a long journey.As may be imagined, the greetings between the two were very cordial.In
a moment the boys all flocked into Ben’s room, where Mr.Havens was
advised to freshen up in the bath before entering upon the business in
hand.“You must have had a merry old time with the _Ann_,” laughed Ben.“Never saw anything like it!” exclaimed Mr.“Did she break down?”

“Half a dozen times!”

“Perhaps there was some good reason for it,” suggested Glenn,
significantly.“Indeed there was!” answered Mr.“Couldn’t you catch him?” asked Jimmie.“I could not!” was the reply.While the millionaire remained in the bath-room, the boys discussed all
manner of surmises concerning the accidents which had happened to the
_Ann_.They had not yet heard a word of explanation from Mr.Havens
concerning the warnings of trouble which had been received by wire, but
they understood that the interferences to the big aeroplane were only
part of the general trouble scheme which seemed to have broken loose the
night before.“We don’t know anything about it!” exclaimed Jimmie.“And we won’t know
anything about it until Mr.Havens gets cleaned up and tells us, so we
may as well talk about hens, or white bulldogs, until he gets ready to
open up.By the way,” the boy continued, “where is Sam?”

“Mellen took him down to get him into decent clothes,” Ben answered.“Is he coming back here?” asked Jimmie.“I rather like that fellow.”

“Of course he’s coming back!” Ben replied.“He’s hasn’t got any other
place to go!He’s flat broke and hungry.”

“I thought perhaps he wouldn’t like to meet Mr.Havens,” Jimmie
commented, with a wink at Carl.“And why not?” asked Ben, somewhat amazed.Then the story of Sam Weller’s previous employment at the hangar on Long
Island came out.The boys all declared that they wanted to be present
when Sam met his former employer!“I don’t care what you say about Sam!” Jimmie declared, after the boys
had finished their discussion of the Long Island incident.“I like him
just the same!There’s a kind of a free and easy impudence about him
that gets me.I hope he’ll stay with us!”

“He might ride with Mr.Havens in the _Ann_!” laughed Carl.“Well, I don’t believe Mr.Havens would object, at that!” declared
Jimmie.“Certainly he wouldn’t object!” replied the millionaire, coming out of
the bath-room door with a smile on his face.“And so Sam Weller showed
up here, did he?” he asked as he seated himself.“The boy is a
first-class aviator, but he used to get his little finger up above his
nose too often, so I had to let him go.Did he tell any of you boys how
he happened to drift into this section?”

“He told me,” Jimmie replied, “that he was making a leisurely trip from
the Isthmus of Panama to Cape Horn.He looked the part, too, for I guess
he hadn’t had a square meal for several decades, and his clothes looked
as if they had been collected out of a rag-bag!”

“He’s a resourceful chap!” Mr.“He’s a first-class
aviator, as I said, in every way, except that he is not dependable, and
that of course spoils everything.”

“He’s got the nerve!” Carl observed.“He certainly has!” agreed Jimmie.Havens said in a moment, “if you boys like Sam, we’ll take
him along.We have room for one more in the party.”

“And that brings us down to business!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Right here,”
he went on, “is where we want you to turn on the spot light.We’ve had
so many telegrams referring to trouble that we’re beginning to think
that Trouble is our middle name!”

“Perhaps we would better wait until Mellen and Sam return,” suggested
Mr.“That will save telling the story two or three times.”

“Is Sam Weller really his name?” asked Jimmie.“I don’t think so,” answered Havens.“I think it is merely a name he
selected out of the Pickwick Papers.While in my employ on Long Island
several people who knew him by another name called to visit with him.Now and then I questioned these visitors, but secured little
information.”

“Perhaps he’s a Pittsburg Millionaire or a Grand Duke in disguise!”
suggested Carl.“And again,” the boy went on, “he may be merely the
black sheep in some very fine family.”

“There’s something a little strange about the boy,” Mr.Havens agreed,
“but I have never felt myself called upon to examine into his
antecedents.”

“Here he comes now!” cried Carl.“With a new suit of clothes on his back
and a smile lying like a benediction all over his clean shave!”

The boys were glad to see that the millionaire greeted Sam as an old
friend.For his part, Sam extended his hand to his former employer and
answered questions as if he had left his employ with strong personal
letters of recommendation to every crowned head in the world!“And now for the story,” Mellen said after all were seated.“And when you speak of trouble,” Jimmie broke in, “always spell it with
a big ‘T’, for that’s the way it opened out on us!”

“I’m going to begin right at the beginning,” Mr.Havens said, with a
smile, “and the beginning begins two years ago.”

“Gee!” exclaimed Jimmie.“That’s a long time for trouble to lie in wait
before jumping out at a fellow!”

“In fact,” Mr.Havens went on, “the case we have now been dumped into,
heels over head, started in New York City two years ago, when Milo
Redfern, cashier of the Invincible Trust Company, left the city with a
half million dollars belonging to the depositors.”

“That’s a good curtain lifter!” exclaimed Carl.“When you open a drama
with a thief and a half million dollars, you’ve started something!”




                               CHAPTER X.

                        WHERE THE TROUBLE BEGAN.“When Redfern disappeared,” Mr.Havens went on, “we employed the best
detective talent in America to discover his whereabouts and bring him
back.The best detective talent in America failed.”

“That ain’t the way they put it in stories!” Carl cut in.“We spent over a hundred thousand dollars trying to bring the thief to
punishment, and all we had to show for this expenditure at the end of
the year was a badly spelled letter written—at least mailed—on the lower
East Side in New York, conveying the information that Redfern was hiding
somewhere in the mountains of Peru.”

“There you go!” exclaimed Ben.“The last time we went out on a little
excursion through the atmosphere, we got mixed up with a New York murder
case, and also with Chinese smugglers, and now it seems that we’ve got
an embezzlement case to handle.”

“Embezzlement case looks good to me!” shouted Jimmie.“Hiding in the mountains of Peru?” repeated Sam.“Now I wonder if a man
hiding in the mountains of Peru has loyal friends or well-paid agents in
the city of Quito.”

“There!” exclaimed Mr.“Sam has hit the nail on the head the
first crack.I never even told the boys when they left New York that
they were bound for Peru on a mission in which I was greatly interested.I thought that perhaps they would get along better and have a merrier
time if they were not loaded down with official business.”

“That wouldn’t have made any difference!” announced Carl.“We’d have
gone right along having as much fun as if we were in our right minds!”

“When I started away from the hangar in the _Ann_,” Mr.Havens
continued, with a smile at the interruption, “I soon saw that some one
in New York was interested in my remaining away from Peru.”

“Redfern’s friends of course!” suggested Mellen.“Exactly!” replied the millionaire.“And Redfern’s friends appeared on the scene last night, too,” Jimmie
decided.“And they managed to make quite a hit on their first
appearance, too,” he continued.“And this man Doran is at present ready
for another engagement if you please.He’s a foxy chap!”

“I’m sorry he got away!” Mellen observed.“Yes, it’s too bad,” Mr.Havens agreed, “but, in any event, we couldn’t
have kept him in prison here isolated from his friends.”

“There’s one good thing about it,” Ben observed, “and that is that we’ve
already set a trap to catch him.”

“How’s that?” asked the millionaire.Mellen has employed a detective to follow Doran’s companion on the
theory that sometime, somewhere, the two will get together again.”

“That’s a very good idea!” Mr.“Now about this man Redfern,” Mr.“Is he believed to be
still in the mountains of Peru?”

“I have at least one very good reason for supposing so,” answered the
millionaire.“Yes, I think he is still there.”

“Give us the good reason!” exclaimed Carl.“I guess we want to know how
to size things up as we go along!”

“The very good reason is this,” replied Mr.Havens with a smile, “the
minute we started in our airships for the mountains of Peru, obstacles
began to gather in our way.The friends or accomplices of Redfern began
to flutter the instant we headed toward Peru.”

“That strikes me as being a good and sufficient reason for believing
that he is still there!” Mellen commented.“Yes, I think it is!” replied the millionaire.“And it is an especially
good reason,” he went on, “when you understand that all our previous
plans and schemes for Redfern’s capture have never evoked the slightest
resistance.”

“Then the embezzler is in Peru, all right, all right!” laughed Carl.“But Peru is a very large country,” suggested Mr.“There’s a good deal of land in the country,” agreed Jimmie.“When you
come to measure the soil that stands up on end, I guess you’d find Peru
about as large as the United States of America!”

“What are the prospects?” asked Mellen.“What I mean,” he continued, “is
this: Can you put your finger on any one spot on the map of Peru and
say—look there first for Redfern.”

“Yes,” replied Mr.Havens, “I think I can.If you ask me to do it, I’ll
just cover Lake Titicaca with my thumb and tell you to pull Redfern out
of the water as soon as you get to that part of old Incaland!”

“Je-rusalem!” exclaimed Jimmie.“And that takes us right down to the
haunted temple!”

“What kind of a lake is this Titicaca?” asked Glenn.“Don’t you ever read anything except base-ball stories and police court
records?” asked Ben, turning to his friend.“Before I was seven years
old I knew that Lake Titicaca is larger than Lake Erie; that it is five
inches higher in the summer than in the winter, and that the longer you
keep a piece of iron or steel in it the brighter it will become.”

“Is it a fact that the waters of this lake do not rust metal?” asked
Mellen.“That seems to me to be a peculiar circumstance.”

“I have often heard it stated as a fact,” replied Mr.“Ask any one who knows, if you won’t believe me,” Ben went on with a
provoking smile.“It is said that Lake Titicaca represents the oldest
civilization in the world.There are temples built of stones larger than
those used in the pyramids of Egypt.The stones have remained in
position after a century because of the nicety with which they are
fitted together.It is said to be impossible to drive the finest needle
between the seams of the walls composed of granite rocks.”

“But what did they want to build such temples and fortresses for?”
demanded Jimmie.“Why didn’t they spend more time playing base-ball?”

“You’re a nut on base-ball!” laughed Ben.“The temples which exist to-day were there when the Incas settled the
country,” the boy continued.“They knew no more of their origin than we
do at this time!”

“They may be a million years old!” exclaimed Carl.“Perhaps that’s as good a guess as any,” replied Ben.“We don’t know how
old they are, and never shall know.”

“Isn’t it a little remarkable,” said Mellen, “that an act of
embezzlement committed in New York City more than two years ago should
lead to a visit to ruined temples in Peru?”

“Now about this Lake Titicaca, about which Ben has given us a bit of
history,” Mr.Havens said, after replying briefly to Mellen’s question.“We have every reason to believe that Redfern has been living in some of
the ancient structures bordering the lake.”

“Did you ever try to unearth the East Side person who wrote the letter
you have just referred to?” asked Ben.“We have spent thousands of dollars in quest of that person,” replied
the millionaire, “and all to no purpose.”

“And what do we do to-morrow?” asked Jimmie, breaking into the
conversation in true boy-fashion.“Why, we’re going to start for Peru!” cried Carl.“And the haunted temples!” laughed Ben.“Honest, boys,” he went on, “I
don’t believe there’s anything in this haunted temple yarn.There may be
temples which are being guarded from the ravages of the superstitious by
interested persons who occasionally play the ghost, but so far as any
supernatural manifestations are concerned the idea is ridiculous.”

“Don’t you ever say anything like that in the vicinity of Lake
Titicaca,” Mellen suggested.“If you do, the natives will suddenly
discover that you are robbers, bent on plunder, and some night, your
bodies may find a resting-place at the bottom of the lake.”

“Do they really believe the temples to be haunted?” asked Glenn.“There are people in whose interest the superstition is kept up,”
replied Ben.“These interested people would doubtless gladly perform the
stunt just suggested by Mellen.”

“I think I’ve got the combination now!” Jimmie laughed.“See if I’m
right.The temples still hold stores of gold, and those searching for
the treasure are keeping adventurous people away by making the ghost
walk.”

“That’s the idea!” Ben replied.“And, look here!” Sam broke in.“Why shouldn’t this man Redfern have a
choice collection of ghosts of his own?”

“That’s an idea, too,” Mr.“I’ll bet he has!” Jimmie insisted.“Then we’ll examine the homes of the ghosts first,” grinned Jimmie.“We’ll walk up to the portal and say: ‘Mr.Ghost, if you’ll materialize
Redfern, we’ll give you half of the reward offered for him by the trust
company.’ That ought to bring him, don’t you think?”

“And here’s another idea,” Sam interrupted.“If Redfern has ghosts in
the temple in which he is hiding—if he really is hiding in a Peruvian
temple—his ghosts will be the most active ghosts on the job.In other
words, we’ll hear more about his haunted temple than any other haunted
temple in all Peru.His ghosts will be in a constant state of eruption!”

“And that’s another good idea,” suggested Mr.“Oh, Sam is wise all right,” Jimmie went on.“I knew that the minute he
told me about unearthing the provisions in the tent before he knew
whether the savages were coming back!”

“Gentlemen,” began Sam, with one of his smooth smiles, “I was so hungry
that I didn’t much care whether the savages came back or not.It
appeared to me then that the last morsel of food that had passed my lips
had exhausted itself at a period farther away than the birth of Adam!”

“You must have been good and hungry!” laughed Mellen.“What did you wander off into that country for?” asked Jimmie.“You
might have known better.”

“I couldn’t remain in the Canal Zone,” replied Sam, “because no one
would give me a job.Everybody seemed to want to talk to me for my own
good.Even the chief in charge of the Gatun dam contract told me——”

“Do you know the chief in charge of the Gatun dam contract?” asked
Havens, casually.“You spoke of him a moment ago as if you had met him
personally.”

“Well, you see,” Sam went on, hesitatingly, “you see I just happened
to——”

The confusion of the young man was so great that no further questions
were asked of him at that time, but all understood that he had
inadvertently lifted a curtain which revealed previous acquaintance with
men like the chief in charge of the Gatun dam.The boy certainly was a
mystery, and they all decided to learn the truth about him before
parting company.Havens said, breaking a rather oppressive silence, “are we
all ready for the roof of the world to-morrow?”

“You bet we’re all ready!” cried Jimmie.“I’m ready right now!” exclaimed Carl.“Will you go with us, Sam?” asked Mr.“I should be glad to!” was the reply.No more was said on the subject at that time, yet all saw by the
expression on the tramp’s face how grateful he was for this new chance
in life which Mr.“Jerusalem!” exclaimed Jimmie in a moment, jumping to his feet and
rushing toward the door.“I’ve forgotten something!”

“Something important?” asked Ben.I should say so!” replied Jimmie.“I forgot to eat my
dinner, and I haven’t had any supper yet!”

“How did you come to do it?” asked Mellen.“I didn’t wake up!” was the reply.“And now,” the boy went on, “you see
I’ve got to go and eat two meals all at once.”

“I’ll eat one of them for you,” suggested Sam.“And I’ll eat the other!” volunteered Ben.“Yes you will,” grinned Jimmie.“I don’t need any help when it comes to
supplying the region under my belt with provisions.”

The boys hustled away to the dining-room, it being then about seven
o’clock, while Mr.Havens and Mellen hastened back to the manager’s
office.Passing through the public lobby, the manager entered his private room
and opened a sheaf of telegrams lying on the table.He read it carefully, twice
over, and then turned a startled face toward the manager.The manager glanced at the millionaire’s startled face for a moment and
then asked, his voice showing sympathy rather than curiosity:

“Unpleasant news, Mr.Havens?”

“Decidedly so!” was the reply.The millionaire studied over the telegram for a moment and then laid it
down in front of the manager.“Read it!” he said.The message was brief and ran as follows:

  “Ralph Hubbard murdered last night!Private key to deposit box A
  missing from his desk!”

“Except for the information that some one has been murdered,” Mellen
said, restoring the telegram to its owner, “this means little or nothing
to me.I don’t think I ever knew Ralph Hubbard!”

“Ralph Hubbard,” replied the millionaire gravely, “was my private
secretary at the office of the Invincible Trust Company, New York.All
the papers and information collected concerning the search for Milo
Redfern passed through his hands.In fact, the letter purporting to have
been written and mailed on the lower East Side of New York was addressed
to him personally, but in my care.”

“And deposit box A?” asked Mellen.“Pardon me,” he added in a moment, “I
don’t seek to pry into your private affairs, but the passing of the
telegram to me seemed to indicate a desire on your part to take me into
your confidence in this matter.”

“Deposit box A,” replied the millionaire, “contained every particle of
information we possess concerning the whereabouts of Milo Redfern.”

“I see!” replied Mellen.“I see exactly why you consider the murder and
robbery so critically important at this time.”

“I have not only lost my friend,” Mr.Havens declared, “but it seems to
me at this time that I have also lost all chance of bringing Redfern to
punishment.”

“I’m sorry,” consoled Mellen.“I don’t know what to do now,” the millionaire exclaimed.“With the
information contained in deposit box A in their possession, the
associates of Redfern may easily frustrate any move we may make in
Peru.”

“So it seems!” mused Mellen.“But this man Redfern is still a person of
considerable importance!Men who have passed out of the range of human
activities seldom have power to compel the murder of an enemy many
hundreds of miles away.”

“I have always believed,” Mr.Havens continued, “that the money
embezzled by Redfern was largely used in building up an institution
which seeks to rival the Invincible Trust Company.”

“In that case,” the manager declared, “the whole power and influence of
this alleged rival would be directed toward the continued absence from
New York of Redfern.”

“Exactly!” the millionaire answered.“Then why not look in New York first?” asked Mellen.“Until we started away on this trip,” was the reply, “we had nothing to
indicate that the real clew to the mystery lay in New York.”

“Did deposit box A contain papers connecting Redfern’s embezzlement with
any of the officials of the new trust company?” asked the manager.“Certainly!” was the reply.The manager gave a low whistle of amazement and turned to his own
telegrams.The millionaire sat brooding in his chair for a moment and
then left the room.At the door of the building, he met Sam Weller.Havens,” the young man said, drawing the millionaire aside, “I want
permission to use one of your machines for a short time to-night.”

“Granted!” replied Mr.“I’ve got an idea,” Sam continued, “that I can pick up valuable
information between now and morning.I may have to make a long flight,
and so I’d like to take one of the boys with me if you do not object.”

“They’ll all want to go,” suggested the millionaire.“I know that,” laughed Sam, “and they’ve been asleep all day, and will
be prowling around asking questions while I’m getting ready to leave.I
don’t exactly know how I’m going to get rid of them.”

“Which machine do you want?” asked Mr.“The _Ann_, sir, if it’s all the same to you.”

“You’re quite welcome to her,” the millionaire returned.“Well, then, with your permission,” continued Sam, “I’ll smuggle Jimmie
out to the field and we’ll be on our way.The machine has plenty of
gasoline on board, I take it, and is perfect in other ways?”

“I believe her to be in perfect condition, and well supplied with fuel,”
was the answer.“She’s the fastest machine in the world right now.”

Sam started away, looking anything but a tramp in his new clothes, but
turned back in a moment and faced his employer.“If we shouldn’t be back by morning,” he said, then, “don’t do any
worrying on our account.Start south in your machines and you’ll be
certain to pick us up somewhere between Quito and Lake Titicaca.If you
don’t pick us up within a day or two,” the boy continued in a hesitating
tone, “you’ll find a letter addressed to yourself at the local
post-office.”

“Look here, Sam,” suggested Mr.Havens, “why don’t you tell me a little
more about yourself and your people?”

“Sometime, perhaps, but not now,” was the reply.“The letter, you
understand,” he continued, “is not to be opened until you have
reasonable proof of my death.”

“I understand!” the millionaire answered.“But here’s another thing,” he
added, “you say that we may find you between Quito and Lake Titicaca.Are you acquainted with that region?”

“Well, I know something about it!” replied Sam.“You see,” he continued,
“when I left your employ in the disgraceful manner which will at once
occur to you, I explained to Old Civilization that she might go and hang
herself for all of me.I ducked into the wilderness, and since that time
I’ve spent many weeks along what is known as the roof of the world in
Peru.”

“I wish you luck in your undertaking!” Mr.Havens said as the young man
turned away, “and the only advice I give you at parting is that you take
good care of yourself and Jimmie and enter upon no unnecessary risks!”

“That’s good advice, too!” smiled Sam, and the two parted with a warm
clasp of the hands.After leaving the millionaire aviator at the telegraph office, Sam
hastened to the hotel where the boys were quartered and called Jimmie
out of the little group in Ben’s room.They talked for some moments in
the corridor, and then Jimmie thrust his head in at the half-open door
long enough to announce that he was going out with Sam to view the city.The boys were all on their feet in an instant.“Me, too!” shouted Ben.“You can’t lose me!” cried Carl.Glenn was at the door ready for departure with the others.“No, no!” said Sam shaking his head.“Jimmie and I are just going out
for a little stroll.Unfortunately I can take only one person besides
myself into some of the places where I am going.”

The boys shut the door with a bang, leaving Carl on the outside.The lad
turned the knob of the door and opened and closed it to give the
impression that he, too, had returned to the apartment.Then he moved
softly down the corridor and, still keeping out of sight, followed Sam
and Jimmie out in the direction of the field where the machines had been
left.The two conversed eagerly, sometimes excitedly during the walk, but of
course, Carl could hear nothing of what was being said.There was quite
a crowd assembled around the machines, and so Carl had little difficulty
in keeping out of sight as he stepped close to the _Ann_.After talking
for a moment or two with one of the officers in charge of the machines,
Sam and Jimmie leaped into the seats and pushed the starter.As they did so Jimmie felt a clutch at his shoulders, and then a light
body settled itself in the rather large seat beside him.“You thought you’d get away, didn’t you?” grinned Carl.“Look here!” shouted Jimmie as the powerful machine swept across the
field and lifted into the air, “you can’t go with us!”

“Oh, I can’t?” mocked Carl.“I don’t know how you’re going to put me
off!You don’t want to stop the machine now, of course!”

“But, see here!” insisted Jimmie, “we’re going on a dangerous mission!We’re likely to butt into all kinds of trouble.And, besides,” he
continued, “Sam has provisions for only two.You’ll have to go hungry if
you travel with us.We’ve only five or six meals with us!”

“So you’re planning a long trip, eh?” scoffed Carl.“What will the boys
say about your running off in this style?”

“Oh, keep still!” replied Jimmie.“We’re going off on a mission for Mr.You never should have butted in!”

“Oh, let him go!” laughed Sam, as the clamor of the motors gradually
made conversation impossible.“Perhaps he’ll freeze to death and drop
off before long.I guess we’ve got food enough!”

There was no moon in the sky as yet, but the tropical stars looked down
with surprising brilliancy.The country below lay spread out like a
great map.As the lights of Quito faded away in the distance, dark
mountain gorges which looked like giant gashes in the face of mother
earth, mountain cones which seemed to seek companionship with the stars
themselves, and fertile valleys green because of the presence of
mountain streams, swept by sharply and with the rapidity of scenes in a
motion-picture house.As had been said, the _Ann_ had been constructed for the private use of
the millionaire aviator, and was considered by experts to be the
strongest and swiftest aeroplane in the world.On previous tests she had
frequently made as high as one hundred miles an hour on long trips.The
motion of the monster machine in the air was so stable that the
millionaire had often taken prizes for endurance which entitled him to
medals for uninterrupted flights.Jimmie declares to this day that the fastest express train which ever
traveled over the gradeless lines of mother earth had nothing whatever
on the flight of the _Ann_ that night!Although Sam kept the machine
down whenever possible, there were places where high altitudes were
reached in crossing cone summits and mountain chains.At such times the temperature was so low that the boys shivered in their
seat, and more than once Jimmie and Carl protested by signs and gestures
against such high sailing.At two o’clock when the moon rose, bringing every detail of the country
into bold relief, Sam circled over a green valley and finally brought
the aeroplane down to a rest hardly more than four thousand feet above
sea-level.It was warm here, of course, and the two boys almost dropped
from their seat as the fragrant air of the grass-grown valley reached
their nostrils.While Sam busied himself with the running gear of the
flying machine, Jimmie and Carl sprawled out on the lush grass and
compared notes.The moonlight struck the valley so as to illuminate its
western rim while the eastern surface where the machine lay was still
heavy in shadows.“Jiminy!” exclaimed Jimmie, lifting himself on one elbow and gazing at
the wrinkled cones standing all around the valley.“I wonder how Sam
ever managed to drop into this cosy little nest without breaking all our
necks.”

Sam, who seemed to be unaffected by the cold and the strain of the long
flight, stood, oil-can in hand, when the question was asked.In a moment
he walked over to where the boys lay.“I can tell you about that,” he said with a smile.“Not long ago I had a
job running an old ice-wagon of an aeroplane over this country for a
naturalist.We passed this spot several times, and at last came back
here for a rest.Not to put too fine a point upon it, as Micawber would
say, we remained here so long that I became thoroughly acquainted with
the country.It is a lonesome little valley, but a pleasant one.”

“Well, what did we come here for?” asked Carl, in a moment, “and how far
are we from Quito?Seems like a thousand miles!”

“We are something like four hundred miles from the capital city of
Ecuador,” Sam replied, “and the reason why we landed here will be
disclosed when you chase yourselves along the valley and turn to the
right around the first cliff and come face to face with the cunningest
little lake you ever saw, also the haunted temple which stands there!”




                              CHAPTER XII.“A haunted temple?” echoed Jimmie.“I thought the haunted temples were a
lot farther south.”

“There are haunted temples all over Peru, if you leave it to the
natives,” answered Sam.“Whenever there is a reason for keeping
strangers away from such ruins as we are about to visit, the ghosts come
forth at night in white robes and wave weird lights above skeleton
faces.”

“Quit it!” cried Carl.“I’ve got the creeps running up and down my back
right now!Bring me my haunted temples by daylight!”

“Yes,” scorned Jimmie, “we’ll bring you a little pet ghost in a
suit-case.That would be about your size!”

“Honest,” grinned the boy, “I’m scared half to death.”

“What’s the specialty of the ghosts who inhabit this ruined temple?”
asked Jimmie.“Can’t you give us some idea of their antics?”

“If I remember correctly,” Sam replied, with a laugh, “the specialty of
the spirits to whom I am about to introduce you consists of low, soft
music.How does that suit?”

“I tell you to quit it!” cried Carl.“After I prepare the aeroplane for another run,” Sam went on, with a
grin, “I’ll take you around to the temple, if you like.”

“Mother of Moses!” cried Carl.“My hair’s all on end now; and I won’t
dare look into a mirror in the morning for fear I’ll find it turned
white.”

“There’s a strange feeling in my system, too!” Jimmie declared, “but I
think it comes from a lack of sustenance.”

“Jimmie,” declared Carl reproachfully, “I believe you would pick the
pocket of a wailing ghost of a ham sandwich, if he had such a thing
about him!”

“Sure I would!” answered the boy.“What would a ghost want of a ham
sandwich?In those old days the people didn’t eat pork anyway.If you
read the history of those days, you’ll find no mention of the wriggly
little worms which come out of pigs and made trouble for the human
race.”

“Well, if you’re ready now,” Sam broke in, “we’ll take a walk around the
corner of the cliff and see if the ghosts are keeping open house
to-night.”

“You really don’t believe in these ghosts, do you?” asked Jimmie.“I do not!” was the reply.“There ain’t no such animal, is there?” asked Carl.“I have never witnessed any ‘supernatural’ things,” Sam answered, “which
could not be traced eventually to some human agency.Usually to some
interested human agency.”

“Well,” grinned Carl, “if there ain’t any ghosts at this ruined temple,
what’s the use of my going there to see them?”

“You may remain and watch the machine if you care to,” Sam replied.“While we are supposed to be in a valley rarely frequented by human
kind, it may be just as well to leave some one on guard.For instance,”
the young man went on, “a jaguar might come along and eat up the
motors!”

“Jaguars?” exclaimed Carl.“Are they the leopard-like animals that chase
wild horses off the pampas of Brazil, and devour men whenever they get
particularly hungry?”

“The same!” smiled Sam.“Then I want to see the ghosts!” exclaimed Carl.“Come along, then,” advised Sam.“If you didn’t know Carl right well,” Jimmie explained, as they walked
along, “you’d really think he’d tremble at the sight of a ghost or a
wild animal, but he’s the most reckless little idiot in the whole bunch!He’ll talk about being afraid, and then he’ll go and do things that any
boy in his right mind ought not to think of doing.”

“I had an idea that that was about the size of it!” smiled Sam.Presently the party turned the angle of the cliff and came upon a placid
little mountain lake which lay glistening under the moonlight.“Now, where’s your ruined temple?” asked Carl.“At the southern end of the lake,” was the reply.“I see it!” cried Jimmie.“There’s a great white stone that might have
formed part of a tower at one time, and below it is an opening which
looks like an entrance to the New York subway with the lights turned
off.”

The old temple at the head of the lake had frequently been visited by
scientists and many descriptions of it had been written.It stood boldly
out on a headland which extended into the clear waters, and had
evidently at one time been surrounded by gardens.“I don’t see anything very mysterious about that!” Carl remarked.“It
looks to me as if contractors had torn down a cheap old building in
order to erect a skyscraper on the site, and then been pulled off the
job.”

“Wait until you get to it!” warned Jimmie.“I’m listening right now for the low, soft music!” laughed Carl.“Does any one live there?” asked Jimmie in a moment.“As the place is thought by the natives to be haunted,” Sam answered,
“the probability is that no one has set foot inside the place since the
naturalist and myself explored its ruined corridors several weeks ago.”

The boys passed farther on toward the temple, and at last paused on the
north side of a little arm of the lake which would necessitate a wide
detour to the right.From the spot where they stood, the walls of the temple glittered as if
at sometime in the distant past they had been ornamented with designs in
silver and gold.The soft wind of the valley sighed through the openings
mournfully, and it required no vigorous exercise of the imagination to
turn the sounds into man-made music.“Come on, Jimmie,” Carl shouted.“Let’s go and get a front seat.The
concert is just about to begin!”

“There is no hurry!” Jimmy answered.While the three stood viewing the scene, one which never passed from
their memory, a tall, stately figure passed out of the entrance to the
old temple and moved with dignified leisure toward the margin of the
lake.“Now, who’s that?” demanded Carl.“The names of the characters appear on the program in the order of their
entrance!” suggested Jimmie.“Honest, boys,” Sam whispered, “I think you fellows deserve a medal
apiece.Instead of being awed and frightened, standing as you do in the
presence of the old temple, and seeing, as you do, the mysterious figure
moving about, one would think you were occupying seats at a minstrel
show!”

“You said yourself,” insisted Jimmie, “that there wasn’t any such thing
as ghosts.”

“That’s right,” exclaimed Carl.“What’s the use of getting scared at
something that doesn’t exist?”

“The only question in my mind at the present time,” Jimmie went on, with
a grin, “is just this: Is that fellow over there carrying a gun?”

While the boys talked in whispers, Sam had been moving slowly to the
west so as to circle the little cove which separated him from the
temple.In a moment the boys saw him beckoning them to him and pointing toward
the ruins opposite.The figure which had been before observed was now standing close to the
lip of the lake, waving his hands aloft, as if in adoration or
supplication.This posture lasted only a second and then the figure
disappeared as if by magic.There were the smooth waters of the lake with the ruined temple for a
background.There were the moonbeams bringing every detail of the scene
into strong relief.Nothing had changed, except that the person who a
moment before had stood in full view had disappeared as if the earth had
opened at his feet.“Now what do you think of that?” demanded Jimmie.“Say,” chuckled Carl, “do you think that fellow is custodian of the
temple, and has to do that stunt every night, the same as a watchman in
New York has to turn a key in a clock every hour?”

Jimmie nudged his chum in the ribs in appreciation of the observation,
and then stood silent, his eyes fixed on the broken tower across the
cove.While he looked a red light burned for an instant at the apex of the old
tower, and in an instant was followed by a blue light farther up on the
cliff.“You didn’t answer my question,” Carl insisted, in a moment.“Do you
think they pull off this stunt here every night?”

“Oh, keep still!” exclaimed Jimmie.“They don’t have to pull it off
every night.They only put the play on when there’s an audience.”

“An audience?” repeated Carl.“How do they know they’ve got an
audience?”

“Chump!” replied Jimmie scornfully.“Do you think any one can sail an
aeroplane like the _Ann_ over this country without its being seen?Of
course they know they’ve got an audience.”

By this time the boys had advanced to the place where Sam was standing.They found that young man very much interested in the proceedings, and
also very much inclined to silence.“Did you see anything like that when you were here before?” asked
Jimmie.“Did they put the same kind of a show on for you?”

Sam shook his head gravely.“Well, come on!” Carl cried.“Let’s chase around the cove and get those
front seats you spoke about.”

“Wait, boys!” Sam started to say, but before the words were well out of
his mouth the two lads were running helter-skelter along the hard white
beach which circled the western side of the cove.“Come back!” he called to them softly.“It isn’t safe.”

The boys heard the words but paid no heed, so Sam followed swiftly on in
pursuit.He came up with them only after they had reached the very steps
which had at some distant time formed an imposing entrance to a sacred
temple.“What are you going to do?” he demanded.“We’re going inside!” replied Carl.“What do you think we came here for?I guess we’ve got to see the inside.”

“Don’t take any unnecessary risks!” advised Sam.“What’d you bring us here for?” asked Carl.“Oh, come on!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Let’s all go in together!”

Sam hesitated, but the boys seized him by the arms and almost forced him
along.In a moment, however, he was as eager as the others.“Do you mean to say,” asked Jimmie, as they paused for a moment on a
broad stone slab which lay before the portal of the ruined temple, “that
you went inside on your former visit?”

“I certainly did!” was the reply.“Then why are you backing up now?” asked Carl.“On my previous visit,” Sam explained, standing with his back against
the western wall of the entrance, “there were no such demonstrations as
we have seen to-night.Now think that over, kiddies, and tell me what it
means.It’s mighty puzzling to me!”

“Oh, we’ve got the answer to that!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Did you come here
in an aeroplane, or did you walk in?”

“We came in on an aeroplane, early in the morning,” was the reply.“That’s the answer!” exclaimed Jimmie.“The people who are operating
these ghost stunts did not know you were coming because they saw no
lights in the sky.Now we came down with a noise like an express train
and a great big acetylene lamp burning full blast.Don’t you see?”

“That’s the idea!” Carl cried.“The actors and stage hands all
disappeared as soon as you showed around the angle of the cliff.”

“But why should they go through what you call their stunts at this time,
and not on the occasion of my former visit?” asked Sam.“I’ll tell you,” replied Jimmie wrinkling his freckled nose, “there’s
some one who is interested in the case which called us to Peru doing
those stunts.”

“In that case,” Sam declared, “they have a definite reason for keeping
us out of this particular ruin!”

“That’s the idea!” exclaimed Jimmie.“So far as we know, this man
Redfern or some of his associates may be masquerading as ghosts.”

“I came to this temple to-night,” explained Sam, “thinking that perhaps
this might be one of the way stations on the road to Lake Titicaca.”

“You have guessed it!” exclaimed Jimmie.“The men who have been sent
south to warn Redfern are doing their first stunts here!”

“And that,” said Sam, “makes our position a dangerous one!”




                             CHAPTER XIII.“I wonder if they expect to scare us out of the country by such
demonstrations as that?” scoffed Carl.“There is, doubtless, some reason for this demonstration,” Sam observed,
thoughtfully, “other than the general motive to put us in terror of
haunted temples, but just now I can’t see what it is.”

“Redfern may be hiding in there!” suggested Jimmie, with a wink.“Go on!” exclaimed Carl.Havens say that Redfern was in the
vicinity of Lake Titicaca?How could he be here, then?”

“Mr.Havens only said that Redfern was believed to be in the vicinity of
Lake Titicaca,” Sam corrected.“Then they don’t even know where he is!” exclaimed Carl.“Of course they don’t,” laughed Sam.“If they did, they’d go there and
get him.That’s an easy one to answer!”

“Well, if Redfern isn’t in that ruin,” Jimmie declared, “then his own
friends don’t know where he is!”

“Yes, it seems to me,” Sam agreed, “that the men who are trying to reach
him are as much at sea as we are regarding his exact location.”

“If they wasn’t,” Jimmie declared, “they wouldn’t be staging such plays
as that on general principles!”

“Well!” exclaimed Carl.“Here we stand talking as if we had positive
information that the Redfern gang is putting on those stunts, while, as
a matter of fact, we don’t know whether they are or not!”

“And that’s a fact, too!” said Jimmie.“The people in there may be
ignorant of the fact that a man named Redfern ever existed.”

“But the chances are that the Redfern bunch is doing the work all the
same!” insisted Sam.“The only way to find out is to go on in and see!” declared Carl.“Well, come on, then!” exclaimed Jimmie.The two boys darted in together, leaving Sam standing alone for an
instant.He saw the illumination thrown on the interior walls by their
searchlights and lost no time in following on after them.There was not even the sound of bird’s
call or wing.The moonlight, filtering in through a break in what had
once been a granite roof, showed bare white walls with little heaps of
debris in the corners.“It seems to me,” Sam said, as he looked around, “that the ghosts have
chosen a very uncomfortable home.”

“There must be other rooms,” suggested Carl.“There are two which still retain the appearance of apartments as
originally constructed,” replied Sam, “one to the right, and one to the
left.There seems, also, to have been an extension at the rear, but that
is merely a heap of hewn stones at this time.”

As the young man ceased speaking the two boys darted through an opening
in the west wall, swinging their flashlights about as they advanced into
what seemed to be a stone-walled chamber of fair size.Following close
behind, Sam saw the lads directing the rays of their electrics upon a
series of bunks standing against the west wall.The sleeping places were
well provided with pillows and blankets, and seemed to have been very
recently occupied.Sam stepped closer and bent over one of the bunks.“Now, what do you think about ghosts and ghost lights?” asked Jimmie.“These ghosts,” Carl cut in, “seem to have a very good idea as to what
constitutes comfort.”

“Three beds!” exclaimed Jimmie, flashing his light along the wall.“And
that must mean three ghosts!”

Sam proceeded to a corner of the room as yet uninvestigated and was not
much surprised when the round eye of his electric revealed a rough
table, made of wooden planks, bearing dishes and remnants of food.He
called at once to the boys and they gathered about him.“Also,” Carl chuckled, “the three ghosts do not live entirely upon
spiritual food.See there,” he continued, “they’ve had some kind of a
stew, probably made out of game shot in the mountains.”

“And they’ve been making baking powder biscuit, too!” Carl added.“I don’t suppose it would be safe to sample that stew?” Jimmie asked
questioningly.“It looks good enough to eat!”

“Not for me!” declared Carl.While the boys were examining the table and passing comment on the
articles it held, Sam moved softly to the doorway by which they had
entered and looked out into the corridor.Looking from the interior out
to the moonlit lake beyond, the place lost somewhat of the dreary
appearance it had shown when viewed under the searchlights.The walls
were of white marble, as was the floor, and great slashes in the slabs
showed that at one time they had been profusely ornamented with designs
in metal, probably in gold and silver.The moonlight, filtering through the broken roof, disclosed a depression
in the floor in a back corner.This, Sam reasoned, had undoubtedly held
the waters of the fountain hundreds of years before.Directly across
from the doorway in which he stood he saw another break in the wall.On a previous visit this opening, which had once been a doorway, had
been entirely unobstructed.Now a wall of granite blocks lay in the
interior of the apartment, just inside the opening.It seemed to the
young man from where he stood that there might still be means of
entrance by passing between this newly-built wall and the inner surface
of the chamber.Thinking that he would investigate the matter more fully in the future,
Sam turned back to where the boys were standing, still commenting on the
prepared food lying on the table.As he turned back a low, heavy grumble
agitated the air of the apartment.The boys turned quickly, and the three stood not far from the opening in
listening attitudes.The sound increased in volume as the moments
passed.At first it seemed like the heavy vibrations of throat cords,
either human or animal.Then it lifted into something like a shrill
appeal, which resembled nothing so much as the scream of a woman in
deadly peril.Involuntarily the boys stepped closer to the corridor.“What do you make of it?” whispered Jimmie.“Ghosts!” chuckled Carl.“Some day,” Jimmie suggested, in a graver tone than usual, “you’ll be
punished for your verbal treatment of ghosts!I don’t believe there’s
anything on the face of the earth you won’t make fun of.How do we know
that spirits don’t come back to earth?”

“They may, for all I know,” replied Carl.“I’m not trying to decide the
question, or to make light of it, either, but when I see the lot of
cheap imitations like we’ve been put against to-night, I just have to
express my opinion.”

“They’re cheap imitations, all right!” decided Jimmie.“Cheap?” repeated Carl.“Flowing robes, and disappearing figures, and
mysterious lights, and weird sounds!Why, a fellow couldn’t work off
such manifestations as we’ve seen to-night on the most superstitious
residents of the lower West Side in the City of New York, and they’ll
stand for almost anything!”

“It strikes me,” Sam, who had been listening to the conversation with an
amused smile, declared, “that the sounds we are listening to now may
hardly be classified as wailing!”

“Now, listen,” Carl suggested, “and we’ll see if we can analyze it.”

At that moment the sound ceased.The place seemed more silent than before because of the sudden
cessation.“It doesn’t want to be analyzed!” chuckled Carl.“Come on,” Jimmie urged, “let’s go and see what made it!”

“I think you’ll have to find out where it came from first!” said Carl.“It came from the opening across the second apartment,” explained Sam.“I had little difficulty in locating it.”

“That doesn’t look to me like much of an opening,” argued Carl.“The stones you see,” explained Sam, “are not laid in the entrance from
side to side.They are built up back of the entrance, and my idea is
that there must be a passage-way between them and the interior walls of
the room.That wall, by the way, has been constructed since my previous
visit.So you see,” he added, turning to Carl, “the ghosts in this neck
of the woods build walls as well as make baking powder biscuits.”

“Well, that’s a funny place to build a wall!” Carl asserted.“Perhaps the builders don’t like the idea of their red and blue lights
and ghostly apparatus being exposed to the gaze of the vulgar public,”
suggested Jimmie.“That room is probably the apartment behind the scenes
where the thunder comes from, and where some poor fellow of a supe is
set to holding up the moon!”

“Well, why don’t we go and find out about it?” urged Carl.“Wait until I take a look on the outside,” Sam requested.“The man in
the long white robe may be rising out of the lake by this time.I don’t
know,” he continued, “but that we have done a foolish thing in remaining
here as we have, leaving the aeroplane unguarded.”

“Perhaps I’d better run around the cliff and see if it’s all right!”
suggested Carl.“I’ll be back in a minute.”

“No,” Sam argued, “you two remain here at the main entrance and I’ll go
and see about the machine.Perhaps,” he warned, “you’d better remain
right here, and not attempt to investigate that closed apartment until I
return.I shan’t be gone very long.”

“Oh, of course,” replied Jimmie, “we’ll be good little boys and stand
right here and wait for you to come back—not!”

Carl chuckled as the two watched the young man disappear around the
angle of the cliff.“Before he gets back,” the boy said, “we’ll know all about that room,
won’t we?Say,” he went on in a moment, “I think this haunted temple
business is about the biggest fraud that was ever staged.If people only
knew enough to spot an impostor when they saw one, there wouldn’t be
prisons enough in the world to hold the rascals.”

“You tell that to Sam to-night,” laughed Jimmie.“He likes these
moralizing stunts.Are you going in right now?”

By way of reply Carl stepped into the arch between the two walls and
turned to the right into a passage barely more than a foot in width.Jimmie followed his example, but turned to the left.There the way was
blocked by a granite boulder which reached from the floor to the roof
itself.“Nothing doing here!” he called back to Carl.“I’ve found the way!” the latter answered.We’ll be
behind the scenes in about a minute.”

The passage was not more than a couple of yards in length and gave on an
open chamber which seemed, under the light of the electrics, to be
somewhat larger than the one where the conveniences of living had been
found.The faint illumination produced by the flashlights, of course
revealed only a small portion of it at a time.While the boys stood at the end of the narrow passage, studying the
interior as best they might under the circumstances, a sound which came
like the fall of a heavy footstep in the corridor outside reached their
ears.“There’s Sam!” Carl exclaimed.“We’ll leave him at the entrance and go
in.There’s a strange smell here, eh?”

“Smells like a wild animal show!” declared Jimmie.Other footsteps were now heard in the corridor, and Jimmie turned back
to speak with Sam.“That’s Sam all right enough!” the latter exclaimed.“Don’t go away
right now, anyhow.”

“What’s doing?” asked Jimmie.“There’s a light back there!” was the reply, “and some one is moving
around.Can’t you hear the footsteps on the hard stone floor?”

“Mighty soft footsteps!” suggested Jimmie.“Well, I’m going to know exactly what they are!” declared Carl.“Well, why don’t you go on, then?” demanded Jimmie.The two boys stepped forward, walking in the shaft of light proceeding
from their electrics.Once entirely clear of the passage, they kept
straight ahead along the wall and turned the lights toward the center of
the apartment, which seemed darker and drearier than the one recently
visited.Besides the smell of mold and a confined atmosphere there was an odor
which dimly brought back to the minds of the boys previous visits to the
homes of captive animals at the Central Park zoo.“Here!” cried Jimmie directly, “there’s a door just closed behind us!”




                              CHAPTER XIV.When Sam Weller turned the corner of the cliff and looked out at the
spot where the _Ann_ had been left, his first impression was that the
machine had been removed from the valley.He stood for a moment in uncertainty and then, regretting sincerely that
he had remained so long away, cautiously moved along, keeping as close
as possible to the wall of the cliff.In a moment he saw the planes of
the _Ann_ glistening in the moonlight at least a hundred yards from the
place where she had been left.Realizing the presence of hostile interests, he walked on toward the
planes, hoping to be able to get within striking distance before being
discovered.There was no one in sight in the immediate vicinity of the
_Ann_, and yet she was certainly moving slowly over the ground.The inference the young man drew from this was that persons unfamiliar
with flying machines had invaded the valley during his absence.Not
being able to get the machine into the air, they were, apparently, so
far as he could see, rolling it away on its rubber-tired wheels.The
progress was not rapid, but was directed toward a thicket which lay at
the west end of the valley.“That means,” the young man mused, “that they’re trying to steal the
machine!It is evident,” he went on, “that they are apprehensive of
discovery, for they manage to keep themselves out of sight.”

Realizing that it would be impossible for him to pass through the open
moonlight without being observed by those responsible for the erratic
motions of the _Ann_, the young man remained standing perfectly still in
a deep shadow against the face of the cliff.The _Ann_ moved on toward the thicket, and presently reached the shelter
of trees growing there.In a moment she was entirely hidden from view.“Now,” thought Sam, “the people who have been kind enough to change the
position of the machine will doubtless show themselves in the
moonlight.”

In this supposition he was not mistaken, for in a moment two men dressed
in European garments emerged from the shadows of the grove and took
their way across the valley, walking through the moonlight boldly and
with no pretense of concealment.Sam scrutinized the fellows carefully, but could not remember that he
had ever seen either of them before.They were dusky, supple chaps,
evidently of Spanish descent.As they walked they talked together in
English, and occasionally pointed to the angle of the cliff around which
the young man had recently passed.A chattering of excited voices at the edge of the grove now called Sam’s
attention in that direction, and he saw at least half a dozen figures,
apparently those of native Indians, squatting on the ground at the very
edge of the thicket.“And now,” mused Sam, as the men stopped not far away and entered into
what seemed to him to be an excited argument, “I’d like to know how
these people learned of the revival of the hunt for Redfern!It isn’t so
very many days since Havens’ expedition was planned in New York, and
this valley is a good many hundred miles away from that merry old town.”

Entirely at a loss to account for the manner in which information of
this new phase of the search had reached a point in the wilds of Peru
almost as soon as the record-breaking aeroplane could have carried the
news, the young man gave up the problem for the time being and devoted
his entire attention to the two men in European dress.“I tell you they are in the temple,” one of the men said speaking in a
corrupt dialect of the English language which it is useless to attempt
to reproduce.“They are in the temple at this minute!”

“Don’t be too sure of that, Felix!” the other said.“And what is more,” the man who had been called Felix went on, “they
will never leave the temple alive!”

“And so fails the great expedition!” chuckled the second speaker.“When we are certain that what must be has actually taken place,” Felix
went on, “I’ll hide the flying machine in a safer place, pay you as
agreed, and make my way back to Quito.Does that satisfy you?”

“I shall be satisfied when I have the feeling of the gold of the
Gringoes!” was the reply.Sam caught his breath sharply as he listened to the conversation.“There was some trap in the temple, then,” he mused, “designed to get us
out of the way.I should have known that,” he went on, bitterly, “and
should never have left the boys alone there!”

The two men advanced nearer to the angle of the cliff and seemed to be
waiting the approach of some one from the other side.“And Miguel?” asked Felix.“Why is he not here?”

“Can you trust him?” he added, in a moment.“With my own life!”

“The Gringoes are clever!” warned Felix.“But see!” exclaimed the other.There surely can be no mistake.”

The men lapsed into silence and stood listening.Sam began to hope that
their plans had indeed gone wrong.For a moment he was uncertain as to what he ought to do.He believed
that in the absence of the two leaders he might be able to get the _Ann_
into the air and so bring assistance to the boys.And yet, he could not
put aside the impression that immediate assistance was the only sort
which could ever be of any benefit to the two lads!“If they are in some trap in the temple,” he soliloquized, “the thing to
do is to get to them as soon as possible, even if we do lose the
machine, which, after all, is not certain.”

“The flying machine,” the man who had been called Felix was now heard to
say, “is of great value.It would bring a fortune in London.”

“But how are you to get it out of this district just at this time?”
asked the other.“How to get it out without discovery?”

“Fly it out!”

“Can you fly it out?” asked the other in a sarcastic tone.“There are plenty who can!” replied Felix, somewhat angrily.“But it is
not to be taken out at present,” he went on.“To lift it in the air now
would be to notify every Gringo from Quito to Lima that the prize
machine of the New York Millionaire, having been stolen, is in this part
of the country.”

“That is very true,” replied the other.“Hence, I have hidden it,” Felix went on.Are they safe?” was the next question.“As safe as such people usually are!” was the answer.As Sam Weller listened, his mind was busily considering one expedient
after another, plan after plan, which presented the least particle of
hope for the release of the boys.From the conversation he had overheard
he understood that the machine would not be removed for a number of
days—until, in fact, the hue and cry over its loss had died out.This, at least, lightened the difficulties to some extent.He could
devote his entire attention to the situation at the temple without
thought of the valuable aeroplane, but how to get to the temple with
those two ruffians in the way!Only for the savage associates in the
background, it is probable that he would have opened fire on the two
schemers.That was a sufficient reason, to
his mind, to bring about decisive action on his part.However, the
savages were there, just at the edge of the forest, and an attack on the
two leaders would undoubtedly bring them into action.Of course it was
not advisable for him to undertake a contest involving life and death
with such odds against him.The two men were still standing at the angle of the cliff.Only for the brilliant moonlight, Sam believed that he might elude their
vigilance and so make his way to the temple.But there was not a cloud
in the sky, and the illumination seemed to grow stronger every moment as
the moon passed over to the west.At last the very thing the young man had hoped for in vain took place.A
jumble of excited voices came from the thicket, and the men who were
watching turned instantly in that direction.As they looked, the sound
of blows and cries of pain came from the jungle.“Those brutes will be eating each other alive next!” exclaimed Felix.“That is so!” answered the other.“I warned you!”

“Suppose you go back and see what’s wrong?” suggested Felix.“I have no influence over the savages,” was the reply, “and besides, the
temple must be watched.”

With an exclamation of anger Felix started away in the direction of the
forest.It was evident that he had his work cut out for him there, for
the savages were fighting desperately, and his approach did not appear
to terminate the engagement.The man left at the angle of the cliff to watch and wait for news from
the temple moved farther around the bend and stood leaning against the
cliff, listening.The rattling of a
pebble betrayed the young man’s presence, and his hands upon the throat
of the other alone prevented an outcry which would have brought Felix,
and perhaps several of the savages, to the scene.It was a desperate, wordless, almost noiseless, struggle that ensued.The young man’s muscles, thanks to months of mountain exercise and
freedom from stimulants and narcotics, were hard as iron, while those of
his opponent seemed flabby and out of condition, doubtless because of
too soft living in the immediate past.The contest, therefore, was not of long duration.Realizing that he was
about to lapse into unconsciousness, Sam’s opponent threw out his hands
in token of surrender.The young man deftly searched the fellow’s person
for weapons and then drew him to his feet.“Now,” he said, presenting his automatic to the fellow’s breast, “if you
utter a word or signal calculated to bring you help, that help will come
too late, even if it is only one instant away.At the first sound or
indication of resistance, I’ll put half a clip of bullets through your
heart!”

“You have the victory!” exclaimed the other sullenly.“Move along toward the temple!” demanded Sam.“It is not for me to go there!” was the reply.“And I’ll walk along behind you,” Sam went on, “and see that you have a
ballast of bullets if any treachery is attempted.”

“It is forbidden me to go to the temple to-night,” the other answered,
“but, under the circumstances, I go!”

Fearful that Felix might return at any moment, or that the savages,
enraged beyond control, might break away in the direction of the temple,
Sam pushed the fellow along as rapidly as possible, and the two soon
came to the great entrance of that which, centuries before, had been a
sacred edifice.The fellow shuddered as he stepped into the musty
interior.“It is not for me to enter!” he said.“And now,” Sam began, motioning his captive toward the chamber where the
bunks and provisions had been discovered, “tell me about this trap which
was set to-night for my chums.”

“I know nothing!” was the answer.“That is false,” replied Sam.“I overheard the conversation you had with
Felix before the outbreak of the savages.”

“I know nothing!” insisted the other.“Now, let me tell you this,” Sam said, flashing his automatic back and
forth under the shaft of light which now fell almost directly upon the
two, “my friends may be in deadly peril at this time.It may be that one
instant’s hesitation on your part will bring them to death.”

The fellow shrugged his shoulders impudently and threw out his hands.Sam saw that he was watching the great entrance carefully, and became
suspicious that some indication of the approach of Felix had been
observed.“I have no time to waste in arguments,” Sam went on excitedly.“The trap
you have set for my friends may be taking their lives at this moment.I
will give you thirty seconds in which to reveal to me their whereabouts,
and to inform me as to the correct course to take in order to protect
them.”

The fellow started back and fixed his eyes again on the entrance, and
Sam, following his example, saw something which sent the blood rushing
to his heart.Outlined on the white stone was the shadow of a human being!Although not in sight, either an enemy or a friend was at hand!“Door?” repeated Carl, in reply to his chum’s exclamation.“There’s no
door here!”

“But there is!” insisted Jimmie.“I heard the rattle of iron against
granite only a moment ago!”

As the boy spoke he turned his flashlight back to the narrow passage and
then, catching his chum by the arm, pointed with a hand which was not
altogether steady to an iron grating which had swung or dropped from
some point unknown into a position which effectually barred their return
to the outer air!The bars of the gate, for it was little else, were not
brown and rusty but bright and apparently new.“That’s a new feature of the establishment,” Jimmie asserted.“That gate
hasn’t been long exposed to this damp air!”

“I don’t care how long it hasn’t been here!” Carl said, rather crossly.“What I want to know is how long is it going to remain there?”

“I hope it will let us out before dinner time,” suggested Jimmie.“Away, you and your appetite!” exclaimed Carl.“I suppose you think this
is some sort of a joke.You make me tired!”

“And the fact that we couldn’t get out if we wanted to,” Jimmie grinned,
“makes me hungry!”

“Cut it out!” cried Carl.“The thing for us to do now is to find some
way of getting by that man-made obstruction.”

“Man-made is all right!” agreed Jimmie.“It is perfectly clear, now,
isn’t it, that the supernatural had nothing to do with the
demonstrations we have seen here!”

“I thought you understood that before!” cried Carl, impatiently.Jimmie, who stood nearest to the gate, now laid a hand upon one of the
upright bars and brought his whole strength to bear.The obstruction
rattled slightly but remained firm.“Can’t move it!” the boy said.“We may have to tear the wall down!”

“And the man who swung the gate into position?” questioned Carl.“What
do you think he’ll be doing while we’re pulling down that heap of
stones?You’ve got to think of something better than that, my son!”

“Anyway,” Jimmie said, hopefully, “Sam is on the outside, and he’ll soon
find out that we’ve been caught in a trap.”

“I don’t want to pose as a prophet of evil, or anything like that,” Carl
went on, “but it’s just possible that he may have been caught in a trap,
too.Anyway, it’s up to us to go ahead and get out, if we can, without
any reference to assistance from the outside.”

“Go ahead, then!” Jimmie exclaimed.“I’m in with anything you propose!”

The boys now exerted their united strength on the bars of the gate, but
all to no purpose.So far as they could determine, the iron contrivance
had been dropped down from above into grooves in the stone-work on
either side.The bars were an inch or more in thickness, and firmly
enclosed in parallel beams of small size which crossed them at regular
intervals.Seeing the condition of affairs, Jimmie suggested:

“Perhaps we can push it up!”

“Anything is worth trying!” replied Carl.But the gate was too firmly in place to be moved, even a fraction of an
inch, by their joint efforts.“Now, see here,” Jimmie said, after a short and almost painful silence,
“there’s no knowing how long we may be held in this confounded old
dungeon.We’ll need light as long as we’re here, so I suggest that we
use only one flashlight at a time.”

“That will help some!” answered Carl, extinguishing his electric.Jimmie threw his light along the walls of the chamber and over the
floor.There appeared to be no break of any kind in the white marble
which shut in the apartment, except at one point in a distant corner,
where a slab had been removed.“Perhaps,” suggested Carl, “the hole in the corner is exactly the thing
we’re looking for.”

“It strikes me,” said Jimmie, “that one of us saw a light in that corner
not long ago.I don’t remember whether you called my attention to it, or
whether I saw it first, but I remember that we talked about a light in
the apartment as we looked in.”

“Perhaps we’d better watch the hole a few minutes before moving over to
it,” suggested Carl.“The place it leads to may hold a group of savages,
or a couple of renegades, sent on here to make trouble for casual
visitors.”

“Casual visitors!” repeated Jimmie.“That doesn’t go with me!You know,
and I know, that this stage was set for our personal benefit!How the
Redfern bunch got the men in here so quickly, or how they got the
information into this topsy-turvy old country, is another question.”

“I presume you are right,” Carl agreed.“In some particulars,” the boy
went on, “this seems to me to be a situation somewhat similar to our
experiences in the California mountains.”

“Right you are!” cried Jimmie.The circle of light from the electric illuminated the corner where the
break in the wall had been observed only faintly.Determined to discover
everything possible regarding what might be an exit from the apartment,
Jimmie kept his light fixed steadily on that corner.In a couple of minutes Carl caught the boy by the arm and pointed along
the finger of light.“Hold it steadier now,” he said.“I saw a movement there just now.”

“What kind of a movement?” asked the other.“Looked like a ball of fire.”

“It may be the cat!” suggested Jimmie.“Quit your foolishness!” advised Carl impatiently.“This is a serious
situation, and there’s no time for any grandstanding!”

“A ball of fire!” repeated Jimmie scornfully.“What would a ball of fire
be doing there?”

“What would a blue ball of fire be doing on the roof?” asked Carl,
reprovingly.“Yet we saw one there, didn’t we?”

Although Jimmie was inclined to treat the situation as lightly as
possible, he knew very well that the peril was considerable.Like a good
many other boys in a trying situation, he was usually inclined to keep
his unpleasant mental processes to himself.He now engaged in what
seemed to Carl to be trivial conversation, yet the desperate situation
was no less firmly impressed upon his mind.The boys waited for some moments before speaking again, listening and
watching for the reappearance of the object which had attracted their
attention.“There!” Carl cried in a moment.“Move your light a little to the left.I’m sure I saw a flash of color pass the opening.”

“I saw that too!” Jimmie agreed.“Now what do you think it can be?”

In a moment there was no longer doubt regarding the presence at the
opening which was being watched so closely.The deep vocal vibrations
which had been noticed from the other chamber seemed to shake the very
wall against which the boy stood.As before, it was followed in a moment
by the piercing, lifting cry which on the first occasion had suggested
the appeal of a woman in agony or terror.The boys stood motionless, grasping each other by the hand, and so each
seeking the sympathy and support of the other, until the weird sound
died out.“And that,” said Jimmie in a moment, “is no ghost!”

“Ghost?” repeated Carl scornfully.“You may as well talk about a ghost
making that gate and setting it against us!”

“Anyway,” Jimmie replied, “the wail left an odor of sulphur in the air!”

“Yes,” answered Carl, “and the sulphur you speak of is a sulphur which
comes from the dens of wild beasts!Now do you know what we’re up
against?”

“Mountain lions!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Jaguars!” answered Carl.“I hope they’re locked in!” suggested Jimmie.“Can you see anything that looks like a grate before that opening?”
asked Carl.“I’m sure I can’t.”

“Nothing doing in that direction!” was the reply.At regular intervals, now, a great, lithe, crouching body could be seen
moving back and forth at the opening, and now and then a cat-like head
was pushed into the room!At such times the eyes of the animal, whatever
it was, shone like balls of red fire in the reflection of the electric
light.Although naturally resourceful and courageous, the two boys
actually abandoned hope of ever getting out of the place alive!“I wonder how many wild animals there are in there?” asked Carl in a
moment.“It seems to me that I have seen two separate figures.”

“There may be a dozen for all we know,” Jimmie returned.“Gee!” he
exclaimed, reverting to his habit of concealing serious thoughts by
lightly spoken words, “Daniel in the lion’s den had nothing on us!”

“How many shots have you in your automatic?” asked Carl, drawing his own
from his pocket.“We’ll have to do some shooting, probably.”

“Why, I have a full clip of cartridges,” Jimmie answered.“But have you?” insisted Carl.“Why, surely, I have!” returned Jimmie.“Don’t you remember we filled
our guns night before last and never——”

“I thought so!” exclaimed Carl, ruefully.“We put in fresh clips night
before last, and exploded eight or nine cartridges apiece on the return
trip to Quito.Now, how many bullets do you think you have available?One or two?”

“I don’t know!” replied Jimmie, and there was almost a sob in his voice
as he spoke.“I presume I have only one.”

“Perhaps the electric light may keep the brutes away,” said Carl
hopefully.“You know wild animals are afraid of fire.”

“Yes, it may,” replied Jimmie, “but it strikes me that our little
torches will soon become insufficient protectors.Those are jaguars out
there, I suppose you know.And they creep up to camp-fires and steal
savage children almost out of their mothers’ arms!”

“Where do you suppose Sam is by this time?” asked Carl, in a moment, as
the cat-like head appeared for the fourth or fifth time at the opening.“I’m afraid Sam couldn’t get in here in time to do us any good even if
he stood in the corridor outside!” was the reply.“Whatever is done,
we’ve got to do ourselves.”

“And that brings us down to a case of shooting!” Carl declared.“It’s only a question of time,” Jimmie went on, “when the jaguars will
become hungry enough to attack us.When they get into the opening, full
under the light of the electric, we’ll shoot.”

“I’ll hold the light,” Carl argued, “and you do the shooting.You’re a
better marksman than I am, you know!When your last cartridge is gone,
I’ll hand you my gun and you can empty that.If there’s only two animals
and you are lucky with your aim, we may escape with our lives so far as
this one danger is concerned.How we are to make our escape after that
is another matter.”

“If there are more than two jaguars,” Jimmie answered, “or if I’m
unlucky enough to injure one without inflicting a fatal wound, it will
be good-bye to the good old flying machines.”

“That’s about the size of it!” Carl agreed.All this conversation had occurred, of course, at intervals, whenever
the boys found the heart to put their hopes and plans into words.It
seemed to them that they had already spent hours in the desperate
situation in which they found themselves.The periods of silence,
however, had been briefer than they thought, and the time between the
departure of Sam and that moment was not much more than half an hour.“There are two heads now!” Jimmie said, after a time, “and they’re
coming out!Hold your light steady when they reach the center of the
room.I can’t afford to miss my aim.”

“Is your arm steady?” almost whispered Carl.“Never better!” answered Jimmie.Four powerful, hungry, jaguars, instead of two, crept out of the
opening!Jimmie tried to cheer his companion with the whispered hope
that there might possibly be bullets enough for them all, and raised his
weapon.Two shots came in quick succession, and two jaguars crumpled
down on the floor.Nothing daunted, the other brutes came on, and Jimmie
seized Carl’s automatic.The only question now was this:

How many bullets did the gun hold?BESIEGED IN THE TEMPLE.As Sam watched the shadow cast by the moonlight on the marble slab at
the entrance, his prisoner turned sharply about and lifted a hand as if
to shield himself from attack.“A savage!” he exclaimed in a terrified whisper.It seemed to Sam Weller at that moment that no word had ever sounded
more musically in his ears.The expression told him that a third element
had entered into the situation.He believed from recent experiences that
the savages who had been seen at the edge of the forest were not exactly
friendly to the two white men.Whether or not they would come to his
assistance was an open question, but at least there was a chance of
their creating a diversion in his favor.“How do you know the shadow is that of a savage?” asked Sam.The prisoner pointed to the wide doorway and crowded back behind his
captor.There, plainly revealed in the moonlight, were the figures of
two brawny native Indians!Felix was approaching the entrance with a
confident step, and the two watchers saw him stop for an instant and
address a few words to one of the Indians.The next moment the smile on
the fellow’s face shifted to a set expression of terror.Before he could utter another word, he received a blow on the head which
stretched him senseless on the smooth marble.Then a succession of
threatening cries came from the angle of the cliff, and half a dozen
Indians swarmed up to where the unconscious man lay!The prisoner now crouched behind his captor, his body trembling with
fear, his lips uttering almost incoherent appeals for protection.The savages glanced curiously into the temple for a moment and drew
their spears and bludgeons.He
heard blows and low hisses of enmity, but there came no outcry.When he looked again the moonlight showed a dark splotch on the white
marble, and that alone!“Mother of Mercy!” shouted the prisoner in a faltering tone.“Where did they take him?” asked Sam.The prisoner shuddered and made no reply.The mute answer, however, was
sufficient.The young man understood that Felix had been murdered by the
savages within sound of his voice.“Why?” he asked the trembling prisoner.“Because,” was the hesitating answer, “they believe that only evil
spirits come out of the sky in the night-time.”

Sam remembered of his own arrival and that of his friends, and
congratulated himself and them that the savages had not been present to
witness the event.“And they think he came in the machine?” asked Sam.The prisoner shuddered and covered his face with his hands.“And now,” demanded Sam, “in order to save your own life, will you tell
me what I want to know?”

The old sullen look returned to the eyes of the captive.Perhaps he was
thinking of the great reward he might yet receive from his distant
employers if he could escape and satisfy them that the boys had perished
in the trap set for them.At any rate he refused to answer at that time.In fact his hesitation was a brief one, for while Sam waited, a finger
upon the trigger of his automatic, two shots came from the direction of
the chamber across the corridor, and the acrid smell of gunpowder came
to his nostrils.It was undoubtedly his belief
at that time that all his hopes of making a favorable report to his
employers had vanished.The shots, he understood, indicated resistance;
perhaps successful resistance.“Yes,” he said hurriedly, his knees almost giving way under the weight
of his shaking body.“Yes, I’ll tell you where your friends are.”

He hesitated and pointed toward the opposite entrance.“In there!” he cried.“Felix caused them to be thrown to the beasts!”

The young man seized the prisoner fiercely by the throat.“Show me the way!” he demanded.The captive still pointed to the masked entrance across the corridor and
Sam drew him along, almost by main force.When they came to the narrow
passage at the eastern end of which the barred gate stood, they saw a
finger of light directed into the interior of the apartment.While they looked, Sam scarcely knowing what course to pursue, two more
shots sounded from within, and the odor of burned powder became almost
unbearable.Sam threw himself against the iron gate and shouted out:

“Jimmie!Carl!”

“Here!” cried a voice out of the smoke.“Come to the gate with your gun.I missed the last shot, and Carl is down!”

Still pushing the prisoner ahead of him, Sam crowded through the narrow
passage and stood looking over the fellow’s shoulder into the
smoke-scented room beyond.His electric light showed Jimmie standing
with his back against the gate, his feet pushed out to protect the
figure of Carl, lying on the floor against the bars.The searchlight in
the boy’s hand was waving rhythmically in the direction of a pair of
gleaming eyes which looked out of the darkness.“My gun is empty!” Jimmie almost whispered.“I’ll hold the light
straight in his eyes, and you shoot through the bars.”

Sam forced the captive down on the corridor, where he would be out of
the way and still secure from escape, and fired two shots at the
blood-mad eyes inside.The great beast fell to the floor instantly and
lay still for a small fraction of a second then leaped to his feet
again.With jaws wide open and fangs showing threateningly, he sprang toward
Jimmie, but another shot from Sam’s automatic finished the work the
others had begun.Jimmie sank to the floor like one bereft of strength.“Get us out!” he said in a weak voice.“Open the door and get us out!One of the jaguars caught hold of Carl, and I thought I heard the
crunching of bones.The boy may be dead for all I know.”

Sam applied his great strength to the barred gate, but it only shook
mockingly under his straining hands.Then he turned his face downward to
where his prisoner lay cowering upon the floor.“Can you open this gate?” he asked.Once more the fellow’s face became stubborn.“Felix had the key!” he exclaimed.“All right!” cried Sam.“We’ll send you out to Felix to get it!”

He seized the captive by the collar as he spoke and dragged him, not too
gently, through the narrow passage and out into the main corridor.Once
there he continued to force him toward the entrance.The moon was now
low in the west and shadows here and there specked the little plaza in
front of the temple.In addition to the moonlight there was a tint of
gray in the sky which told of approaching day.The prisoner faced the weird scene with an expression of absolute
terror.He almost fought his way back into the temple.“Your choice!” exclaimed Sam.“The key to the gate or you return to the
savages!”

The fellow dropped to his knees and clung to his captor.“I have the key to the gate!” he declared.“But I am not permitted to
surrender it.You must take it from me.”

“You’re loyal to some one, anyhow!” exclaimed Sam, beginning a search of
the fellow’s pockets.At last the key was found, and Sam hurried away with it.He knew then
that there would be no further necessity for guarding the prisoner at
that time.The fact that the hostile savages were abroad and that he was
without weapons would preclude any attempt at escape.At first the young man found it difficult to locate the lock to which
the key belonged.At last he found it, however, and in a moment Jimmie
crept out of the chamber, trying his best to carry Carl in his arms.Are you hurt yourself?” he
added as Jimmie leaned against the wall.“I think,” Jimmie answered, “one of the brutes gave me a nip in the leg,
but I can walk all right.”

Sam carried Carl to the center of the corridor and laid him down on the
marble floor.A quick examination showed rather a bad wound on the left
shoulder from which considerable blood must have escaped.“He’ll be all right as soon as he regains his strength!” the young man
cried.“And now, Jimmie,” he went on, “let’s see about your wound.”

“It’s only a scratch,” the boy replied, “but it bled like fury, and I
think that’s what makes me so weak.Did we get all the jaguars?” he
added, with a wan smile.“I don’t seem to remember much about the last
two or three minutes.”

“Every last one of them!” answered Sam cheerfully.While Sam was binding Carl’s wound the boy opened his eyes and looked
about the apartment whimsically.“We seem to be alive yet,” he said, rolling his eyes so as to include
Jimmie in his line of vision.“I guess Jimmie was right when he said
that Daniel in the lions’ den was nothing to this.”

“But when they took Daniel out of the lions’ den,” cut in Jimmie, “they
brought him to a place where there was something doing in the way of
sustenance!What about that?”

“Cut it out!” replied Carl feebly.“But, honestly,” Jimmie exclaimed, “I never was so hungry in my life!”

The captive looked at the two boys with amazement mixed with admiration
in his eyes.“And they’re just out of the jaws of death!” he exclaimed.“Is that the greaser that put us into the den of lions?” asked Carl,
pointing to the prisoner.“No, no!” shouted the trembling man.Felix
laid the plans for your murder.”

“The keeper of what?” asked Sam.“Of the wild animals!” was the reply.“I catch them here for the
American shows.And now they are killed!” he complained.“So that contraption, the masked entrance, the iron gate, and all that,
was arranged to hold wild animals in captivity until they could be
transferred to the coast?” asked Sam.“Exactly!” answered the prisoner.“The natives helped me catch the
jaguars and I kept them for a large payment.Then, yesterday, a runner
told me that a strange white man sought my presence in the forest at the
top of the valley.I met him there, and he arranged with
me for the use of the wild-animal cage for only one night.”

“And you knew the use to which he intended to put it?” asked Sam
angrily.“You knew that he meant murder?”

“I did not!” was the reply.“He told Miguel what to do if any of you
entered and did not tell me.I was not to enter the temple to-night!”

“And where’s Miguel?” demanded the young man.The captive pointed to the broken roof of the temple.“Miguel remained here,” he said, “to let down the gate to the passage
and lift the grate which kept the jaguars in their den.”

“Do you think he’s up there now?” asked Jimmie.“I’d like to see this
person called Miguel.I have a few words to say to him.”

“No, indeed!” answered the prisoner.He probably
took to his heels when the shots were fired.”

The prisoner, who gave his name as Pedro, insisted that he knew nothing
whatever of the purpose of the man who secured his assistance in the
desperate game which had just been played.He declared that Felix seemed
to understand perfectly that Gringoes would soon arrive in flying
machines.He said that the machines were to be wrecked, and the
occupants turned loose in the mountains.It was Pedro’s idea that two, and perhaps three, flying machines were
expected.He said that Felix had no definite idea as to when they would
arrive.He only knew that he had been stationed there to do what he
could to intercept the progress of those on the machines.He said that
the machines had been seen from a distance, and that Felix and himself
had watched the descent into the valley from a secure position in the
forest.They had remained in the forest until the Gringoes had left for
the temple, and had then set about examining the machine.While examining the machine the savages had approached and had naturally
received the impression that Felix was the Gringo who had descended in
the aeroplane.He knew some of the Indians, he said.The Indians, he said, were very superstitious, and believed that flying
machines brought death and disaster to any country they visited.By
making them trifling presents he, himself, had succeeded in keeping on
good terms with them until the machine had descended and been hidden in
the forest.“But,” the prisoner added with a significant shrug of his shoulders,
“when we walked in the direction of the temple the Indians suspected
that Felix had come to visit the evil spirits they believed to dwell
there and so got beyond control.They would kill me now as they killed
him!”

“Do the Indians never attack the temple?” asked Sam.“Perhaps,” Pedro observed, with a sly smile, “you saw the figure in
flowing robes and the red and blue lights!”

“We certainly did!” answered Sam.“While the animals are being collected and held in captivity here,”
Pedro continued, “it is necessary to do such things in order to keep the
savages away.Miguel wears the flowing robes, and drops into the narrow
entrance to an old passage when he finds it necessary to disappear.The
Indians will never actually enter the temple, though they may besiege
it.”

“There goes your ghost story!” Carl interrupted.“Why,” he added, “it’s
about the most commonplace thing I ever heard of!The haunted temple is
just headquarters for the agents of an American menagerie!”

“And all this brings up the old questions,” Jimmie said.“How did the
Redfern bunch know that any one of our airships would show up here?How
did they secure the presence of an agent so far in the interior in so
short a time?I think I’ve asked these questions before!” he added,
grinning.“But I have no recollection of their ever having been answered,” said
Sam.“Say,” questioned Jimmie, with a wink at Carl, “how long is this seance
going to last without food?I’d like to know if we’re never going to
have another breakfast.”

“There’s something to eat in the provision boxes of the _Ann_,” Sam
replied hopefully.“Yes,” said Jimmie sorrowfully, “and there’s a bunch of angry savages
between us and the grub on board the _Ann_!If you look out the door,
you’ll see the brutes inviting us to come out and be cooked!”

The prisoner threw a startled glance outside and ran to the back of the
temple, declaring that the savages were besieging the temple, and that
it might be necessary for them to lock themselves in the chamber for
days with the slain jaguars!Jimmie rubbed his stomach and groaned!On the morning following the departure of Sam and the boys, Mr.Havens
was awakened by laughing voices in the corridor outside his door.His
first impression was that Sam and Jimmie had returned from their
midnight excursion in the _Ann_.He arose and, after dressing hastily,
opened the door, thinking that the adventures of the night must have
been very amusing indeed to leave such a hang-over of merriment for the
morning.When he saw Ben and Glenn standing in the hall he confessed to a feeling
of disappointment, but invited the lads inside without showing it.“You are out early,” he said as the boys, still laughing, dropped into
chairs.“What’s the occasion of the comedy?”

“We’ve been out to the field,” replied Ben, “and we’re laughing to think
how Carl bested Sam and Jimmie last night.”

“What about it?” asked the millionaire.“Why,” Ben continued, “it seems that Sam and Jimmie planned a moonlight
ride in the _Ann_ all by themselves.Carl got next to their scheme and
bounced into the seat with Jimmie just as the machine swung into the
air.I’ll bet Jimmie was good and provoked about that!”

“What time did the _Ann_ return?” asked Havens.“She hasn’t returned yet.”

The millionaire turned from the mirror in which he was completing the
details of his toilet and faced the boys with a startled look in his
eyes.“Are you sure the boys haven’t returned?” Mr.“Anyhow,” Glenn replied, “the _Ann_ hasn’t come back!”

“Did they tell you where they were going?” asked Ben.“They did not,” was the reply.“Sam said that he thought he might be
able to pick up valuable information and asked for the use of the _Ann_
and the company of Jimmie.That’s all he said to me concerning the
moonlight ride he proposed.”

In bringing his mind back to the conversation with Sam on the previous
night, Mr.Havens could not avoid a feeling of anxiety as he considered
the significant words of the young man and the information concerning
the sealed letter to be opened only in case of his death.He said
nothing of this to the boys, however, but continued the conversation as
if no apprehension dwelt in his mind regarding the safety of the lads.“If they only went out for a short ride by moonlight,” Glenn suggested,
in a moment, “they ought to have returned before daylight.”

“You can never tell what scrape that boy Jimmie will get into!” laughed
Ben.“He’s the hoodoo of the party and the mascot combined!He gets us
into all kinds of scrapes, but he usually makes good by getting us out
of the scrapes we get ourselves into.”

“Oh, they’ll be back directly,” the millionaire remarked, although deep
down in his consciousness was a growing belief that something serious
had happened to the lads.He, however, did his best to conceal the anxiety he felt from Ben and
his companion.Directly the three went down to breakfast together, and while the meal
was in progress a report came from the field where the machines had been
left that numerous telegrams addressed to Mr.“I left positive orders at the telegraph office,” he said, “to have all
my messages delivered here.Did one of the men out there receipt for
them?If so, perhaps one of you boys would better chase out and bring
them in,” he added turning to his companions at the table.The messenger replied that the messages had been receipted for, and that
he had offered to bring them in, but that the man in charge had refused
to turn them over to him.Havens replied, “Ben will go out to the field with you
and bring the messages in.And,” he added, as the messenger turned away,
“kindly notify me the instant the _Ann_ arrives.”

The messenger bowed and started away, accompanied by Ben.“I don’t understand about the telegrams having been sent to the field,”
Mr.Havens went on, as the two left the breakfast table and sauntered
into the lobby of the hotel.I also left instructions
with the clerk to send any messages to my room, no matter what time they
came.The instructions were very explicit.”

“Oh, you know how things get balled up in telegraph offices, and
messenger offices, and post-offices!” grinned Glenn.Mellen left the office early in the evening, and the man in charge got
lazy, or indifferent, or forgetful, and sent the messages to the wrong
place.”

While the two talked together, Mr.Mellen strolled into the hotel and
approached the corner of the lobby where they sat.“Good-morning!” he said taking a chair at their side.“Anything new
concerning the southern trip?”

“Not a thing!” replied Mr.“Sam went out in the _Ann_, for a
short run last night, and we’re only waiting for his return in order to
continue our journey.We expect to be away by noon.”

“I hope I shall hear from you often,” the manager said.“By the way,” the millionaire remarked, “what about the telegrams which
were sent out to the field last night?”

“No telegrams for you were sent out to the field last night!” was the
reply.“The telegrams directed to you are now at the hotel desk, unless
you have called for them.”

“But a messenger from the field reports that several telegrams for me
were received there.I don’t understand this at all.”

“They certainly did not come from our office!” was the reply.The millionaire arose hastily and approached the desk just as the clerk
was drawing a number of telegrams from his letter-box.“I left orders to have these taken to your room as soon as they
arrived,” the clerk explained, “but it seems that the night man chucked
them into your letter-box and forgot all about them.”

Mr.Havens took the telegrams into his hand and returned to the corner
of the lobby where he had been seated with Mellen and Glenn.“There seems to be a hoodoo in the air concerning my telegrams,” he said
with a smile, as he began opening the envelopes.“The messages which
came last night were not delivered to my room, but were left lying in my
letter-box until just now.In future, please instruct your messengers,”
he said to the manager, “to bring my telegrams directly to my room—that
is,” he added, “if I remain in town and any more telegrams are received
for me.”

“I’ll see that you get them directly they are received,” replied the
manager, impatiently.“If the hotel clerk objects to the boy going to
your room in the night-time, I’ll tell him to draw a gun on him!” he
added with a laugh.“Are the delayed telegrams important ones?”

“They are in code!” replied the millionaire.“I’m afraid I’ll have to go
to my room and get the code sheet.”

Mr.Havens disappeared up the elevator, and Mellen and Glenn talked of
aviation, and canoeing, and base-ball, and the dozen and one things in
which men and boys are interested, for half an hour.Then the
millionaire appeared in the lobby beckoning them toward the elevator.Mellen observed that the millionaire was greatly excited as he
motioned them into his suite of rooms and pointed to chairs.The
telegrams which he had received were lying open on a table near the
window and the code sheet and code translations were not far away.Before the millionaire could open the conversation Ben came bounding
into the room without knocking.His face was flushed with running, and
his breath came in short gasps.As he turned to close the door he shook
a clenched fist threateningly in the direction of the elevator.“That fool operator,” he declared, “left me standing in the corridor
below while he took one of the maids up to the ’steenth floor, and I ran
all the way up the stairs!I’ll get him good sometime!”

“Did you bring the telegrams?” asked the millionaire with a smile.“Say, look here!” Ben exclaimed dropping into a chair beside the table.“I’d like to know what’s coming off!”

Mr.Havens and his companions regarded the boy critically for a moment
and then the millionaire asked:

“What’s broke loose now?”

“Well,” Ben went on, “I went out to the field and the man there said
he’d get the telegrams in a minute.I stood around looking over the
_Louise_ and _Bertha_, and asking questions about what Sam said when he
went away on the _Ann_, until I got tired of waiting, then I chased up
to where this fellow stood and he said he’d go right off and get the
messages.”

“Why didn’t you hand him one?” laughed Glenn.“I wanted to,” Ben answered.“If I’d had him down in the old seventeenth
ward in the little old city of New York, I’d have set the bunch on him.Well, after a while, he poked away to the little shelter-tent the men
put up to sleep in last night and rustled around among the straw and
blankets and came back and said he couldn’t find the messages.”

The millionaire and the manager exchanged significant glances.“He told me,” Ben went on, “that the telegrams had been receipted for
and hidden under a blanket, to be delivered early in the morning.Said
he guessed some one must have stolen them, or mislaid them, but didn’t
seem to think the matter very important.”

The millionaire pointed to the open messages lying on the table.“How many telegrams came for me last night?” he asked.“Eight,” was the reply.“And there are eight here,” the millionaire went on.“And that means——”

“And that means,” the millionaire said, interrupting the manager, “that
the telegrams delivered on the field last night were either duplicates
of these cipher despatches or fake messages!”

“That’s just what I was going to remark,” said Mellen.“Has the _Ann_ returned?” asked Glenn of Ben.“Not yet,” was the reply.“Suppose we take one of the other machines and go up and look for her?”

“We’ll discuss that later on, boys,” the millionaire interrupted.“I would give a considerable to know,” the manager observed, in a
moment, “just who handled the messages which were left at the hotel
counter last night.And I’m going to do my best to find out!” he added.“That ought to be a perfectly simple matter,” suggested Mr.In Quito, no!” answered the manager.“A good many of
the natives who are in clerical positions here are crooked enough to
live in a corkscrew.They’ll do almost anything for money.”

“That’s the idea I had already formed of the people,” Ben cut in.“Besides,” the manager continued, “the chances are that the night clerk
tumbled down on a sofa somewhere in the lobby and slept most of the
night, leaving bell-boys and subordinates to run the hotel.”

“In that event,” Mr.Havens said, “the telegrams might have been handled
by half a dozen different people.”

“I’m afraid so!” replied the manager.“But the code!” suggested Ben.“They couldn’t read them!”

“But they might copy them for some one who could!” argued the manager.“And the copies might have been sent out to the field for the express
purpose of having them stolen,” he went on with an anxious look on his
face.“Are they very important?” he asked of the millionaire.“Very much so,” was the answer.“In fact, they are code copies of
private papers taken from deposit box A, showing the plans made in New
York for the South American aeroplane journey.”

“And showing stops and places to look through and all that?” asked Ben.“If that’s the kind of information the telegrams contained, I guess the
Redfern bunch in this vicinity are pretty well posted about this time!”

“I’m afraid so,” the millionaire replied gloomily.“Well,” he continued
in a moment, “we may as well get ready for our journey.I remember now,”
he said casually, “that Sam said last night that we ought to proceed on
our way without reference to him this morning.His idea then was that we
would come up with him somewhere between Quito and Lake Titicaca.So we
may as well be moving, and leave the investigation of the fraudulent or
copied telegrams to Mr.Mellen.”

“Funny thing for them to go chasing off in that way!” declared Ben.But no one guessed the future as the aeroplanes started southward!JIMMIE’S AWFUL HUNGER.“You say,” Sam asked, as Pedro crouched in the corner of the temple
where the old fountain basin had been, “that the Indians will never
actually attack the temple?”

“They never have,” replied Pedro, his teeth chattering in terror.“Since
I have been stationed here to feed and care for the wild animals in
captivity, I have known them to utter threats, but until to-night, so
far as I know, none of them ever placed a foot on the temple steps.”

“They did it to-night, all right!” Jimmie declared.“Felix could tell us about that if they had left enough of his frame to
utter a sound!” Carl put in.The boys were both weak from loss of blood, but their injuries were not
of a character to render them incapable of moving about.“What I’m afraid of,” Pedro went on, “is that they’ll surround the
temple and try to starve us into submission.”

“Jerusalem!” cried Jimmie.“That doesn’t sound good to me.I’m so hungry
now I could eat one of those jaguars raw!”

“But they are not fit to eat!” exclaimed Pedro.“They wanted to eat us, didn’t they?” demanded Jimmie.“I guess turn and
turn about is fair play!”

“Is there no secret way out of this place?” asked Sam, as the howls of
the savages became more imperative.There were rumors, he said, of secret
passages, but he had never been able to discover them.For his own part,
he did not believe they existed.“What sort of a hole is that den the jaguars came out of?” asked Jimmie.“It looks like it might extend a long way into the earth.”

“No,” answered Pedro, “it is only a subterranean room, used a thousand
years ago by the priests who performed at the broken altar you see
beyond the fountain.When the Gringoes came with their proposition to
hold wild animals here until they could be taken out to Caxamarca, and
thence down the railroad to the coast, they examined the walls of the
chamber closely, but found no opening by which the wild beasts might
escape.Therefore, I say, there is no passage leading from that
chamber.”

“From the looks of things,” Carl said, glancing out at the Indians, now
swarming by the score on the level plateau between the front of the
ruined temple and the lake, “we’ll have plenty of time to investigate
this old temple before we get out of it.”

“How are we going to investigate anything when we’re hungry?” demanded
Jimmie.“I can’t even think when I’m hungry.”

“Take away Jimmie’s appetite,” grinned Carl, “and there wouldn’t be
enough left of him to fill an ounce bottle!”

Pedro still sat in the basin of the old fountain, rocking his body back
and forth and wailing in a mixture of Spanish and English that he was
the most unfortunate man who ever drew the breath of life.“The animal industry,” he wailed, “is ruined.No more will the hunters
of wild beasts bring them to this place for safe keeping.No more will
the Indians assist in their capture.No more will the gold of the Gringo
kiss my palm.The ships came out of the sky and brought ruin.Right the
Indians are when they declare that the men who fly bring only disease
and disaster!” he continued, with an angry glance directed at the boys.“Cheer up!” laughed Jimmie.“Cheer up, old top, and remember that the
worst is yet to come!Say!” the boy added in a moment.“How would it do
to step out to the entrance and shoot a couple of those noisy savages?”

“I never learned how to shoot with an empty gun!” Carl said scornfully.“How many cartridges have you in your gun?” asked Jimmie of Sam.“About six,” was the reply.“I used two out of the clip on the jaguars
and two were fired on the ride to Quito.”

“And that’s all the ammunition we’ve got, is it?” demanded Carl.“That’s all we’ve got here!” answered Sam.“There’s plenty more at the
machine if the Indians haven’t taken possession of it.”

“Little good that does us!” growled Jimmie.“You couldn’t eat ’em!” laughed Carl.“But I’ll tell you what I could do!” insisted Jimmie.“If we had plenty
of ammunition, I could make a sneak outside and bring in game enough to
keep us eating for a month.”

“You know what always happens to you when you go out after something to
eat!” laughed Carl.“You always get into trouble!”

“But I always get back, don’t I?” demanded Jimmie.“I guess the time
will come, before long, when you’ll be glad to see me starting out for
some kind of game!We’re not going to remain quietly here and starve.”

“That looks like going out hunting,” said Sam, pointing to the savages
outside.“Those fellows might have something to say about it.”

It was now broad daylight.The early sunshine lay like a mist of gold
over the tops of the distant peaks, and birds were cutting the clear,
sweet air with their sharp cries.Many of the Indians outside being sun
worshipers, the boys saw them still on their knees with hands and face
uplifted to the sunrise.The air in the valley was growing warmer every minute.By noon, when the
sun would look almost vertically down, it promised to be very hot, as
the mountains shut out the breeze.“I don’t think it will be necessary to look for game,” Sam went on in a
moment, “for the reason that the _Louise_ and _Bertha_, ought to be here
soon after sunset.It may possibly take them a little longer than that
to cover the distance, as they do not sail so fast as the _Ann_, but at
least they should be here before to-morrow morning.Then you’ll see the
savages scatter!” he added with a smile.“And you’ll see Jimmie eat,
too!”

“Don’t mention it!” cried the boy.“Yes,” Carl suggested, “but won’t Mr.Havens and the boys remain in
Quito two or three days waiting for us to come back?”

“I think not,” was the reply.Havens to pick us up
somewhere between Quito and Lake Titicaca in case we did not return
before morning.I have an idea that they’ll start out sometime during
the forenoon—say ten o’clock—and reach this point, at the latest, by
midnight.”

“They can’t begin to sail as fast as we did!” suggested Carl.“If they make forty miles an hour,” Sam explained, “and stop only three
or four times to rest, they can get here before midnight, all right!”

“Gee!That’s a long time to go without eating!” cried Jimmie.“And, even
at that,” he went on in a moment, “they may shoot over us like a couple
of express trains, and go on south without ever knowing we are here.”

Sam turned to Pedro with an inquiring look on his face.“Where is Miguel?” he asked.“Gone!” he said.“Well, then,” Sam went on, “what about the red and blue lights?Can you
stage that little drama for us to-night?”

“What is stage?” demanded Pedro.“I don’t know what you mean.”

“Chestnuts!” exclaimed Jimmie impatiently.“He wants to know if you can
work the lights as Miguel did.He wants to know if you can keep the
lights burning to-night in order to attract the attention of people who
are coming to drive the Indians away.Do you get it?”

Pedro’s face brightened perceptibly.“Coming to drive the Indians away?” he repeated.“Yes, I can burn the
lights.They shall burn from the going down of the sun.Also,” he added
with a hopeful expression on his face, “the Indians may see the lights
and disappear again in the forest.”

“Yes, they will!” laughed Carl.“Let him think so if he wants to,” cautioned Jimmie.“He’ll take better
care of the lights if he thinks that will in any way add to the
possibility of release.But midnight!” the boy went on.“Think of all
that time without anything to eat!Say,” he whispered to Carl, in a soft
aside, “if you can get Sam asleep sometime during the day and get the
gun away from him, I’m going to make a break for the tall timber and
bring in a deer, or a brace of rabbits, or something of that kind.There’s plenty of cooking utensils in that other chamber and plenty of
dishes, so we can have a mountain stew with very little trouble if we
can only get the meat to put into it.”

“And there’s the stew they left,” suggested Carl.“Not for me!” Jimmie answered.“I’m not going to take any chances on
being poisoned.I’d rather build a fire on that dizzy old hearth they
used, and broil a steak from one of the jaguars than eat that stew—or
anything they left for that matter.”

“I don’t believe you can get out into the hills,” objected Carl.“I can try,” Jimmie suggested, “if I can only get that gun away from
Sam.Look here,” he went
on, “suppose I fix up in the long, flowing robe, and dig up the wigs and
things Miguel must have worn, and walk in a dignified manner between the
ranks of the Indians?What do you know about that?”

“That would probably be all right,” Carl answered, “until you began
shooting game, and then they’d just naturally put you into a stew.They
know very well that gods in white robes don’t have to kill game in order
to sustain life.”

“Oh, why didn’t you let me dream?” demanded Jimmie.“I was just figuring
how I could get about four gallons of stew.”

Abandoning the cherished hope of getting out into the forest for the
time being, Jimmie now approached Pedro and began asking him questions
concerning his own stock of provisions.“According to your own account,” the boy said, “you’ve been living here
right along for some weeks, taking care of the wild animals as the
collectors brought them in.Now you must have plenty of provisions
stored away somewhere.Dig ’em up!”

Pedro declared that there were no provisions at all about the place,
adding that everything had been consumed the previous day except the
remnants left in the living chamber.He said, however, that he expected
provisions to be brought in by his two companions within two days.In
the meantime, he had arranged on such wild game as he could bring down.Abandoning another hope, Jimmie passed through the narrow passage and
into the chamber where he had come so near to death.The round eye of
his searchlight revealed the jaguars still lying on the marble floor.The roof above this chamber appeared to be comparatively whole, yet here
and there the warm sunlight streamed in through minute crevices between
the slabs.The boy crossed the chamber, not without a little shiver of
terror at the thought of the dangers he had met there, and peered into
the mouth of the den from which the wild beasts had made their
appearance.The odor emanating from the room beyond was not at all pleasant, but,
resolving to see for himself what the place contained, he pushed on and
soon stood in a subterranean room hardly more than twelve feet square.There were six steps leading down into the chamber, and these seemed to
the boy to be worn and polished smooth as if from long use.“It’s a bet!” the lad chuckled, as he crawled through the opening and
slid cautiously down the steps, “that this stairway was used a hundred
times a day while the old priests lived here.In that case,” he argued,
“there must have been some reason for constant use of the room.And all
this,” he went on, “leads me to the conclusion that the old fellows had
a secret way out of the temple and that it opens from this very room.”

While the boy stood at the bottom of the steps flashing his light around
the confined space, Carl’s figure appeared into the opening above.“What have you found?” the latter asked.“Nothing yet but bad air and stone walls!” replied Jimmie.“What are you looking for?” was the next question.“A way out!” answered Jimmie.Carl came down the steps and the two boys examined the chamber carefully
for some evidence of a hidden exit.They were about to abandon the quest
when Jimmie struck the handle of his pocket knife, which he had been
using in the investigation, against a stone which gave back a hollow
sound.“Here you are!” Jimmie cried.“There’s a hole back of that stone.If we
can only get it out, we’ll kiss the savages ‘good-bye’ and get back to
the _Ann_ in quick time.”

The boys pried and pounded at the stone until at last it gave way under
pressure and fell backward with a crash.“There!” Jimmie shouted.“I knew it!”




                              CHAPTER XIX.“Yes, you knew it all right!” Carl exclaimed, as the boy stood looking
into the dark passage revealed by the falling of the stone.“You always
know a lot of things just after they occur!”

“Anyway,” Jimmie answered with a grin, “I knew there ought to be a
secret passage somewhere.Where do you suppose the old thing leads to?”

“For one thing,” Carl answered, “it probably leads under the great stone
slab in front of the entrance, because when Miguel, the foxy boy with
the red and blue lights, disappeared he went down into the ground right
there.And I’ll bet,” he went on, “that it runs out to the rocky
elevation to the west and connects with the forest near where the
machine is.”

“Those old chaps must have burrowed like rabbits!” declared Jimmie.“Don’t you think the men who operated the temples ever carried the
stones which weigh a hundred tons or cut passages through solid rocks!”
Carl declared.“They worked the Indians for all that part of the game,
just as the Egyptians worked the Hebrews on the lower Nile.”

“Well, the only way to find out where it goes,” Jimmie suggested, “is to
follow it.We can’t stand here and guess it out.”

“Indeed we can’t,” agreed Carl.“I’ll go on down the incline and you
follow along.Looks pretty slippery here, so we’d better keep close
together.I don’t suppose we can put the stone back,” he added with a
parting glance into the chamber.“What would we want to put it back for?” demanded Jimmie.“How do we know who will be snooping around here while we are under
ground?” Carl asked impatiently.“If some one should come along here and
stuff the stone back into the hole and we shouldn’t be able to find any
exit, we’d be in a nice little tight box, wouldn’t we?”

“Well, if we can’t lift it back into the hole,” Jimmie argued, “I guess
we can push it along in front of us.This incline seems slippery enough
to pass it along like a sleighload of girls on a snowy hill.”

The boys concentrated their strength, which was not very great at that
time because of their wounds, on the stone and were soon gratified to
see it sliding swiftly out of sight along a dark incline.“I wonder what Sam will say?” asked Jimmie.“He won’t know anything about it!” Carl declared.“Oh, yes, he will!” asserted Jimmie, “he’ll be looking around before
we’ve been absent ten minutes.Perhaps we’d ought to go back and tell
him what we’ve found, and what we’re going to do.”

“Then he’d want to go with us,” Carl suggested, “and that would leave
the savages to sneak into the temple whenever they find the nerve to do
so, and also leave Pedro to work any old tricks he saw fit.Besides,”
the boy went on, “we won’t be gone more than ten minutes.”

“You’re always making a sneak on somebody,” grinned Jimmie.“You had to
go and climb up on our machine last night, and get mixed up in all this
trouble.You’re always doing something of the kind!”

“I guess you’re glad I stuck around, ain’t you?” laughed Carl.“You’d
’a’ had a nice time in that den of lions without my gun, eh?”

“Well, get a move on!” laughed Jimmie.“And hang on to the walls as you
go ahead.This floor looks like one of the chutes under the newspaper
offices in New York.And hold your light straight ahead.”

The incline extended only a few yards.Arrived at the bottom, the boys
estimated that the top of the six-foot passage was not more than a
couple of yards from the surface of the earth.Much to their surprise
they found the air in the place remarkably pure.At the bottom of the incline the passage turned away to the north for a
few paces, then struck out west.From this angle the boys could see
little fingers of light which probably penetrated into the passage from
crevices in the steps of the temple.Gaining the front of the old structure, they saw that one of the stones
just below the steps was hung on a rude though perfectly reliable hinge,
and that a steel rod attached to it operated a mechanism which placed
the slab entirely under the control of any one mounting the steps, if
acquainted with the secret of the door.“Here’s where Miguel drops down!” laughed Jimmie, his searchlight prying
into the details of the cunning device.“Well, well!” he went on, “those
old Incas certainly took good care of their precious carcasses.It’s a
pity they couldn’t have coaxed the Spaniards into some of their secret
passages and then sealed them up!”

The passage ran on to the west after passing the temple for some
distance, and then turned abruptly to the north.The lights showed a
long, tunnel-like place, apparently cut in the solid rock.“I wonder if this tunnel leads to the woods we saw at the west of the
cove,” Carl asked.“I hope it does!” he added, “for then we can get to
the machine and get something to eat and get some ammunition and,” he
added hopefully, “we may be able to get away in the jolly old _Ann_ and
leave the Indians watching an empty temple.”

“Do you suppose Miguel came into this passage when he dropped out of
sight in front of the temple?” asked Jimmie.“Of course, he did!”

“Then where did he go?”

“Why, back into the temple.”

“Through the den of lions?I guess not!”

“That’s a fact!” exclaimed Carl.“He wouldn’t go through the den of
lions, would he?And he never could have traveled this passage to the
end and hiked back over the country in time to drop the gate and lift
the bars in front of the den!It was Miguel that did that, wasn’t it?”
the boy added, turning enquiringly to his chum.“It must have been for
there was no one else there.”

“What are you getting at?” asked Jimmie.“There must be a passage leading from this one
back into the temple on the west side.It may enter the room where the
bunks are, or it may come into the corridor back by the fountain, but
there’s one somewhere all right.”

“You’re the wise little boy!” laughed Jimmie.“Let’s go and see.”

The boys returned to the trap-like slab in front of the temple and from
that point examined every inch of the south wall for a long distance.Finally a push on a stone brought forth a grinding noise, and then a
passage similar to that discovered in the den was revealed.“There you are!” said Carl.“There’s the passage that leads to the west
side of the temple.Shall we go on in and give Sam and Pedro the merry
ha, ha?Mighty funny,” he added, without waiting for his question to be
answered, “that all these trap doors are so easily found and work so
readily.They’re just about as easy to manipulate as one of the foolish
houses we see on the stage.It’s no trick to operate them at all.”

“Well,” Jimmie argued, “these passages and traps are doubtless used
every day by a man who don’t take any precautions about keeping them
hidden.I presume Miguel is the only person here who knows of their
existence, and he just slams around in them sort of careless-like.”

“That’s the answer!” replied Carl.“Let’s chase along and see where the
tunnel ends, and then get back to Sam.He may be crying his eyes out for
our polite society right now!”

The boys followed the tunnel for what seemed to them to be a long
distance.At length they came to a turn from which a mist of daylight
could be seen.In five minutes more they stood looking out into the
forest.The entrance to the passage was concealed only by carelessly heaped-up
rocks, between the interstices of which grew creeping vines and
brambles.Looking from the forest side, the place resembled a heap of
rocks, probably inhabited by all manner of creeping things and covered
over with vines.As the boys peered out between the vines, Jimmie nudged his chum in the
side and whispered as he pointed straight out:

“There’s the _Ann_.”

“But that isn’t where we left her!” argued Carl.“Well, it’s the _Ann_, just the same, isn’t it?”

“I suppose so,” was the reply.“I presume,” the boy went on, “the
Indians moved it to the place where it now is.”

“Don’t you ever think they did!” answered Jimmie.“The Indians wouldn’t
touch it with a pair of tongs!Felix and Pedro probably moved it, the
idea being to hide it from view.”

“I guess that’s right!” Carl agreed.“I’m going out,” he continued, in a
moment, “and see if I can find any savages.I won’t be gone very long.”

“What you mean,” Jimmie grinned, “is that you’re going out to see if you
won’t find any savages.That is,” he went on, “you think of going out.As a matter of fact, I’m the one that’s going out, because the wild
beasts chewed you up proper, and they didn’t hurt me at all.”

The boy crowded past Carl as he spoke and dodged out into the forest.Carl waited impatiently for ten minutes and was on the point of going in
quest of the boy when Jimmie came leisurely up to the curtain of vines
which hid the passage and looked in with a grin on his freckled face.“Come on out,” he said, “the air is fine!”

“Any savages?” asked Carl.“Not a savage!”

“Anything to eat?” demanded the boy.“Bales of it!” answered Jimmie.“The savages never touched the _Ann_.”

Carl crept out of the opening and made his way to where Jimmie sat flat
on the bole of a fallen tree eating ham sandwiches.“Are there any left?” he asked.“Half a bushel!”

“Then perhaps the others stand some chance of getting one or two.”

“There’s more than we can all eat before to-morrow morning,” Jimmie
answered.“And if the relief train doesn’t come before that time we’ll
mount the _Ann_ and glide away.”

While the boys sat eating their sandwiches and enjoying the clear sweet
air of the morning, there came an especially savage chorus of yells from
the direction of the temple.“The Indians seem to be a mighty enthusiastic race!” declared Jimmie.“Suppose we go to the _Ann_, grab the provisions, and go back to the
temple just to see what they’re amusing themselves with now!”

This suggestion meeting with favor, the boys proceeded to the aeroplane
which was only a short distance away and loaded themselves down with
provisions and cartridges.During their journey they saw not the
slightest indications of the Indians.It was quite evident that they
were all occupied with the _siege_ of the temple.On leaving the entrance, the boys restored the vines so far as possible
to their original condition and filled their automatics with cartridges.“No one will ever catch me without cartridges again,” Carl declared as
he patted his weapon.“The idea of getting into a den of lions with only
four shots between us and destruction!”

“Well, hurry up!” cried Jimmie.“I know from the accent the Indians
placed on the last syllable that there’s something doing at the temple.And Sam, you know, hasn’t got many cartridges.”

“I wouldn’t run very fast,” declared Carl, “if I knew that the Indians
had captured Miguel.That’s the ruffian who shut us into the den of
lions!”

When the boys came to the passage opening from the tunnel on the west of
the temple, they turned into it and proceeded a few yards south.Here
they found an opening which led undoubtedly directly to the rear of the
corridor in the vicinity of the fountain.The stone which had in past years concealed the mouth of this passage
had evidently not been used for a long time, for it lay broken into
fragments on the stone floor.When the boys came to the end of the passage, they saw by the slices of
light which lay between the stones that they were facing the corridor
from the rear.They knew well enough that somewhere in that vicinity was
a door opening into the temple, but for some moments they could not find
it.At last Jimmie, prying into a crack with his knife, struck a piece
of metal and the stone dropped backward.He was about to crawl through into the corridor when Carl caught him by
one leg and held him back.It took the lad only an instant to comprehend
what was going on.A horde of savages was crowding up the steps and into
the temple itself, and Sam stood in the middle of the corridor with a
smoking weapon in his hand.As the boys looked he threw the automatic into the faces of the
onrushing crowd as if its usefulness had departed.THE SAVAGES MAKE MORE TROUBLE.“Pedro said the savages wouldn’t dare enter the temple!” declared Jimmie
as he drew back.Without stopping to comment on the situation, Carl called out:

“Drop, Sam, drop!”

The young man whirled about, saw the opening in the rear wall, saw the
brown barrels of the automatics, and instantly dropped to the floor.The
Indians advanced no farther, for in less time than it takes to say the
words a rain of bullets struck into their ranks.Half a dozen fell to
the floor and the others retreated, sneaking back in a minute, however,
to remove the bodies of their dead and wounded companions.The boys did not fire while this duty was being performed.In a minute from the time of the opening of the stone panel in the wall
there was not a savage in sight.Only for the smears of blood on the
white marble floor, and on the steps outside, no one would have imagined
that so great a tragedy had been enacted there only a few moments
before.Sam rose slowly to his feet and stood by the boys as they
crawled out of the narrow opening just above the basin of the fountain.“I’m glad to see you, kids,” he said, in a matter-of-fact tone, although
his face was white to the lips.“You came just in time!”

“We usually do arrive on schedule,” Jimmie grinned, trying to make as
little as possible of the rescue.“You did this time at any rate!” replied Sam.“But, look here,” he went
on, glancing at the automatics in their hands, “I thought the ammunition
was all used up in the den of lions.”

“We got some more!” laughed Carl.“More—where?”

“At the _Ann_!”

Sam leaned back against the wall, a picture of amazement.“You haven’t been out to the _Ann_ have you?” he asked.For reply Jimmie drew a great package of sandwiches and another of
cartridges out of the opening in the wall.“We haven’t, eh?” he laughed.“That certainly looks like it!” declared Sam.The boys briefly related the story of their visit to the aeroplane while
Sam busied himself with the sandwiches, and then they loaded the three
automatics and distributed the remaining clips about their persons.“And now what?” asked Carl, after the completion of the recital.“Are we going to take the _Ann_ and slip away from these worshipers of
the Sun?” asked Jimmie.“We can do it all right!”

“I don’t know about that,” argued Sam.“You drove them away from the
temple, and the chances are that they will return to the forest and will
remain there until they get the courage to make another attack on us.”

“It won’t take long to go and find out whether they are in the forest or
not!” Carl declared.“Perhaps,” Sam suggested, “we’d better wait here for the others to come
up.They ought to be here to-night.”

“If it’s a sure thing that we can let them know where we are,” Carl
agreed, “that might be all right.”

“What’s the matter with the red and blue lights?” asked Jimmie.“By the way,” Carl inquired looking about the place, “where is Pedro?”

“He took to his heels when the savages made the rush.”

“Which way did he go?” asked Jimmie.“I think he went in the direction of that little menagerie you boys
found last night!” replied Sam.“Then I’ll bet he knows where the tunnel is!” Carl shouted, dashing
away.“I’ll bet he’s lit out for the purpose of bringing a lot of his
conspirators in here to do us up!”

Jimmie followed his chum, and the two searched the entire system of
tunnels known to them without discovering any trace of the missing man.“That’s a nice thing!” Jimmie declared.“We probably passed him
somewhere on our way back to the temple.By this time he’s off over the
hills, making signals for some one to come and help put us to the bad.”

“I’m afraid you’re right!” replied Sam.The boys ate their sandwiches and discussed plans and prospects,
listening in the meantime for indications of the two missing men.Several times they thought they heard soft footsteps in the apartments
opening from the corridor, but in each case investigation revealed
nothing.It was a long afternoon, but finally the sun disappeared over the ridge
to the west of the little lake and the boys began considering the
advisability of making ready to signal to the _Louise_ and _Bertha_.“They will surely be here?” said Carl hopefully.“I am certain of it!” answered Sam.“Then we’d better be getting something on top of the temple to make a
light,” advised Jimmie.“If I had Miguel by the neck, he’d bring out his
red and blue lights before he took another breath!” he added.“Perhaps we can find the lights,” suggested Sam.This idea being very much to the point, the boys scattered themselves
over the three apartments and searched diligently for the lamps or
candles which had been used by Miguel on the previous night.“Nothing doing!” Jimmie declared, returning to the corridor.“Nothing doing!” echoed Carl, coming in from the other way.Sam joined the group in a moment looking very much discouraged.“Boys,” he said, “I’ve been broke in nearly all the large cities on both
Western continents.I’ve been kicked out of lodging houses, and I’ve
walked hundreds of miles with broken shoes and little to eat, but of all
the everlasting, consarned, ridiculous, propositions I ever butted up
against, this is the worst!”

The boys chuckled softly but made no reply.“We know well enough,” he went on, “that there are rockets, or lamps, or
torches, or candles, enough hidden about this place to signal all the
transcontinental trains in the world but we can’t find enough of them to
flag a hand-car on an uphill grade!”

“What’s the matter with the searchlights?” asked Jimmie.“Not sufficiently strong!”

Without any explanation, Jimmie darted away from the group and began a
tour of the temple.First he walked along the walls of the corridor then
darted to the other room, then out on the steps in front.“His trouble has turned his head!” jeered Carl.“Look here, you fellows!” Jimmie answered darting back into the temple.“There’s a great white rock on the cliff back of the temple.It looks
like one of these memorial stones aldermen put their names on when they
build a city hall.All we have to do to signal the aeroplanes is to put
red caps over our searchlights and turn them on that cliff.They will
make a circle of fire there that will look like the round, red face of a
harvest moon.”

“That’s right!” agreed Carl.“A very good idea!” Sam added.“I’ve been trying to find a way to get up on the roof,” Jimmie
continued, “but can’t find one.You see,” he went on, “we can operate
our searchlights better from the top of the temple.”

“We’ll have to find a way to get up there!” Sam insisted.“Unless we can make the illumination on the cliff through the hole in
the roof,” Jimmie proposed.“And that’s another good proposition!” Sam agreed.“And so,” laughed Carl, “the stage is set and the actors are in the
wings, and I’m going to crawl into one of the bunks in the west room and
go to sleep.”

“You go, too, Jimmie,” Sam advised.“I’ll wake you up if anything
happens.I can get my rest later on.”

The boys were not slow in accepting the invitation, and in a very short
time were sound asleep.It would be time for the _Bertha_ and _Louise_
to show directly, and so Sam placed the red caps over the lamps of two
of the electrics and sat where he could throw the rays through the break
in the roof.Curious to know if the result was exactly as he
anticipated, he finally propped one of the lights in position on the
floor and went out to the entrance to look up at the rock.As he stepped out on the smooth slab of marble in front of the entrance
something whizzed within an inch of his head and dropped with a crash on
the stones below.Without stopping to investigate the young man dodged
into the temple again and looked out.“Now, I wonder,” he thought, as he lifted the electric so that its red
light struck the smooth face of the rock above more directly, “whether
that kind remembrance was from our esteemed friends Pedro and Miguel, or
whether it came from the Indians.”

He listened intently for a moment and presently heard the sound of
shuffling feet from above.It was apparent that the remainder of the
evening was not to be as peaceful and quiet as he had anticipated.Realizing that the hostile person or persons on the roof might in a
moment begin dropping their rocks down to the floor of the corridor, he
passed hastily into the west chamber and stood by the doorway looking
out.This interference, he understood, would effectually prevent any
illumination of the white rock calculated to serve as a signal to Mr.Some other means of attracting their attention must
be devised.The corridor lay dim in the faint light of the stars which
came through the break in the roof, and he threw the light of his
electric up and down the stone floor in order to make sure that the
enemy was not actually creeping into the temple from the entrance.While he stood flashing the light about he almost uttered an exclamation
of fright as a grating sound in the vicinity of the fountain came to his
ears.He cast his light in that direction and saw the stone which had
been replaced by the boys retreating slowly into the wall.Then a dusky face looked out of the opening, and, without considering
the ultimate consequences of his act, he fired full at the threatening
eyes which were searching the interior.There was a groan, a fall, and
the stone moved back to its former position.He turned to awaken Jimmie and Carl but the sound of the shot had
already accomplished that, and the boys were standing in the middle of
the floor with automatics in their hands.“What’s coming off?” asked Jimmie.“Was that thunder?” demanded Carl.“Thunder don’t smell like that,” suggested Jimmie, sniffing at the
powder smoke.“I guess Sam has been having company.”

“Right you are,” said Sam, doing his best to keep the note of
apprehension out of his voice.“Our friends are now occupying the tunnel
you told me about.At least one of them was, not long ago.”

“Now, see here,” Jimmie broke in, “I’m getting tired of this
hide-and-seek business around this blooming old ruin.We came out to
sail in the air, and not crawl like snakes through underground
passages.”

“What’s the answer?” asked Carl.“According to Sam’s story,” Jimmie went on, “we won’t be able to signal
our friends with our red lights to-night.In that case, they’re likely
to fly by, on their way south, without discovering our whereabouts.”

“And so you want to go back to the machine, eh?” Sam questioned.“That’s the idea,” answered Jimmie.“I want to get up into God’s free
air again, where I can see the stars, and the snow caps on the
mountains!I want to build a roaring old fire on some shelf of rock and
build up a stew big enough for a regiment of state troops!Then I want
to roll up in a blanket and sleep for about a week.”

“That’s me, too!” declared Carl.“It may not be possible to get to the machine,” suggested Sam.“I’ll let you know in about five minutes!” exclaimed Jimmie darting
recklessly across the corridor and into the chamber which had by mutual
consent been named the den of lions.Sam called to him to return but the boy paid no heed to the warning.“Come on!” Carl urged the next moment.“We’ve got to go with him.”

Sam seized a package of sandwiches which lay on the roughly constructed
table and darted with the boy across the corridor, through the east
chamber, into the subterranean one, and passed into the tunnel, the
entrance to which, it will be remembered, had been left open.Some distance down in the darkness, probably where the passage swung
away to the north, they saw a glimmer of light.Directly they heard
Jimmie’s voice calling softly through the odorous darkness.“Come on!” he whispered.“We may as well get out to the woods and see
what’s doing there.”

The two half-walked, half-stumbled, down the slippery incline and joined
Jimmie at the bottom.“Now we want to look out,” the boy said as they came to the angle which
faced the west.“There may be some of those rude persons in the tunnel
ahead of us.”

Not caring to proceed in the darkness, they kept their lights burning as
they advanced.When they came to the cross passage which led to the rear
of the corridor they listened for an instant and thought they detected a
low murmur of voices in the distance.“Let’s investigate!” suggested Carl.“Investigate nothing!” replied Jimmie.“Let’s move for the machine and
the level of the stars.If the savages are there, we’ll chase ’em out.”

But the savages were not there.When the three came to the curtain of
vines which concealed the entrance to the passage, the forest seemed as
still as it had been on the day of creation.They moved out of the tangle and crept forward to the aeroplane, their
lights now out entirely, and their automatics ready for use.They were
soon at the side of the machine.After as good an examination as could possibly be made in the
semi-darkness, Sam declared that nothing had been molested, and that the
_Ann_ was, apparently, in as good condition for flight as it had been at
the moment of landing.“Why didn’t we do this in the afternoon, while the <DW65>s were out of
sight?” asked Carl in disgust.“Sam said we couldn’t!” grinned Jimmie.“Anyhow,” Sam declared, “we’re going to see right now whether we can or
not.We’ll have to push the old bird out into a clear place first,
though!”

Here the talk was interrupted by a chorus of savage shouts.The _Louise_ and the _Bertha_ left the field near Quito amid the shouts
of a vast crowd which gathered in the early part of the day.As the
aeroplanes sailed majestically into the air, Mr.Havens saw Mellen
sitting in a motor-car waving a white handkerchief in farewell.The millionaire and Ben rode in the _Louise_, while Glenn followed in
the _Bertha_.For a few moments the clatter of the motors precluded
conversation, then the aviator slowed down a trifle and asked his
companion:

“Was anything seen of Doran to-day?”

Ben shook his head.“I half believe,” Mr.Havens continued, “that the code despatches were
stolen by him last night from the hotel, copied, and the copies sent out
to the field to be delivered to some one of the conspirators.”

“But no one could translate them,” suggested Ben.“I’m not so sure of that,” was the reply.“The code is by no means a new
one.I have often reproached myself for not changing it after Redfern
disappeared with the money.”

“If it’s the same code you used then,” Ben argued, “you may be sure
there is some one of the conspirators who can do the translating.Why,”
he went on, “there must be.They wouldn’t have stolen code despatches
unless they knew how to read them.”

“In that case,” smiled Mr.Havens grimly, “they have actually secured
the information they desire from the men they are fighting.”

“Were the messages important?” asked Ben.“Duplicates of papers contained in deposit box A,” was the answer.“What can they learn from them?”

“The route mapped out for our journey south!” was the reply.“Including
the names of places where Redfern may be in hiding.”

“And so they’ll be apt to guard all those points?” asked Ben.As the reader will understand, one point, that at the ruined temple, had
been very well guarded indeed!“Yes,” replied the millionaire.“They are likely to look out for us at
all the places mentioned in the code despatches.”

Ben gave a low whistle of dismay, and directly the motors were pushing
the machine forward at the rate of fifty or more miles an hour.The aviators stopped on a level plateau about the middle of the
afternoon to prepare dinner, and then swept on again.At nightfall, they
were in the vicinity of a summit which lifted like a cone from a
circular shelf of rock which almost completely surrounded it.The millionaire aviator encircled the peak and finally decided that a
landing might be made with safety.He dropped the _Louise_ down very
slowly and was gratified to find that there would be little difficulty
in finding a resting-place below.As soon as he landed he turned his
eyes toward the _Bertha_, still circling above.The machine seemed to be coming steadily toward the shelf, but as he
looked the great planes wavered and tipped, and when the aeroplane
actually landed it was with a crash which threw Glenn from his seat and
brought about a great rattling of machinery.Glenn arose from the rock wiping blood from his face.“I’m afraid that’s the end of the _Bertha_!” he exclaimed.“I hope not,” replied Ben.“I think a lot of that old machine.”

Mr.Havens, after learning that Glenn’s injuries were not serious,
hastened over to the aeroplane and began a careful examination of the
motors.“I think,” he said in a serious tone, “that the threads on one of the
turn-buckles on one of the guy wires stripped so as to render the planes
unmanageable.”

“They were unmanageable, all right!” Glenn said, rubbing the sore spots
on his knees.“Can we fix it right here?” Ben asked.“That depends on whether we have a supply of turn-buckles,” replied
Havens.“They certainly ought to be in stock somewhere.”

“Glory be!” cried Glenn.“We sure have plenty of turn-buckles!”

“Get one out, then,” the millionaire directed, “and we’ll see what we
can do with it.”

The boys hunted everywhere in the tool boxes of both machines without
finding what they sought.“I know where they are!” said Glenn glumly in a moment.“Then get one out!” advised Ben.“They’re on the _Ann_!” explained Glenn.“If you remember we put the
spark plugs and a few other things of that sort on the _Louise_ and put
the turn-buckles on the _Ann_.”

“Now, you wait a minute,” Mr.“Perhaps I can use the old
turn-buckle on the sharp threads of the _Louise_ and put the one which
belongs there in the place of this worn one.Sometimes a transfer of
that kind can be made to work in emergencies.”

“That’ll be fine!” exclaimed Ben.I’ll hold the light while you take the buckle off the _Louise_.”

Ben turned his flashlight on the guy wires and the aviator began turning
the buckle.The wires were very taut, and when the last thread was
reached one of them sprang away so violently that the turn-buckle was
knocked from his hand.The next moment they heard it rattling in the
gorge below.Havens sat flat down on the shelf of rocks and looked at the parted
wires hopelessly.“Well,” the millionaire said presently, “I guess we’re in for a good
long cold night up in the sky.”

“Did you ever see such rotten luck?” demanded Glenn.“Cheer up!” cried Ben.“We’ll find some way out of it.”

“Have you got any fish-lines, boys?” asked the aviator.“You bet I have!” replied Ben.“You wouldn’t catch me off on a
flying-machine trip without a fish-line.We’re going to have some fish
before we get off the Andes.”

“Well,” said Mr.Havens, “pass it over and I’ll see if I can fasten
these wires together with strong cord and tighten them up with a
twister.”

“Why not?” asked Ben.“I’ve seen things of that kind done often enough!” declared Glenn.“And, besides,” Glenn added, “we may be able to use the worn turn-buckle
on the _Louise_ and go after repairs, leaving the _Bertha_ here.”

“I don’t like to do that!” objected the millionaire aviator.“I believe
we can arrange to take both machines out with us.”

But it was not such an easy matter fastening the cords and arranging the
twister as had been anticipated.They all worked over the problem for an
hour or more without finding any method of preventing the fish-line from
breaking when the twister was applied.When drawn so tight that it was
impossible to slip, the eyes showed a disposition to cut the strands.At last they decided that it would be unsafe to use the _Bertha_ in that
condition and turned to the _Louise_ with the worn turn-buckle.To their dismay they found that the threads were worn so that it would
be unsafe to trust themselves in the air with any temporary expedient
which might be used to strengthen the connection.“This brings us back to the old proposition of a night under the
clouds!” the millionaire said.“Or above the clouds,” Ben added, “if this fog keeps coming.”

Leaving the millionaire still studying over the needed repairs, Ben and
his chum followed the circular cliff for some distance until they came
to the east side of the cone.They stood looking over the landscape for
a moment and then turned back to the machines silently and with grave
faces.“Have you got plenty of ammunition, Mr.“I think so,” was the reply.“That’s good!” answered Ben.“Why the question?” Mr.Havens asked, with a surprised look.“Because,” Ben replied, “there’s a lot of Peruvian miners down on a
lower shelf of this cone and they’re drunk.”

“Well, they can’t get up here, can they?” asked Mr.“They’re making a stab at it!” answered Ben.“There seems to be a strike or something of that sort on down there,”
Glenn explained, “and it looks as if the fellows wanted to get up here
and take possession of the aeroplanes.”

“Perhaps we can talk them out of it!” smiled the millionaire.“I’m afraid we’ll have to do something more than talk,” Glenn answered.The three now went to the east side of the cone and looked down.There
was a gully leading from the shelf to a plateau below.At some past time
this gully had evidently been the bed of a running mountain stream.On
the plateau below were excavations and various pieces of crude mining
machinery.Between the excavations and the bottom of the gully at least a hundred
men were racing for the cut, which seemed to offer an easy mode of
access to the shelf where the flying machines lay.“We’ll have to stand here and keep them back!” Mr.“I don’t believe we can keep them back,” Glenn answered, “for there may
be other places similar to this.Those miners can almost climb a
vertical wall.”

The voices of the miners could now be distinctly heard, and at least
three or four of them were speaking in English.His words were greeted by a howl of derision.Havens said in a moment, “one of you would better go back
to the machines and see if there is danger from another point.”

Ben started away, but paused and took his friend by the arm.“What do you think of that?” he demanded, pointing away to the south.Havens grasped the boy’s hand and in the excitement of the moment
shook it vigorously.“I think,” he answered, “that those are the lights of the _Ann_, and
that we’ll soon have all the turn-buckles we want.”

The prophesy was soon verified.The _Ann_ landed with very little
difficulty, and the boys were soon out on the ledge.The miners drew back grumbling and soon disappeared in the excavations
below.As may well be imagined the greetings which passed between the two
parties were frank and heartfelt.The repair box of the _Ann_ was well
supplied with turn-buckles, and in a very short time the three machines
were on their way to the south.Havens and Sam sat together on the _Ann_, and during the long hours
after midnight while the machines purred softly through the chill air of
the mountains, the millionaire was informed of all that had taken place
at the ruined temple.“And that ruined temple you have described,” Mr.Havens said, with a
smile, “is in reality one of the underground stations on the way to the
Mystery of the Andes at Lake Titicaca.”

“And why?” asked Sam, “do they call any special point down there the
mystery of the Andes?There are plenty of mysteries in these tough old
mountain ranges!” he added with a smile.“But this is a particularly mysterious kind of a mystery,” replied Mr.“I’ll tell you all about it some other time.”




                             CHAPTER XXII.A great camp-fire blazed in one of the numerous valleys which nestle in
the Andes to the east of Lake Titicaca.The three flying machines, the
_Ann_, the _Louise_ and the _Bertha_, lay just outside the circle of
illumination.It was the evening of the fourth day after the incidents
recorded in the last chapter.The Flying Machine Boys had traveled at good speed, yet with frequent
rests, from the mountain cone above the Peruvian mines to the little
valley in which the machines now lay.Jimmie and Carl, well wrapped in blankets, were lying with their feet
extended toward the blaze, while Glenn was broiling venison steak at one
corner of the great fire, and, also, as he frequently explained,
broiling his face to a lobster finish while he turned the steaks about
in order to get the exact finish.The millionaire aviator and Sam sat some distance away discussing
prospects and plans for the next day.While they talked an Indian
accompanied by Ben came slowly out of the shadows at the eastern edge of
the valley and approached the fire.“Have you discovered the Mystery of the Andes?” asked Havens with a
laugh as the two came up.“We certainly have discovered the Mystery of the Andes!” cried Ben
excitedly.“But we haven’t discovered the mystery of the mystery!”

“Come again!” shouted Jimmie springing to his feet.“You see,” Ben went on, “Toluca took me to a point on the cliff to the
south from which the ghost lights of the mysterious fortress can be
seen, but we don’t know any more about the origin of the lights than we
did before we saw them.”

“Then there really are lights?” asked Carl.“There certainly are!” replied Ben.“What kind of an old shop, is it?” asked Jimmie.“It’s one of the old-time fortresses,” replied Ben.“It is built on a
steep mountainside and guards a pass between this valley and one beyond.It looks as if it might have been a rather formidable fortress a few
hundred years ago, but now a shot from a modern gun would send the
battlements flying into the valley.”

“But why the lights?” demanded Jimmie.“That’s the mystery!” Ben answered.“They’re ghost lights!”

“Up to within a few months,” Mr.Havens began, “this fortress has never
attracted much attention.It is said to be rather a large fortification,
and some of the apartments are said to extend under the cliff, in the
same manner as many of the gun rooms on Gibraltar extend into the
interior of that solid old rock.”

“More subterranean passages!” groaned Jimmie.“I never want to see or
hear of one again.Ever since that experience at the alleged temple they
will always smell of wild animals and powder smoke.”

“A few months ago,” the millionaire aviator continued, smiling
tolerantly at the boy, “ghostly lights began making their appearance in
the vicinity of the fort.American scientists who were in this part of
the country at that time made a careful investigation of the
demonstrations, and reported that the illuminations existed only in the
imaginations of the natives.And yet, it is certain that the scientists
were mistaken.”

“More bunk!” exclaimed Carl.Havens went on, “the natives kept religiously away from
the old fort, but now they seem to be willing to gather in its vicinity
and worship at the strange fires which glow from the ruined battlements.It is strange combination, and that’s a fact.”

“How long have these lights been showing?” asked Sam.“Perhaps six months,” was the reply.“I apprehend,” he said, “that you know exactly what that means.”

“I think I do!” was the reply.“Put us wise to it!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Perhaps,” smiled the millionaire, “I would better satisfy myself as to
the truth of my theory before I say anything more about it.”

“All right,” replied the boy with the air of a much-abused person, “then
I’ll go back to my blanket and sleep for the rest of my three weeks!”

“If you do,” Glenn cut in, “you’ll miss one of these venison steaks.”

Jimmie was back on his feet in a minute.“Lead me to it!” he cried.The boys still declare that that was the most satisfying meal of which
they ever partook.The broiled steaks were excellent, and the tinned
goods which had been purchased at one of the small Peruvian mining towns
on the way down, were fresh and sweet.As may be understood without extended description, the work of washing
the dishes and cleaning up after the meal was not long extended!In an hour every member of the party except Toluca was sound asleep.The
Indian had been engaged on the recommendation of an acquaintance at one
of the towns on the line of the interior railroad, and was entirely
trustworthy.He now sat just outside the circle of light, gazing with
rapt attention in the direction of the fortress which for some time past
had been known as the Mystery of the Andes.A couple of hours passed, and then Ben rolled over to where Jimmie lay
asleep, his feet toasting at the fire, his head almost entirely covered
by his blanket.“Wake up, sleepy-head!” Ben whispered.Jimmie stirred uneasily in his slumber and half opened his eyes.“Go on away!” he whispered.“But look here!” Ben insisted.“I’ve got something to tell you!”

Toluca arose and walked over to where the two boys were sitting.“Look here!” Ben went on.“Here’s Toluca now, and I’ll leave it to him
if every word I say isn’t true.He can’t talk much United States, but he
can nod when I make a hit.Can’t you, Toluca?”

The Indian nodded and Ben went on:

“Between this valley,” the boy explained, “and the face of the mountain
against which the fort sticks like a porous plaster is another valley.Through this second valley runs a ripping, roaring, foaming, mountain
stream which almost washes the face of the cliff against which the
fortress stands.This stream, you understand, is one of the original
defences, as it cuts off approach from the north.”

“I understand,” said Jimmie sleepily.“Now, the only way to reach this alleged mystery of the Andes from this
direction seems to be to sail over this valley in one of the machines
and drop down on the cliff at the rear.”

“But is there a safe landing there?” asked the boy.“Toluca says there is!”

“Has he been there?” asked Jimmie.“Of course he has!” answered Ben.“He doesn’t believe in the Inca
superstitions about ghostly lights and all that.”

“Then why don’t we take one of the machines and go over there?” demanded
Jimmie.“That would be fun!”

“That’s just what I came to talk with you about?”

“I’m game for it!” the boy asserted.“As a matter of fact,” Ben explained as the boys arose and softly
approached the _Louise_, “the only other known way of reaching the
fortress is by a long climb which occupies about two days.Of course,”
he went on, “the old fellows selected the most desirable position for
defence when they built the fort.That is,” he added, “unless we reach
it by the air route.”

“The air line,” giggled Jimmie, “is the line we’re patronizing
to-night.”

“Of course!” Ben answered.“All previous explorers, it seems, have
approached the place on foot, and by the winding ledges and paths
leading to it.Now, naturally, the people who are engineering the ghost
lights and all that sort of thing there see the fellows coming and get
the apparatus out of sight before the visitors arrive.”

“Does Mr.Havens know all about this?” asked Jimmie.“You’re dense, my son!” whispered Ben.“We’ve come all this way to light
down on the fortress in the night-time without giving warning of our
approach.That’s why we came here in the flying machines.”

“He thinks Redfern is here?” asked Jimmie.“He thinks this is a good place to look for him!” was the reply.“Then we’ll beat him to it!” Jimmie chuckled.Toluca seemed to understand what the boys were about to do and smiled
grimly as the machine lifted from the ground and whirled softly away.As
the _Louise_ left the valley, Mr.Havens and Sam turned lazily in their
blankets, doubtless disturbed by the sound of the motors, but, all being
quiet about the camp, soon composed themselves to slumber again.“Now, we’ll have to go slowly!” Ben exclaimed as the machine lifted so
that the lights of the distant mystery came into view, “for the reason
that we mustn’t make too much noise.Besides,” he went on, “we’ve got to
switch off to the east, cut a wide circle around the crags, and come
down on the old fort from the south.”

“And when we get there?” asked Jimmie.“Why,” replied Ben, “we’re going to land and sneak into the fort!That’s
what we’re going for!”

“I hope we won’t tumble into a lot of jaguars, and savages, and
half-breed Spaniards!” exclaimed Jimmie.“Oh, we’re just going to look now,” Ben answered, “and when we find out
what’s going on there we’re coming back and let Mr.We wouldn’t like to take all the glory away from him.”

Following this plan, the boys sent the machine softly away to the east,
flying without lights, and at as low altitude as possible, until they
were some distance away from the camp.In an hour the fortress showed to the north, or at least the summit
under which it lay did.“There’s the landing-place just east of that cliff,” Ben exclaimed, as
he swung still lower down.“I’ll see if I can hit it.”

The _Louise_ took kindly to the landing, and in ten minutes more the
boys were moving cautiously in the direction of the old fort, now lying
dark and silent under the starlight.It seemed to Jimmie that his heart
was in his throat as the possible solution of the mystery of the Andes
drew near!TWO RUNAWAY AVIATORS!Half an hour after the departure of the _Louise_, Sam awoke with a start
and moved over to where the millionaire aviator was sleeping.“Time to be moving!” he whispered in his ear.Havens yawned, stretched himself, and threw his blanket aside.“I don’t know,” he said with a smile, “but we’re doing wrong in taking
all the credit of this game.The boys have done good work ever since
leaving New York, and my conscience rather pricks me at the thought of
leaving them out of the closing act.”

“Well,” Sam answered, “the boys are certainly made of the right
material, if they are just a little too much inclined to take
unnecessary risks.I wouldn’t mind having them along, but, really,
there’s no knowing what one of them might do.”

“Very well,” replied Mr.Havens, “we’ll get underway in the _Ann_ and
land on top of the fortress before the occupants of that musty old
fortification know that we are in the air.”

“That’s the talk!” Sam agreed.“We’ll make a wide circuit to the west
and come up on that side of the summit which rises above the fort.I’m
certain, from what I saw this afternoon, that there is a good
landing-place there.Most of these Peruvian mountain chains,” he went
on, “are plentifully supplied with good landings, as the shelves and
ledges which lie like terraces on the crags were formerly used as
highways and trails by the people who lived here hundreds of years ago.”

“We must be very careful in getting away from the camp,” Mr.“We don’t want the boys to suspect that we are going off on a
little adventure of our own.”

“Very well,” replied the other, “I’ll creep over in the shadows and push
the _Ann_ down the valley so softly that they’ll never know what’s taken
place.If you walk down a couple of hundred yards, I’ll pick you up.Then we’ll be away without disturbing any one.”

So eager were the two to leave the camp without their intentions being
discovered by the others, that they did not stop to see whether all the
three machines were still in place.The _Ann_ stood farthest to the
east, next to the _Bertha_, and Sam crept in between the two aeroplanes
and began working the _Ann_ slowly along the grassy sward.Had he lifted his head for a moment and looked to the rear, he must have
seen that only the _Bertha_ lay behind him.Had he investigated the two
rolls of blankets lying near the fire, he would have seen that they
covered no sleeping forms!The _Ann_ moved noiselessly
down the valley to where Mr.Havens awaited her and was sent into the
air.The rattle of the motors seemed to the two men to be loud enough to
bring any one within ten miles out of a sound sleep, but they saw no
movements below, and soon passed out of sight.Wheeling sharply off to the west, they circled cliffs, gorges and grassy
valleys for an hour until they came to the western <DW72> of the mountain
which held the fortress.It will be remembered that the _Louise_ had
circled to the east.Havens said as he slowed down, “if we find a
landing-place here, even moderately secure, down we go.If I don’t, I’ll
shoot up again and land squarely on top of the fort.”

“I don’t believe it’s got any roof to land on!” smiled Sam.“Yes, it has!” replied Mr.“I’ve had the old fraud investigated.I know quite a lot about her!”

“You have had her investigated?” asked Sam, in amazement.“You know very well,” the millionaire went on, “that we have long
suspected Redfern to be hiding in this part of Peru.I can’t tell you
now how we secured all the information we possess on the subject.“However, it is enough to say that by watching the mails and sending out
messengers we have connected the rival trust company of which you have
heard me speak with mysterious correspondents in Peru.The work has been
long, but rather satisfying.”

“Why,” Sam declared, “I thought this expedition was a good deal of a
guess!I hadn’t any idea you knew so much about this country.”

“We know more about it than is generally believed,” was the answer.“Deposit box A, which was robbed on the night Ralph Hubbard was
murdered, contained, as I have said, all the information we possessed
regarding this case.When the papers were stolen I felt like giving up
the quest, but the code telegrams cheered me up a bit, especially when
they were stolen.”

“I don’t see anything cheerful in having the despatches stolen.”

“It placed the information I possessed in the hands of my enemies, of
course,” the other went on, “but at the same time it set them to
watching the points we had in a way investigated, and which they now
understood that we intended to visit.”

“I don’t quite get you!” Sam said.“You had an illustration of that at the haunted temple,” Mr.“The Redfern group knew that that place was on my list.By
some quick movement, understood at this time only by themselves, they
sent a man there to corrupt the custodian of the captive animals.Only for courage and good sense, the machines
would have been destroyed.”

“The savages unwittingly helped some!” suggested Sam.“Yes, everything seemed to work to your advantage,” Mr.“At the mines, now,” he continued, “we helped ourselves out
of the trap set for us.”

“You don’t think the miners, too, were working under instructions?”
asked Sam.“That seems impossible!”

“This rival trust company,” Mr.Havens went on, “has agents in every
part of the world.It is my
belief that not only the men of the mine we came upon, but the men of
every other mine along the Andes, were under instructions to look out
for, and, under some pretense, destroy any flying machines which made
their appearance.”

“They are nervy fighters, anyway, if this is true!” Sam said.“They certainly are, and for the very good reason that the arrest and
conviction of Redfern would place stripes on half a dozen of the
directors of the new company.As you have heard me say before, the proof
is almost positive that the money embezzled from us was placed in this
new company.Redfern is a sneak, and will confess everything to protect
himself.Hence, the interest of the trust company in keeping him out of
sight.”

“Well, I hope he won’t get out of sight after to-night,” suggested Sam.“I hope we’ll have him good and tight before morning.”

“I firmly believe that he will be taken to-night!” was the reply.The machine was now only a short distance above the ledge upon which the
aviator aimed to land.Even in the dim light they could see a level
stretch of rock, and the _Ann_ was soon resting easily within a short
distance of the fort, now hidden only by an angle of the cliff.Presently the two moved forward together and looked around the base of
the cliff.The fort lay dark and silent in the night.So far as
appearances were concerned, there had never been any lights displayed
from her battlements during the long years which had passed away since
her construction!There was only a very narrow ledge between the northern wall of the fort
and the precipice which struck straight down into the valley, three
hundred feet below.In order to reach the interior of the fortification
from the position they occupied, it would be necessary for Havens and
his companion to pass along this ledge and creep into an opening which
faced the valley.At regular intervals on the outer edge of this ledge were balanced great
boulders, placed there in prehistoric times for use in case an attempt
should be made to scale the precipice.A single one of these rocks, if
cast down at the right moment, might have annihilated an army.The two men passed along the ledge gingerly, for they understood that a
slight push would send one of these boulders crashing down.At last they
came to what seemed to be an entrance into the heart of the fortress.There were no lights in sight as they looked in.The place seemed
utterly void of human life.Sam crept in first and waited for his companion to follow.Havens
sprang at the ledge of the opening, which was some feet above the level
of the shelf on which he stood, and lifted himself by his arms.As he
did so a fragment of rock under one hand gave way and he dropped back.In saving himself he threw out both feet and reached for a crevice in
the wall.This would have been an entirely safe procedure if his feet
had not come with full force against one of the boulders overlooking the
valley.He felt the stone move under the pressure, and the next instant, with a
noise like the discharge of a battery of artillery, the great boulder
crashed down the almost perpendicular face of the precipice and was
shattered into a thousand fragments on a rock which lay at the verge of
the stream below.With a soft cry of alarm, Sam bent over the ledge which protected the
opening and seized his employer by the collar.It was quick and
desperate work then, for it was certain that every person within a
circuit of many miles had heard the fall of the boulder.Doubtless in less than a minute the occupants of the fortress—if such
there were—would be on their feet ready to contest the entrance of the
midnight visitors.“We’ve got to get into some quiet nook mighty quick,” Sam whispered in
Mr.Havens’ ear as the latter was drawn through the opening.“I guess
the ringing of that old door-bell will bring the ghost out in a hurry!”

The two crouched in an angle of the wall at the front interior of the
place and listened.Directly a light flashed out at the rear of what
seemed to the watchers to be an apartment a hundred yards in length.Then footsteps came down the stone floor and a powerful arc light filled
every crevice and angle of the great apartment with its white rays.There was no need to attempt further concealment.The two sprang
forward, reaching for their automatics, as three men with weapons
pointing towards them advanced under the light.“I guess,” Sam whispered, “that this means a show-down.”

“There’s no getting out of that!” whispered Havens.“We have reached the
end of the journey, for the man in the middle is Redfern!”




                             CHAPTER XXIV.As Redfern and his two companions advanced down the apartment, their
revolvers leveled, Havens and Sam dropped their hands away from their
automatics.“Hardly quick enough, Havens,” Redfern said, advancing with a wicked
smile on his face.“To tell you the truth, old fellow, we have been
looking for you for a couple of days!”

“I’ve been looking for you longer than that!” replied Mr.“Well,” Redfern said with a leer, “it seems that we have both met our
heart’s desire.How are your friends?”

“Sound asleep and perfectly happy,” replied the millionaire.“You mean that they were asleep when you left them.”

“Certainly!”

“Fearful that they might oversleep themselves,” Redfern went on, “I sent
my friends to awake them.I expect
to hold quite a reception to-night.”

Laying his automatic down on the floor, Havens walked deliberately to a
great easy-chair which stood not far away and sat down.No one would
judge from the manner of the man that he was not resting himself in one
of his own cosy rooms at his New York hotel.Sam was not slow in
following the example of his employer.Redfern frowned slightly at the
nonchalance of the man.“You make yourself at home!” he said.“I have a notion,” replied Mr.Havens, “that I paid for most of this
furniture.I think I have a right to use it.”

“Look here, Havens,” Redfern said, “you have no possible show of getting
out of this place alive unless you come to terms with me.”

“From the lips of any other man in the world I might believe the
statement,” Mr.“But you, Redfern, have proven yourself
to be such a consummate liar that I don’t believe a word you say.”

“Then you’re not open to compromise?”

Havens shook his head.There was now a sound of voices in what seemed to be a corridor back of
the great apartment, and in a moment Glenn and Carl were pushed into the
room, their wrists bound tightly together, their eyes blinking under the
strong electric light.Both boys were almost sobbing with rage and
shame.“They jumped on us while we were asleep!” cried Carl.Redfern went to the back of the room and looked out into the passage.“Where are the others?” he asked of some one who was not in sight.“These boys were the only ones remaining in camp,” was the reply.“Redfern,” said Havens, as coolly as if he had been sitting at his own
desk in the office of the Invincible Trust Company, “will you tell me
how you managed to get these boys here so quickly?”

“Not the slightest objection in the world,” was the reply.“There is a
secret stairway up the cliff.You took a long way to get here in that
clumsy old machine.”

“Thank you!” said Mr.“Now, if you don’t mind,” Redfern said, “we’ll introduce you to your new
quarters.They are not as luxurious as those you occupy in New York, but
I imagine they will serve your purpose until you are ready to come to
terms.”

He pointed toward the two prisoners, and the men by his side advanced
with cords in their hands.Havens extended his wrists with a smile on
his face and Sam did likewise.“You’re good sports,” cried Redfern.“It’s a pity we can’t come to
terms!”

“Never mind that!” replied Havens.“Go on with your program.”

Redfern walked back to the corridor and the prisoners heard him
dismissing some one for the night.“You may go to bed now,” he said.The two
men with me will care for the prisoners.”

The party passed down a stone corridor to the door of a room which had
evidently been used as a fortress dungeon in times past.Redfern turned
a great key in the lock and motioned the prisoners inside.At that moment he stood facing the prisoners with the two others at his
sides, all looking inquiringly into the faces of those who were taking
their defeat so easily.As Redfern swung his hand toward the open door he felt something cold
pressing against his neck.He turned about to face an automatic revolver
held in the hands of Ben Whitcomb!His two accomplices moved forward a
pace in defense, but drew back when they saw the automatic in Jimmie’s
hand within a foot of their breasts.“And now,” said Mr.Havens, as coolly as if the situation was being put
on in a New York parlor, “you three men will please step inside.”

“I’m a game loser, too!” exclaimed Redfern.In a moment the door was closed and locked and the cords were cut from
the hands of the four prisoners.“Good!” said Jimmie.“I don’t know what you fellows would do without me.I’m always getting you out of scrapes!”

What was said after that need not be repeated here.Havens thoroughly appreciated the service which had been
rendered.“The game is played to the end, boys,” he said in a moment.“The only
thing that remains to be done is to get Redfern down the secret stairway
to the machines.The others we care nothing about.”

“I know where that secret stairway is,” Ben said.“While we were
sneaking around here in the darkness, a fellow came climbing up the
stairs, grunting as though he had reached the top of the Washington
monument.”

“Where were the others put to bed?” asked Sam.“We heard Redfern dismiss
them for the night.Did you see where they went?”

“Sure!” replied Jimmie.“They’re in a room opening from this corridor a
little farther down.”

Mr.Havens took the key from the lock of the door before him and handed
it to Jimmie.“See if you can lock them in with this,” he said.The boy returned in a moment with a grin on his face.“They are locked in!” he said.“Are there any others here?” asked Havens.“They all go away at night,” he declared, “after they turn out the ghost
lights.Redfern it seems keeps only those two with him for company.Their friends will unlock them in the morning.”

Mr.Havens opened the door and called out to Redfern, who immediately
appeared in the opening.“Search his pockets and tie his hands,” the millionaire said, turning to
Sam.“You know what this means, Redfern?” he added to the prisoner.“It means Sing Sing,” was the sullen reply, “but there are plenty of
others who will keep me company.”

“That’s the idea!” cried Havens.“That’s just why I came here!I want
the officials of the new trust company more than I want you.”

“You’ll get them if I have my way about it!” was the reply.An hour later the _Ann_ and the _Louise_ dropped down in the green
valley by the camp-fire.Redfern was sullen at first, but before the
start which was made soon after sunrise he related to Havens the
complete story of his embezzlement and his accomplices.He told of the
schemes which had been resorted to by the officials of the new trust
company to keep him out of the United States, and to keep Havens from
reaching him.The Flying Machine Boys parted with Havens at Quito, the millionaire
aviator going straight to Panama with his prisoner, while the boys
camped and hunted and fished in the Andes for two weeks before returning
to New York.It had been the intention of the lads to bring Doran and some of the
others at Quito to punishment, but it was finally decided that the
victory had been so complete that they could afford to forgive their
minor enemies.They had been only pawns in the hands of a great
corporation.“The one fake thing about this whole proposition,” Jimmie said as the
boys landed in New York, sunburned and happy, “is that alleged Mystery
of the Andes!It was too commonplace—just a dynamo in a subterranean
mountain stream, and electric lights!Say,” he added, with one of his
inimitable grins, “electricity makes pretty good ghost lights, though!”

“Redfern revealed his residence by trying to conceal it!” declared Ben.Still,” he went on, “the Mystery was some
mystery for a long time!It must have cost a lot to set the stage for
it.”

The next day Mr.Havens called to visit the boys at their hotel.“While you were loafing in the mountains,” he said, after greetings had
been exchanged, “the murderer of Hubbard confessed and was sentenced to
die in the electric chair.Redfern and half a dozen directors of the new
trust company have been given long sentences at Sing Sing.”

“There are associates that ought to go, too!” Jimmie cried.“We’re not going to prosecute them,” Mr.“But this is
not to the point.The Federal Government wants you boys to undertake a
little mission for the Secret Service men.You see,” he went on, “you
boys made quite a hit in that Peruvian job.”

“Will Sam go?” asked Ben.“Sam is Sam no longer,” replied Mr.“He is now
Warren P. King, son of the banker!What do you think of that?”

“Then what was he doing playing the tramp?” asked Carl.“Oh, he quarreled with his father, and it was the old story, but it is
all smooth sailing for him now.He may go with you, but his father
naturally wants him at home for a spell.”

“Where are we to go?” asked Ben.“I’ll tell you that later,” was the reply.“Will you go?”

The boys danced around the room and declared that they were ready to
start that moment.The story of their adventures on the trip will be
found in the next volume of this series, entitled:

“The Flying Machine Boys on Secret Service; or, the Capture in the Air!”


                                THE END.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                            Transcriber’s Notes:

    Italicized phrases are presented by surrounding the text with
    _underscores_.Minor spelling, punctuation and typographic errors were corrected
    silently, except as noted below.Hyphenated words have been retained
    as they appear in the original text.On page 3, "smoldered" was left as is (rather than changed to
    "smouldered"), as both spellings were used in the time period.On page 99, "say" was added to "I don't care what you about Sam".On page 197, "good-by" was changed to "good-bye" to be consistent
    with other usage in the book.And so he wrapped himself in the blanket which
Dona Maria brought from within the church, and lay down beside the
faithful pair.In the long hours of that lonely night Jose lay beneath the shimmering
stars pondering, wondering.Down below in the smitten town the poor
children of his flock were eating their hearts out in anxious dread
and bitter sorrow.Was it through any fault of theirs that this thing
had come upon them, like a bolt from a cloudless sky?No--except that
they were human, mortal.And if the thing were real, it came from the
mind that is God; if unreal--but it seemed real to these simple folk,
terribly so!His heart yearned toward them as his thought penetrated the still
reaches of the night and hovered about their lonely vigil.What balm could he extend to those wearing out weary
hours on beds of agony below?True religion, if they could
but understand it; but not again the empty husks of the faith that had
been taught them in the name of Christ!Where did scholastic theology
stand in such an hour as this?Did it offer easement from their
torture of mind and body?Strength to bear in patience their heavy
burden?Not of this life--nay, naught but the thread-worn,
undemonstrable promise of a life to come, if, indeed, they might
happily avoid the pangs of purgatory and the horrors of the quenchless
flames of hell!God, what had not the Church to answer for!And yet, these ignorant children were but succumbing to the
evidence of their material senses--though small good it would do to
tell them so!Could they but know--as did Carmen--that rejection of
error and reception of truth meant life--ah, could they but know!Could he himself but know--really _know_--that God is neither the
producer of evil, nor the powerless witness of its ravages--could
he but understand and prove that evil is not a self-existing
entity, warring eternally with God, what might he not accomplish!For Jesus had said: "These signs"--the cure of disease, the rout of
death--"shall follow them that believe," that understand, that
know.Why could he not go down to those beds of torture and say
with the Christ: "Arise, for God hath made thee whole"?He knew
why--"without faith it is impossible to please Him: for he that
cometh of God must believe"--must _know_--"that He is a rewarder of
them that diligently seek Him."The suffering victims in the town
below were asleep in a state of religious dullness.The task of
independent thinking was onerous to such as they.Gladly did they
leave it to the Church to do their thinking for them.And thus did
they suffer for the trust betrayed!But truth is omnipotent, and "one with God is a majority."Jesus gave
few rules, but none more fundamental than that "with God all things
are possible."If so, he might arise
and go down into the stricken town and bid its frightened children be
whole.If he fully recognized "the Father" as all-powerful,
all-good, and if he could clearly see and retain his grasp on the
truth that evil, the supposititious opposite of good, had neither
place nor power, except in the minds of mortals receptive to it--ah,
then--then----

A soft patter of little feet on the shales broke in upon his thought.He turned and beheld Carmen coming through the night."Padre dear," she whispered, "why didn't you come and sleep in the
church with me?"He had not the heart nor the
courage to send her away.He put out his arm and drew her to him."Padre dear," the child murmured, "it is nice out here under the
stars--and I want to be with you--I love you--love you--" The whisper
died away, and the child slept on his arm.CHAPTER 20


Dawn brought Juan Mendoza and Pedro Cardenas again to the hill, and
with them came others."Mateo Gil, Pablo Polo, and Juanita Gomez are
sick, Padre," announced Mendoza, the spokesman."They ask for the last
sacrament.You could come down and give it to them, and then return to
the hill, is it not so?""Yes," assented Jose, "I will come.""And, Padre," continued Mendoza, "we talked it over last night, after
Amado Sanchez died, and we think it would help if you said a Mass for
us in the church to-day.""I will do so this afternoon, after I have visited the sick," he
replied pityingly.Then--

"We think, too, Padre, that if we held a procession--in honor of Santa
Barbara--perhaps she would pray for us, and might stop the sickness.We could march through the town this evening, while you stood here and
prayed as we passed around the hill.But the anxious faces
directed toward him melted his heart."Yes, children," he replied gently, "do as you wish.Keep your houses
this afternoon while I visit the sick and offer the Mass.I will leave
the _hostia_ on the altar.Carry it
with you in your rogation to Santa Barbara this evening, and I will
stand here and pray for you."The people departed, sorrowing, but grateful.Hope revived in the
breasts of some.But most of them awaited in trembling the icy touch
of the plague."Padre," said Rosendo, when the people had gone."I have been thinking
about the sickness, and I remember what my father told me he learned
from a Jesuit missionary.It was that the fat from a human body would
cure rheumatism.And then the missionary laughed and said that the fat
from a plump woman would cure all diseases of mind and body.If that
is so, Padre, and Juanita Gomez dies--she is very plump, Padre--could
we not take some of the fat from her body and rub it on the sick--"

"God above, Rosendo!cried Jose recoiling in
horror."Would you not try everything
that might possibly save these people?"No, my faithful ally," replied Jose."You did not get the sense in
which he said it.Neither human fat nor medicine of any kind will help
these people.Nothing will be accomplished for them until their fear
has been removed.For, I--well, the symptoms manifested by poor Feliz
may have been those of Asiatic cholera.Daniel travelled to the garden.And as
for Sanchez--_Bien_, we do not know--not for certain."He stopped and
pondered the question."Padre," pursued Rosendo, "I have used the liver of a lizard for
toothache, and it was very good.""I have no doubt of it, Rosendo," replied Jose, with a smile."And in
days past stranger remedies than that were used by supposedly wise
people.When the eyesight was poor, they rubbed wax from the human ear
upon the eyes, and I doubt not marvelous restorations of sight were
made.So also dogs' teeth were ground into powder and taken to
alleviate certain bodily pains.Almost everything that could be
swallowed has been taken by mankind to cure their aches and torments.But they still ache to-day; and will continue to do so, I believe,
until their present state of mind greatly changes."When the simple midday meal of corn _arepa_ and black coffee was
finished, Jose descended into the quiet town."It is absurd that we
should be kept on the hill," he had said to Rosendo, "but these dull,
simple minds believe that, having handled those dead of the plague, we
have become agents of infection.They forget that they themselves are
living either in the same house with it, or closely adjacent.But it
humors them, poor children, and we will stay here for their sakes.""_Caramba!_ and they have made us their sextons!"The clammy hand of fear again reached for his heart.He turned to Carmen, who was busily occupied in the shade of the old
church."Your lessons, _chiquita_?"he queried, going to her for a moment's
abstraction."No, Padre dear," she replied, smiling up at him, while she quickly
concealed the bit of paper on which she had been writing."Then what are you doing, little one?""Padre dear--don't--don't always make me tell you everything," she
pleaded, but only half in earnest, as she cast an enigmatical glance
at him."But this time I insist on knowing; so you might as well tell me.""Well then, if you must know," she replied, her face beaming with a
happiness which seemed to Jose strangely out of place in that tense
atmosphere, "I have been writing a question to God."I have done that for a long, long time.When I
want to know what to do, and think I don't see just what is best, I
write my question to God on a piece of paper.Then I read it to Him,
and tell Him I know He knows the answer and that He will tell me.And
then I put the paper under a stone some place, and--well, that's all,
Padre.She beamed at him like a glorious noonday
sun.The priest stood before her in wonder and admiration."And does He
tell you the answers to your questions, _chiquita_?"Not always right away--but He never fails--never!""Will you tell me what you are asking Him now?"His eyes dimmed as he read:

  "Dear, dear Father, please tell your little girl and her dear
  Padre Jose what it is that makes the people think they have to die
  down in the town.""And where will you put the paper, little girl?"he asked, striving to
control his voice."Why, I don't know, Padre.Oh, why not put it under the altar in this
old church?"she exclaimed, pleased with the thought of such a novel
hiding place.assented Jose; and together they entered the building.After much stumbling over rubbish, much soiling of hands and
disturbing of bats and lizards, while Carmen's happy laugh rang
merrily through the gloomy old pile, they laid the paper carefully
away behind the altar in a little pocket, and covered it with an adobe
brick."Now we will wait for the
answer."Jose went down into the ominous silence of the town with a lighter
heart.The sublime faith of the child moved before him like a beacon.To the sick he spoke words of comfort, with the vision of Carmen
always before him.At the altar in the empty church, where he offered
the Mass in fulfillment of his promise to the people, her fair form
glowed with heavenly radiance from the pedestal where before had stood
the dilapidated image of the Virgin.He prepared the sacred wafer and
left a part of it on the altar for the people to carry in their
procession to Santa Barbara.The other portion he took to the sick
ones who had asked for the sacrament.Mateo Gil, he thought, could
not live the night through.He knelt at the loathsome bedside of the
suffering man and prayed long and earnestly for light.He tried not to
ask, but to know.While there, he heard a call from the street,
announcing the passing of Guillermo Hernandez.The plague was upon them in all its cruel virulence.Sadly he returned to the hill, just as the sun tipped the highest
peaks of the _Cordilleras_.Standing on the crest, he waited with
heavy heart, while the mournful little procession wended its sad way
through the streets below.An old, battered wooden image of one of the
Saints, rescued from the oblivion of the _sacristia_, had been dressed
to represent Santa Barbara.This, bedecked with bits of bright 
ribbon, was carried at the head of the procession by the faithful
Juan.Following him, Pedro Gonzales, old and tottering, bore a dinner
plate, on which rested the _hostia_, while over the wafer a tall young
lad held a soiled umbrella, for there was no canopy.A slow chant rose from the lips of the people like a dirge.It struck
the heart of the priest like a chill wind."_ Tears streamed from his eyes while he gazed upon his stricken
people.Slowly, wearily, they wound around the base of the hill, some
sullen with despair, others with eyes turned beseechingly upward to
where the priest of God stood with outstretched hands, his full heart
pouring forth a passionate appeal to Him to turn His light upon these
simple-minded children.When they had gone back down the road, their
bare feet raising a cloud of thick dust which hid them from his view,
Jose sank down upon the rock and buried his face in his hands."I know--I think I know, oh, God," he murmured; "but as yet I have not
proved--not yet.But grant that I may soon--for their sakes.""There is another body to bury to-night,
Padre.*       *       *       *       *

Standing over the new grave, in the solemn hush of night, the priest
murmured: "I am the resurrection and the life."But the mound upon
which Rosendo was stolidly heaping the loose earth marked only another
victory of the mortal law of death over a human sense of life.And
there was no one there to call forth the sleeping man."Behold, I give you power over all things," said the marvelous Jesus.The wondrous, irresistible power which he exerted in behalf of
suffering humanity, he left with the world when he went away."Still here," sighed the sorrowing priest, "still here--lo, always
here--but we know it not.Sunken in materiality, and enslaved to the
false testimony of the physical senses, we lack the spirituality that
alone would enable us to grasp and use that Christ-power, which is the
resurrection and the life.""Padre," said Rosendo, when they turned back toward the hill,
"Hernandez is now with the angels.You gave him the sacrament, did you
not?""_Bien_, then you remitted his sins, and he is doubtless in paradise.But," he mused, "it may be that he had first to pass through
purgatory._Caramba!_ I like not the thought of those hot fires!""Your mental wanderings at
times are puerile!Do not be
deceived, Hernandez is still the same man, even though he has left his
earthly body behind.Do not think he has been lifted at once into
eternal bliss.The Church has taught such rubbish for ages, and has
based its pernicious teachings upon the grossly misunderstood words of
Jesus.The Church is a failure--a dead, dead failure, in every sense
of the word!And that man lying there in his grave is a ghastly proof
of it!"Rosendo looked wonderingly at the excited priest, whose bitter words
rang out so harshly on the still night air."The Church has failed utterly to preserve the simple gospel of the
Christ!It has basely, wantonly betrayed its traditional trust!It has
fought and slain and burned for centuries over trivial, vulnerable
non-essentials, and thrown its greatest pearls to the swine!It no
longer prophesies; it carps and reviles!It no longer heals the sick;
but it conducts a purgatorial lottery at so much a head!It has become
a jumble of idle words, a mumbling of silly formulae, a category of
stupid, insensate ceremonies!Its children are taught to derive their
faith from such legends as that of the holy Saint Francis, who, to
convince a heretic, showed the _hostia_ to an ass, which on beholding
the sacred dough immediately kneeled!"_Ca-ram-ba!_ But you speak hard words, Padre!"muttered Rosendo,
vague speculations flitting through his brain as to the priest's
mental state.continued Jose heatedly, "the Church has fought truth
desperately ever since the Master's day!It has fawned at the feet of
emperor and plutocrat, and licked the bloody hand of the usurer who
tossed her a pittance of his foul gains!In the great world-battles
for reform, for the rights of man, for freedom from the slavery of man
to man or to drink and drugs, she has come up only as the smoke has
cleared away, but always in time to demand the spoils!She has filched
from the systems of philosophy of every land and age, and after
bedaubing them with her own gaudy colors, has foisted them upon
unthinking mankind as divine decrees and mandates!She has foully
insulted God and man!--"

"_Caramba_, Padre!_Hombre_, we must get back to the
hill!You voice the Church's stock complaint of every
man who exposes her shams: 'He hath a devil!'"Jose went on more excitedly:

"You ask if Hernandez is in paradise or purgatory.He is in a state no
better nor worse than our own, for both are wholly mental.We are now
in the fires of as great a purgatory as any man can ever experience!Yes, there is a purgatory--right here on earth--and it follows us
after death, and after every death that we shall die, until we learn
to know God and see Him as infinite good, without taint or trace of
evil!The flames of hell are eternal to us as long as we eat of 'the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil'--as long as we believe in
other powers than God--as long as we believe sin and disease and evil
to be as real and as potent as good!When we know these things as
awful human illusions, and when we recognize God as the infinite mind
that did not create evil, and does not know or behold it, then, and
then only, will the flames of purgatory and hell in this state of
consciousness which we mistakenly call life, and in the states of
consciousness still to come, begin to diminish in intensity, and
finally die out!"Then he turned to Rosendo
and put his hand affectionately upon the old man's shoulder."My good
friend," he said more calmly, "I speak with intense feeling, for I
have suffered much through the intolerance, the unspirituality, and
the worldly ambition of the agents of Holy Church.I suffer, because I
see what she is, and how widely she has missed the mark.But, worse, I
see how blindly, how cruelly, she leads and betrays her trusting
children--and it is the thought of that which at times almost drives
me mad!Do you but look to Carmen for your faith.She knows God, and she will lead you straight to Him.And
as you follow her, your foolish ideas of purgatory, hell, and
paradise, of wafers and virgins--all the tawdry beliefs which the
Church has laid upon you, will drop off, one by one, and melt away as
do the mists on the lake when the sun mounts high."Carmen and Dona Maria sat against the wall of the old church, waiting
for them.The child ran through the darkness and grasped Jose's hand."I wouldn't go to sleep until you came, Padre!""I
wanted to be sure you wouldn't sleep anywhere else than right next to
me.""Padre," admonished Rosendo anxiously, "do you think you ought to let
her come close to you now?The plague--"

Jose turned to him and spoke low."There is no power or influence that
we can exert upon her, Rosendo, either for good or evil.She is
obeying a spiritual law of which we know but little.""Just this, Rosendo: _'Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind
is stayed on thee.'_"

The late moon peeped timidly above the drowsing treetops.Its yellow
beams stole silently across the still lake and up the hillside to the
crumbling church.When they reached the four quiet figures, huddled
close against the ghostly wall, they filtered like streams of liquid
gold through the brown curls of the little head lying on the priest's
shoulder.And there they dwelt as symbols of Love's protecting care
over the trusting children of this world, until the full dawn of the
glorious sun of Truth.CHAPTER 21


Jose rose from his hard bed stiff and weary.Depression sat heavily
upon his soul, and he felt miserably unable to meet the day.Dona
Maria was preparing the coffee over a little fire back of the church.The odor of the steaming liquid drifted to him on the warm morning air
and gave him a feeling of nausea.Was the plague's cold hand settling upon him?Giddiness seized him, and he sat down again upon the rocks.In the road below a cloud of dust was rising, and across the distance
a murmur of voices floated up to his ears.He
wondered dully what additional trouble it portended.Rosendo came to
him at that moment."_Muy buenos dias, Padre._ I saw a boat come across the lake some
minutes ago.Jose struggled to his feet and
went forth to meet them."_Hola, Senor Padre Jose!_ _Dios mio_, but your hill is steep!"The man quickly gained the
summit, and hurried to grasp the bewildered priest's hand.don't you know me, _Senor Padre_?"he cried,
slapping Jose roundly upon the back.The light of recognition slowly came into the priest's eyes.The man
was Don Jorge, his erstwhile traveling companion on the Magdalena
river."And now a cup of that coffee, if you will do me the favor, my good
_Cura_.And then tell me what ails you here," he added, seating
himself."_Caramba_, what a town!Diego was right--the devil himself
made this place!But they say you have all taken to dying!_Caramba_, I do not wonder!Such a God-forsaken
spot!_Caramba!_ so they told me down below, and I would not
believe them!"One of our men brought it from Bodega Central."There isn't a trace of
cholera in the place, as far as I know!You have all gone crazy--but
small wonder!"His ears
were reporting things basely false."You say--" he began in
bewilderment."I say what I have said, _amigo_!There is no more cholera in Bodega
Central than there is in heaven!I arrived there day before yesterday,
and left before sunrise this morning.Jose sank weakly down at the man's side."But--Don Jorge--Feliz Gomez
returned from there three nights ago, and reported that a Turk, who
had come up from the coast, had died of the plague!"Don Jorge's brows knit in perplexity."I recall now," he said slowly,
after some moments of study."The innkeeper did say that a Turk had
died there--some sort of intestinal trouble, I believe.When I told
him I was bound for Simiti, he laughed as if he would split, and then
began to talk about the great fright he had given a man from here.Said he scared the fellow until his black face turned white.But I was
occupied with my own affairs, and paid him little attention.But come,
tell me all about it."With the truth slowly dawning upon his clouded thought, Jose related
the grewsome experiences of the past three days.But, was Feliz Gomez sick before he went to Bodega Central?""Yes, senor," interposed Rosendo."He and Amado Sanchez both had bowel
trouble.Their women told my wife so, after you and I, Padre, had come
up here to the hill.We have it here often, as you
know.""True," assented Jose, "but we have never given it any serious
thought."Don Jorge leaned back and broke into a roar of laughter."_Por el amor
del cielo!_ You are all crazy, _amigo_--you die like rats of fear!Did
you ever put a mouse into a bottle and then scare it to death with a
loud noise?_Hombre!_ That is what has happened to you!"The hill
reverberated with his loud shouts.But Jose could not share in the merriment.The awful consequences of
the innkeeper's coarse joke upon the childish minds of these poor,
impressionable people pressed heavily upon his heart.Bitter tears
welled to his eyes."We must go down and tell these people the
truth!"Don Jorge joined them, and they all hastened down into the town.Ramona Chaves met them in the _plaza_, her eyes streaming."Padre," she wailed, "my man Pedro has the sickness!loudly cried Jose; "there is no cholera
here!"He hastened to the bedside of the writhing Pedro.There
is no cholera in Simiti!He and Amado had only a touch of the flux, and they died
of fear!"The priest's ringing words acted upon the man like magic.He roused up
from his lethargy and stared at the assemblage.Don Jorge repeated the
priest's words, and added his own laughing and boisterous comments.Pedro rose from his bed, and stood staring.Together, their little band augmented at every corner by the startled
people, they hurried to the homes of all who lay upon beds of
sickness, spreading the glad tidings, until the little town was in a
state of uproar.Like black shadows before the light, the plague fled
into the realm of imagination from which it had come.By night, all
but Mateo Gil were up and about their usual affairs.But even Mateo
had revived wonderfully; and Jose was confident that the good news
would be the leaven of health that would work a complete restoration
within him in time.The exiles left the hilltop and the old church,
and returned again to their homes.Don Jorge took up his abode with
Jose."_Bien_," he said, as they sat at the rear door of the priest's house,
looking through the late afternoon haze out over the lake, "you have
had a strange experience--_Caramba_!most strange!--and yet one from
which you should gather an excellent lesson.You are dealing with
children here--children who have always been rocked in the cradle of
the Church.But--" looking archly at Jose, "do I offend?For, as I
told you on the boat a year ago, I do not think you are a good
priest.""_Bien_," he added, "I will correct that.You are good--but not a priest, is it not so?""I have some views, Don Jorge, which differ radically from those of
the faith," Jose said cautiously."_Caramba!_ I should hope so!""But," interposed Jose, anxious to direct the conversation into other
channels, "may I ask how and where you have occupied yourself since I
left the boat at Badillo?"said Don Jorge, shaking his head, although his eyes
twinkled."I have wandered ever since--and am poorer now than when I
started.I left our boat at Puerto Nacional, to go to Medellin; and
from there to Remedios and Guamoco.But while in the river town I met
another _guaquero_--grave hunter, you know--who was preparing to go to
Honda, to investigate the 'castles' at that place.There is a strange
legend--you may have heard it--hanging over those rocks.It appears
that a lone hermit lived in one of the many caverns in the great
limestone deposits rising abruptly from the river near the town of
Honda.Day after day, year after year,
he labored in his cave, extending it further into the hillside.People
laughed at him for tunneling in that barren rock, for gold has never
been found anywhere in it.But the fellow paid them no attention; and
gradually he was accepted as a harmless fanatic, and was left
unmolested to dig his way into the hill as far as he would.No one knew how the fellow lived, for he held no human
intercourse.Kind people often brought food and left it at the mouth
of his cavern, but he would have none of it.They brought clothes, but
they rotted where they were left.At last some good soul planted a fig tree near the cave, hoping that
the fruit in time would prove acceptable to him.One day they found
the tree cut down._Bien_, time passed, and he was forgotten.One day
some men, passing the cave, found his body, pale and thin, with long,
white hair, lying at the entrance.when they buried
the body they found it was that of a woman!"He paused to draw some leaves of tobacco from his wallet and roll a
thick cigar.The sudden turn of his story drew an expression of
amazement from the priest."_Bien_," he resumed, "where the woman came from, and who she was,
never was learned.But of course some one must have
supplied her with food and clothes all these years.Perhaps she was
some grand dame, with a dramatic past, who had come there to escape
the world and do penance for her sins.What sorrow, what black tragedy
that cave concealed, no one may ever know!Nor am I at all interested
in that.The point is, either she found gold there, or had a quantity
of it that she brought with her--at least so I thought at the time.So, when the _guaquero_ at Puerto Nacional told me the story, nothing
would do but I must go with him to search the cave._Caramba!_ We
wasted three full months prying around there--and had our labor for
our pains!"He tilted his chair back and puffed savagely at his cigar."Well, then I got on the windy side of another legend, a wild tale of
buried treasure in the vicinity of Mompox.Spent six months pawing the hot dirt around that old town.Fell in
with your estimable citizen, Don Felipe, who swindled me out of a
hundred good _pesos oro_ on a fraudulent location and a forged map.Then I cursed him and the place and went up to Banco."Don Jorge went on:

"Your genial friend Diego is back there.Told me about his trip to
Simiti to see his little daughter.""What did he say about her, _amigo_?""Not much--only that he expected to send for her soon.You know,
Rosendo's daughter is living with him."But, Don Jorge," pursued Jose anxiously, "what think you, is the
little Carmen Diego's child?""_Hombre!_ How should I know?"She does not look like him," asserted Jose, clinging to his note of
optimism._Caramba_, but he looks like an imp
from sheol!"Jose saw that little consolation was to be derived from Don Jorge as
far as Carmen was concerned."_Bien_," continued Don Jorge, whose present volubility was in
striking contrast to his reticence on the boat the year before, "I had
occasion to come up to Bodega Central--another legend, if I must
confess it.And there Don Carlos Norosi directed me here.""Yes, no doubt it appears so to you, _Senor Padre_," replied Don
Jorge."And yet my business, that of treasure hunting, has in times
past proved very lucrative.The Indian graves of Colombia have yielded
enormous quantities of gold.The Spaniards opened many of them; and in
one, that of a famous chieftain, discovered down below us, near
Zaragoza, they found a solid gold pineapple, a marvelous piece of
workmanship, and of immense value.it never would have reached him if I had been there!"But," he resumed, "we have no idea of the amount of treasure that has
been buried in various parts of Colombia.This country has been, and
still is, enormously rich in minerals--a veritable gold mine of
itself.And since the time of the Spanish conquest it has been in a
state of almost constant turmoil.And, up to very recent times, whenever the people collected a bit of
gold above their daily needs, they promptly banked it with good Mother
Earth.Then, like as not, they got themselves killed in the wars, and
the treasure was left for some curious and greedy hunter like myself
to dig up years after.The Royalists and Tories buried huge sums all
over the country during the War of Independence.Why, it was only a
year or so ago that two men came over from Spain and went up the
Magdalena river to Bucaramanga.They were close-mouthed fellows,
well-dressed, and evidently well-to-do.But they had nothing to say to
anybody.The innkeeper pried around until he discovered that they
spent much time in their room poring over maps and papers.Then they
set off alone, with an outfit of mules and supplies to last several
weeks._Bueno_, they came back at last with a box of good size, made
of mahogany, and bound around with iron bands._Caramba!_ They did not
tarry long, you may be sure.And I learned afterward that they sailed
away safely from Cartagena, box and all, for sunny Spain, where, I
doubt not, they are now living in idleness and gentlemanly ease on
what they found in the big coffer they dug up near that old Spanish
city."To him, cooped up for a year and more in the
narrow confines of Simiti, the ready flow of this man's conversation
was like a fountain of sparkling water to a thirsty traveler.He urged
him to go on, plying him with questions about his strange avocation."_Caramba_, but the old Indian chiefs were wise fellows!""They seemed to know that greedy vandals like myself would
some day poke around in their last resting places for the gold that
was always buried with them--possibly to pay their freight across the
dark river.And so they dug their graves in the form of an L, in the
extreme tip of which the royal carcasses were laid.In this way they
have deceived many a grave-hunter, who dug straight down without
finding the body, which was safely tucked away in the toe of the L. I
have gone back and reopened many a grave that I had abandoned as
empty, and found His Royal Highness five or six feet to one side of
the straight shaft I had previously sunk.""I suppose," mused Jose, "that you now follow this work because of its
fascination--for you must have found and laid aside much treasure in
the years that you have pursued it.""_ ejaculated the _guaquero_."I have been rich and poor,
like the rising and setting of the sun!What I find, I spend again
hunting more.The man who has enough money
never knows it.And his greed for more--more that he needs not, and
cannot possibly spend on himself--generally results, as in my case, in
the loss of what he already has.But there are reasons aside from the
excitement of the chase that keep me at it."He fell strangely silent, and Jose knew that there were aroused within
him memories that seared the tissues of the brain as they entered."_Amigo_," Don Jorge resumed."There are some things which I am trying to forget.This exciting and
dangerous business of mine keeps my thought occupied.I care nothing
now for the treasure I may discover."Surely, good friend," replied Jose quickly; "and I ask pardon for
recalling those things to you.""_ said Don Jorge, with a gesture of deprecation.Then: "I told you on the boat that I had lost a wife and girl.I tell you this because I know you, too, have
grievances against her._Caramba!_ Yet I will tell you only a part.I
lived in Maganguey, where my wife's brother kept a store and did an
excellent commission business.I was mining and hunting graves in the
Cauca region, sometimes going up the Magdalena, too, and working on
both sides of the river.Maganguey was a convenient place for me to
live, as it stands at the junction of the two great rivers.Besides,
my wife wished to remain near her own people._Bien_, we had a
daughter.And then, one day, the priest
told my wife that the girl was destined to a great future, and must
enter a convent and consecrate herself to the Church._Caramba!_ I am
not a Catholic--was never one!My parents were patriots, and both took
part in the great war that gave liberty to this country.But they were
liberal in thought; and I was never confirmed to the Church._Bien_,
the priest made my life a hell--my wife became estranged from me--and
one day, returning from the Cauca, I found my house deserted.Wife and
girl and the child's nurse had gone down the river!"The man's face darkened, and hard lines drew around his mouth."They had taken my money chest, some thousands of pesos.He laughed at me, and--_Caramba_!I struck him such a blow
between his pig eyes that he lay senseless for hours!"Jose glanced at the broad shoulders and the great knots of muscle on
the man's arms.He was of medium height, but with a frame of iron."_Bien, Senor Padre_, I, too, fled wild and raving from Maganguey that
night, and plunged into the jungle.Months later I drifted down the
river, as far as Mompox.And there one day I chanced upon old
Marcelena, the child's nurse.Like a _cayman_ I seized her and dragged
her into an alley.She confessed that my wife and girl were living
there--the wife had become housekeeper for a young priest--the girl
was in the convent._Caramba!_ I hurled the woman to the ground and
turned my back upon the city!"Jose's interest in the all too common recital received a sudden
stimulus."Your daughter's name, Don Jorge, was--"

"Maria, _Senor Padre_.""And--she would now be, how old, perhaps?""Fair--complexion light, like her mother's.Maria was a beautiful
child--and good as she was beautiful.""But--the child's nurse remained with her?"The woman was
old and ugly--but she loved the child.""Did you not inquire for them when you were in Mompox a few months
ago?""I made slight inquiry through the clerk in the office of the
Alcalde.I did not intend to--but I could not help it._Caramba!_ He
made further inquiry, but said only that he was told they had long
since gone down to Cartagena, and nothing had been heard from them."The gates of memory's great reservoir opened at the touch of this
man's story, and Jose again lived through that moonlit night in
Cartagena, when the little victim of Wenceslas breathed out her life
of sorrow and shame in his arms.He heard again the sobs of Marcelena
and the simple-minded Catalina.He saw again the figure of the
compassionate Christ in the smoke that drifted past the window.And
now the father of that wronged girl sat before him, wrapped in the
tatters of a shredded happiness!Should he say
that he had cared for this man's little grandson since his advent into
this sense of existence that mortals call life?For there could be no
doubt now that the little Maria was his daughter."Don Jorge," he said, "you have suffered much.And yet--"

"_Na_, Padre, there is nothing to do.Were I to find my family I could
only slay them and the priests who came between us!""But, Don Jorge," cried Jose in horror, "you surely meditate no such
vengeance as that!""_Senor Padre_," he returned coldly, "I am
Spanish.The blood of the old cavaliers flows in my veins.I have been
betrayed, trapped, fooled, and my honored name has been foully soiled._Caramba!_
The priest of Maganguey who poured the first drop of poison into my
wife's too willing ears--_Bien_, I have said enough!""_Hombre!_ You don't mean--"

"I mean, _Senor Padre_, that I drifted down the river, unseen, to
Maganguey one night."_Na_, Padre, not God, but Satan!Don Jorge leaned forward and laid a hand
upon his knee."My friend," he said evenly, "you are young--how old,
may I ask?"_Bien_, you have much to learn.I took to you on
the boat because I knew you had made a mess of things, and it was not
entirely your fault.You are no more in
the Church than I am."I--I have--work here, senor," he replied."True," said Don Jorge, "a chance to do much for these poor people--if
the odds are not too strong against you.But--are you working for them
alone?Or--does Diego's child figure in the case?No offense, I assure
you--I have reason to ask."The man looked squarely into his own,
and the priest found no deception in their black depths."I--senor, she cannot be Diego's child--and I--I would save her!""_Bien_," he said, "to-morrow I leave for
San Lucas.After the evening meal the _guaquero_ spread his _petate_ upon the
floor and disposed himself for the night.He stubbornly refused to
accept the priest's bed."_ he muttered, after he had lain
quiet for some time, "why does not the Church permit its clergy to
marry, like civilized beings!Do you know, _Senor Padre_, I once met a
woman in Bogota and held some discussion with her on this topic.She
said, as between a priest who had children, and a married minister,
she would infinitely prefer the priest, because, as she put it, no
matter how dissolute the priest, the sacraments from his hands would
still retain their validity--but never from those of a married
minister!_Caramba!_ what can you do against such bigotry and awful
narrowness, such dense ignorance!The following morning, before sunrise, Don Jorge and his boatmen were
on the lake, leaving Jose to meditate on the vivid experiences of the
past few days, their strange mental origin, and the lesson which they
brought.CHAPTER 22


"Padre dear," said Carmen, "you know the question that we put under
the altar of the old church?Well, God answered it, didn't He?""I--why, I had forgotten it, child.You asked Him to tell
us why the people thought they had to die, did you not?"Why, He told us that they were frightened to death, you know."They paid the
penalty of death for believing that Feliz Gomez had slept on a bed
where a man had died of the plague.They died because they--"

"Because they didn't know that God was everywhere, Padre dear,"
interrupted Carmen.And yet," he
added sadly, "how are we going to make them know that He is
everywhere?""Why, Padre dear, by showing them in our talk and our actions that we
know it--by proving it, you know, just as we prove our problems in
algebra.""Yes, poor Feliz, and Amado, and Guillermo died because they sinned,"
he mused."They broke the first Commandment by believing that there
was another power than God.And that sin brought its inevitable wage,
death.They'missed the mark,' and sank into the oblivion of their
false beliefs.that I could keep my own mentality free from
these same carnal beliefs, and so be a true missionary to suffering
humanity!But you, Carmen, you are going to be such a missionary.And
I believe," he muttered through his set teeth, "that I am appointed to
shield the girl until God is ready to send her forth!But what, oh,
what will she do when she meets that world which lies beyond her
little Simiti?""The deposit will not last much
longer," he said to Jose, shaking his head dubiously."And then--"

"Why, then we will find another, Rosendo," replied the priest
optimistically."_ exclaimed the old man, starting for the trail.The day after Don Jorge's departure the Alcalde returned.He stole
shamefacedly through the streets and barricaded himself in his house.He cruelly abused his
long-suffering spouse, and ended by striking her across the face.After which he sat down and laboriously penned a long letter to Padre
Diego, in which the names of Jose and Carmen figured plentifully.For Don Jorge had met the Alcalde in Juncal, and had roundly jeered
him for his cowardly flight.He cited Jose and Rosendo as examples of
valor, and pointed out that the Alcalde greatly resembled a captain
who fled at the smell of gunpowder.Don Mario swelled with indignation
and shame.His spleen worked particularly against Rosendo and the
priest.Come what might, it was time Diego and his superiors in
Cartagena knew what was going on in the parish of Simiti!A few days later an unctuous letter came to Jose from Diego,
requesting that Carmen be sent to him at once, as he now desired to
place her in a convent and thus supplement the religious education
which he was sure Jose had so well begun in her.The priest had
scarcely read the letter when Don Mario appeared at the parish house."_Bien, Padre_," he began smoothly, but without concealing the malice
which lurked beneath his oily words, "Padre Diego sends for the little
Carmen, and bids me arrange to have her conveyed at once to Banco.I
think Juan will take her down, is it not so?""No, senor," he said in a voice
that trembled with agitation, "it is not so!""_ exclaimed Don Mario, swelling with suppressed rage."You
refuse to give Diego his own child?""No, _senor_, but I refuse to give him a child that is not his.""_Caramba!_ but she is--he has the proofs!And I shall send her to him
this day!"The Alcalde shrilled forth his rage like a ruffled parrot.Jose seized
him by the shoulders and, turning him swiftly about, pushed him out
into the road.He then entered the rear door of Rosendo's house and
bade Dona Maria keep the child close to her.A few minutes later Fernando Perez appeared at Jose's door.He was
municipal clerk, secretary, and constable of Simiti, all in one.He
saluted the priest gravely, and demanded the body of the child Carmen,
to be returned to her proper father.What could he do against the established
authority?"_Bien, Padre_," said Fernando, after delivering his message, "the
hour is too late to send her down the river to-day.But deliver her to
me, and she shall go down at daybreak.""Listen," Jose pleaded desperately, "Fernando, leave her here
to-night--this is sudden, you must acknowledge--she must have time to
take leave of Dona Maria--and--"

"_Senor Padre_, the Alcalde's order is that she go with me now.Scarce knowing what he did, he
quickly stepped back through the rear door, and going to Rosendo's
house, seized a large _machete_, with which he returned to face the
constable."Look you, Fernando," he cried, holding the weapon menacingly aloft,
"if you lay a hand on that girl, I will scatter your brains through
yonder _plaza_!""_ muttered the constable, falling back."_Bien_," he
hastily added, "I will make this report to the Alcalde!"But he hastily arose and went into Rosendo's
house.he cried excitedly, "leave Carmen with me, and do
you hurry through the town and see if Juan is here, and if Lazaro
Ortiz has returned from the _hacienda_.Bid them come to me at once,
and bring their _machetes_!"Jose seized his _machete_ firmly in
one hand, and with the other drew Carmen to him.the child asked, her eyes big with wonder.I wish you wouldn't always go around thinking
that two and two are seven!""Carmen, child--you do not understand--you are too young, and as yet
you have had no experience with--with the world!"I do _not_ trust you, Padre," she said sadly."I can't trust anybody
who always sees things that are not so.""Carmen--you are in danger--and you do not comprehend--" cried the
desperate man."I am _not_ in danger--and I _do_ understand--a great deal better than
you do, Padre.People who are afraid
die of the plague!"The irony of her words sank into his soul."No, senor," the lad replied."She is searching for you--have you your _machete_?""Yes, Padre, I have just come back from the island, where I was
cutting wood."He went to the door and looked eagerly down the street.he
exclaimed with relief, "here come Dona Maria and Lazaro!Now,
friends," he began, when they were assembled before him, "grave danger
threatens--"

"Padre!"he cried, "go at once to the Boque trail!Let no one pass
that way with Carmen, if your life be the penalty!If either of you see her, call loudly, and I will come!Dona
Maria, start through the town!*       *       *       *       *

The afternoon dragged its interminable length across the valley.Jose
wearily entered his house and threw himself upon a chair.He had not
dared call at the Alcalde's house, for fear he might do that official
violence.But he had seen Fernando in the street, and had avoided him.Then, of a sudden, a thought came to him from out the darkness.He
sprang to his feet and hurried off toward the shales.There, beneath
the stunted _algarroba_ tree, sat the child.He rushed to her and clasped her in his arms."Padre," she replied, when she could get her breath, "I had to come
out here and try to know for you the things you ought to know for
yourself."He said nothing; but, holding her hand tightly, he led her back to the
house.That evening Jose sent for Don Mario, the constable, and Juan and
Lazaro.Assembling them before him in his living room, he talked with
them long and earnestly."_Compadres_," he said, "this week we have passed through a sad
experience, and the dark angel has robbed us of three of our beloved
friends.Is it your wish that death again visit us?"The Alcalde scowled darkly at
the priest beneath his heavy brows.Jose continued:

"_Bien_, it is planned to seize the little Carmen by force, and send
her down the river to Padre Diego--"

_"Dios y diablo!The Alcalde shrank back in his chair."Padre Diego sends for her by
letter--is it not so, Don Mario?"Juan wheeled about and stared menacingly at the
bulky official."Now, friends," Jose pursued, "it has not been shown that Carmen
belongs to Diego--in fact, all things point to the conclusion that she
is not his child.My wish is to be just to all concerned.But shall we
let the child go to him, knowing what manner of man he is, until it is
proven beyond all doubt that he is her father?""And I am of the opinion that the majority of our citizens would
support us in the contention."Every man in Simiti, Padre," replied Lazaro earnestly."Don Mario," said Jose, turning to the Alcalde, "until it is
established that Diego has a parent's claim to the girl, Juan and
Lazaro and I will protect her with our lives.Is it not so, _amigos_?""_Hombre!_ Let me see a hand laid upon her!"I
know you to be q good man--not like Padre Diego.I know not what claim
he may have on the girl, but this I say: I will follow and support you
until it is shown me that you are in the wrong."Then, to the town officials:

"_Bien, amigos_, we will let the matter rest thus, shall we not?If harm comes to the child, the death
angel will again stalk through this town, and--" he looked hard at Don
Mario, whilst that official visibly shrank in size--"_Bien_," he
concluded, "a sharp watch will be kept over the child.We will submit
to proofs--but to nothing less.cried Don Mario, at last finding his voice."If
Diego has the Bishop back of him, he will force us to deliver the
girl--or the Bishop will have the government soldiers sent here!I can
ask for them--and if necessary I will!"Don Mario,
seeing that his words had taken effect, quickly followed up the
advantage."Now you, Juan and Lazaro, do you think the little whelp
worth that?"The words were scarcely out of his mouth when Juan leaped across the
floor and fell upon him.Jose seized the lad and, with Fernando's
help, tore him loose.Lazaro held his _machete_ aloft, ready to
strike.Jose's voice rang out sharply:

"Hold, men!Juan, do you stay here
with me!"The lad faced the Alcalde and shook his fist."_Bien_," he sputtered,
"send for the soldiers, fat dog that you are!But when I see them
crossing the lake, I will come first to your house and cut open that
big belly!"shrilled the Alcalde, shaking with rage."I will cut off the hand that is laid on Juan!"And for
God's sake think twice before you make any further move!"Don Mario and his constable departed in sullen silence.Jose let
Lazaro out through the rear door, while he bade Juan pass the night in
the parish house.A consultation was held with Dona Maria, and it was
arranged that Carmen should sleep in the room with Jose, with Juan
lying before the door, until Rosendo should return from the mountains.Then Jose sat down and wrote to the Bishop.*       *       *       *       *

No reply came from Cartagena until Rosendo returned at the end of the
month.Meanwhile, Jose had never for a moment permitted Carmen to
leave his side.The child chafed under the limitation; but Jose and
Dona Maria were firm.Juan lived with the priest; and Lazaro lurked
about the parish house like a shadow.The Alcalde and his constable
remained discreetly aloof.But with Rosendo's return came letters from both Wenceslas and Diego.The latter had laid aside his unction, and now made a curt and
peremptory demand upon Jose for the child.The letter from Wenceslas
was noncommittal, stating only that he was quite uninformed of Diego's
claim, but that an investigation should be made.Jose wondered if he
had blundered in laying the case before him."_ ejaculated Rosendo, when he heard Jose's story.And now the Bishop has the matter in hand!_Caramba!_ We
shall lose her yet!"And, Padre," he added, "the deposit is played out.And, now that we shall have none to send to the Bishop
each month, Carmen's fate is settled--unless we go away.He hung his head
and sat in gloomy dejection.For more than a year Rosendo had panned the isolated alluvial deposit,
and on his regular monthly returns to Simiti he and the priest had
sent from thirty to ninety _pesos_ gold to Wenceslas.To this Jose
sometimes added small amounts collected from the people of Simiti,
which they had gratuitously given him for Masses and for the support
of the parish.Wenceslas, knowing the feeble strength of the parish,
was surprised, but discreet; and though he continually urged Jose to
greater efforts, and held out the allurements of "indulgences and
special dispensations," he made no inquiries regarding the source of
the monthly contributions.For many days following, Rosendo and the priest went about as in a
thick, black cloud."Rosendo," said Jose at length, "go back to the
mountains and search again.Have we any reason
to doubt Him now?""And leave Carmen here, exposed to the danger that always hangs over
her?I would not go back now even if the deposit were
not worked out!Jose knew it would be futile to urge him.Carmen came to the priest that same day."Padre, I heard you and padre
Rosendo talking this morning."Why, child--there seems to be a need just at present," he replied
lightly."But we might--well, we might send another of your questions
to God.she cried delightedly, turning at once and hurrying away
for pencil and paper."Now," she panted, seating herself at the table."Let us see; we want
Him to give us _pesos_, don't we?""Well, you know, Padre dear," she replied seriously, "we can't ask for
too much--for we already have everything, haven't we?After all, we
can only ask to see what we really already have."Say 'yes,' Padre dear," she pleaded, looking up appealingly at him
staring silently at her.Oh, if she could only impart to him even a
little of her abundant faith!"Well, here it is," she said, holding out the paper.He took it and read--"Dear, dear God: Padre Jose needs _pesos_--lots
of them."And now," she continued, "shall we put it under the altar of the old
church?"He smiled; but immediately assumed an expression of great seriousness."Why not in the church here, the one we are using?"But--no, we will go where we went before," she concluded firmly.Taking matches and a piece of candle, he set off
with the girl in a circuitous route for the hill, which they gained
unobserved.Within the musty old church he struck a light, and they
climbed over the _debris_ and to the rear of the crumbling altar."Here is my other question that He
answered!She drew the old paper from beneath the adobe brick."Let us put this question in a new place," she said."Look,
up there, where the bricks have fallen out," pointing to the part of
the altar that had crumbled away.His thought was far
off, even in Cartagena, where sat the powers that must be held quiet
if his cherished plans were not to fail.He reached out and grasped
one of the projecting bricks to steady himself.As he did so, the
brick, which was loose, gave way with him, and he fell, almost across
Carmen, followed by a shower of rubbish, as another portion of the old
altar fell out."_ he ejaculated, picking himself up."What good luck that
the candle was not extinguished!And now, senorita, are you willing
that we should bury this important question here on the floor; or must
I again try to put it in the altar itself?""Up there," insisted the child, laughing and still pointing above.He rose and looked about, searching for a convenient place to deposit
the paper.Then something attracted his attention, something buried in
the altar, but now exposed by the falling out of the fresh portion.It
was metal, and it glittered in the feeble candle light.He reached in
and hastily scraped away more of the hard mud.Then, trembling with
suppressed excitement, he pulled out another brick.Clearly, it was a
box that had been buried in there--who knows when?He gave the candle
to Carmen and bade her stand up close.Then with both hands he
carefully removed the adjacent bricks until the entire box was in
view."A box to put our question in,
Padre!"muttered the excited priest,
straining and tugging away at it."Now--" He gave a final pull.A crash of falling bricks
followed; the candle was extinguished; and both he and the child were
precipitated to the floor.called the priest, choking with dust, "are you hurt?""No, Padre dear," came the laughing answer through the darkness."But
I'm pretty full of dust.It lay near, a small, wooden coffer,
bound about with two narrow bands of steel.He dragged it out and bore
it down the aisle to the door, followed by Carmen.He dusted it off and examined it carefully in the fast fading light.It was some twelve inches square by three deep, well made of mahogany,
and secured by a small, iron padlock.On the top there was a crest of
arms and the letters, "I de R," burned into the wood.Night had closed in, and the priest and girl made their way hurriedly
back home by way of the lake, to avoid being seen.Under his cassock
Jose carried the box, so heavy that it chafed the skin from his hip as
they stumbled along."Carmen, say nothing--but tell your padre Rosendo to come to me at
once!"With the doors secured, and Carmen and Dona Maria standing guard
outside to apprise them of danger, Jose and Rosendo covertly examined
the discovery.pondered Rosendo, studying the box.Then--"_Caramba!_
Padre--_Caramba!_ It is _Ignacio de Rincon!_ _Hombre!_ And the
crest--it is his!I have seen it before--years and years ago!_Caramba!_ _Caramba!_" The old man danced about like a child.he kept exclaiming, his eyes
big as saucers.Then, hastening out to get his iron bar, he returned
and with a blow broke the rusty padlock.Tearing open the hinged
cover, he fell back with a loud cry.Before their strained gaze, packed carefully in sawdust, lay several
bars of yellow metal.Rosendo took them out with trembling hands and
laid them upon the floor._Caramba!--_

"Hold these, Padre!"hurrying out and returning with a pair of
homemade wooden balances.Again and again he carefully weighed the
bars.It seemed to Jose that the old man
wasted hours arriving at a satisfactory result."Padre," he finally announced in tones which he strove vainly to
control, "there cannot be less than six thousand _pesos oro_ here!""Six thousand _pesos_--twenty-four thousand
francs!The trembling old man replaced the bars and carried them to Jose's
bed.The priest opened the door and called to Carmen."What was in the old box, Padre?"she asked happily, bounding into the
room.He stooped and picked her up, almost crushing her in his arms."The
answer to your question, _chiquita_.'Before they call I will answer:
and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.'"CHAPTER 23


When Jose awoke the next morning he quickly put his hand under his
pillow.He
drew it forth and raised the cover.The yellow bars glittered in the
morning rays sifting through the overhanging thatch at the window.He
passed his hand gently across them.His heart leaped within him as he hastily threw on his scant
attire and went out into the balsamic air of the tropical morning.Rosendo had gone to the village of Boque, starting before sun-up, so
Dona Maria announced.Some sudden impulse had seized him, and he had
set out forthwith, not stopping to discuss the motive with his
faithful consort.Jose concluded his _desayuno_, and then summoned
Carmen to the parish house for the day's lessons.She came with a song
on her lips."Don't stop, _chiquita_!Sing it again--it is beautiful; and my soul
drinks it in like heavenly dew!"he cried, as the child danced up to
him and threw her plump arms about his neck.She turned about and sat down on the dusty threshold and repeated the
little song.The glittering sunlight streamed through her rich curls
like stringers of wire gold.Cucumbra came fawning to her and nestled
at her little bare feet, caressing them at frequent intervals with his
rough tongue.Cantar-las-horas approached with dignified tread, and,
stopping before his adored little mistress, cocked his head to one
side and listened attentively, his beady eyes blinking in the dazzling
light.Had
either of her parents been so gifted?And yet, it was
only the voicing of a soul of stainless purity--a conscience clear as
the light that gilded her curls--a trust, a faith, a knowledge of
immanent good, that manifested daily, hourly, in a tide of happiness
whose far verge melted into the shore of eternity.As he sat with
closed eyes the adobe hut, with its dirt floor and shabby furnishings,
expanded into a castle, hung with richest tapestries, rarest pictures,
and glittering with plate of gold.The familiar odors of garlic and
saffron, which penetrated from the primitive kitchen of Dona Maria,
were transmuted into delicate perfumes.The sun drew nearer, and
suffused him with its glittering flood.The girl became a white-robed
vision, and her song a benediction, voicing "Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace among men of good will."The song ended, and left the thought with him: "To men of good will?"Yes, to men of God's will--the will that is good--to men of sound
mind--that mind which was in Christ Jesus--the mind that knows no
evil!"_Chiquita_," the priest said gently, when the girl returned to him."Your question was quickly answered yesterday, was it not?""It was answered, Padre, before we asked
it.God has the answers to all questions that could ever be asked.We
would always know the answers if we thought the way He does.""But--tell me, _chiquita_, do you think He put that little box up
there in the altar purposely for us?""No, Padre--I guess it was hidden there by some man, long ago, who was
afraid he would lose it.And since he was afraid he would lose it,
why--he did, for now we have it.""Yes, the thing that he greatly feared came upon him.But what is your
idea regarding the way we happened to find it?"God leads to everything good, Padre dear," was the simple response.But, in this particular case--would we have been led to
the little box if you had not asked your question of God?"People are always led right when they think right.""And so thinking right was the cause of this discovery, was it?"he
pursued, relentlessly probing her thought to its depths."Why--yes, Padre--of course.We had to have money--you said so, you
know.And you told me to ask for lots of _pesos_.Well, we both knew
that God had already given us more _pesos_ than we could ever know
what to do with--He always does.He just can't help giving Himself to
everybody.And He gave Himself to us--why, we have always had Him!We
are _in_ Him, you know.And when anybody just knows that--why, he sees
nothing but good everywhere, and he always has all that he needs.""All that he wants, you mean, _chiquita_?""No, Padre, not all that he wants.You might
want all the gold in the world--but you wouldn't need it.""No, that would be only a selfish, human want.But--you still think we were led right to the little box, do you?""I know it, Padre dear," she replied emphatically."When we think
good, we see good.It is just as sure as
getting the right answers to my problems in algebra when I think right
about them.""And thinking right about them means using the right rule, does it
not?"If I didn't use the right rule--why, what sort of
answers would I get?But still," vigorously pursuing the subject,
"you don't think we happened upon the little box just by good luck?""Padre," she shook her curls insistently, "things never happen,
_never_!"Yes, there surely does seem to be a definite law of cause and effect.But you did not think gold yesterday, _chiquita_.""Oh, Padre dear, what a bother you are!No, I didn't think gold
yesterday.And that is
gold and everything else that we need.And it wasn't
just because I thought good yesterday, but because I think good every
day, that I saw the gold.It was because we needed it, and God had
already given us all that we needed.And I knew that it just _had_ to
come.Then, because we really needed it, and knew that
it was right and that it must come--well, it did.Her
little face was very serious as she looked up appealingly into his."Yes, _chiquita_, yes, I see.I just wanted to know how you would
explain it.It becomes clearer to me every day that there are no such
things as miracles--never were!Christ Jesus _never_ performed
miracles, if by that we mean that he set aside God's laws for the
benefit of mankind.But he acted in perfect accord with those
laws--and no wonder the results seemed miraculous to dull-witted human
minds, who had always seen only their coarse, material thought
externalized in material laws and objects, in chance, mixed good and
evil, and a God of human characteristics!""Yes--I--guess so, Padre dear--only, I don't understand your big
words.""Ah, _chiquita_, you understand far, far better than I do!Why, I am
learning it all from you!And Jose had learned by this time, too, that between merely
recognizing righteousness as right-thinking, and actually practicing
it--putting it to the test so as to "prove" God--there is a vast
difference.Things cannot be "thought" into existence, nor evils
"thought" away--the stumbling block of the mere tyro in the study of
mental cause and effect.A vast development in spirituality must
precede those "signs following" before mankind shall again do the
works of the Master.Jose knew this; and he bowed in humble
submission, praying for daily light.*       *       *       *       *

At dusk Rosendo returned."_Bien_, Padre, I have it now, I think!"he
cried excitedly, pacing back and forth in the little room.Come, while we eat I will tell you!"The little group gathered about the table, while Rosendo unfolded his
theory."I went to Boque this morning to talk with Dona Lucia.She is very
aged, the oldest inhabitant in these parts._Bien_, I knew that she
had known Don Ignacio, although she was not his slave.Her story
brought back to me also the things my father had often told me about
Don Ignacio's last trip to Simiti.Putting all these things together,
I think I now know how the little box came to be hidden in the altar
of the old church."The old man's eyes sparkled with happiness, while his auditors drew
closer about him to drink in his dramatic recital.For Rosendo, like a
true Latin, reveled in a wonder-tale.And his recitals were always
accompanied by profuse gesticulation and wonderful facial expressions
and much rolling of the eyes."_Bien_," he continued, "it was this way.Don Ignacio's possessions in
Guamoco were enormous, and in the then prosperous city of Simiti he
had stores and warehouses and much property.When the War of
Independence neared its end, and he saw that the Royalist cause was
lost, he made a last and flying trip to Simiti, going up the Magdalena
river from Cartagena in his own _champan_, propelled by some of his
still faithful slaves."_Bien_, he found that one of his foremen had just returned from the
mountains with the final clean-up from La Libertad _arrastras_.These
had been abandoned, for most of the slaves had deserted, or gone to
fight the Spaniards.But the foreman, who was not a slave, but a
faithful employe, had cleaned up the _arrastras_ and hidden the
amalgam until he could find a favorable opportunity to come down to
Simiti with it."Now, when Don Ignacio arrived here, he found the town practically
deserted.So he and the foreman retorted the amalgam and melted the
gold into bars.But, just as they had completed their task, a
messenger came flying to town and reported that a body of Royalist
soldiers were at Badillo, and that they had learned that Simiti was
the _bodega_ of the rich Guamoco district, and were preparing to come
over and sack the town.They were fleeing down the river to the coast,
to get away to Spain as soon as possible, but had put off at Badillo
to come over here.Fortunately, they had become very intoxicated, and
their expedition was for that reason delayed."_Bueno_, at the news the foreman dropped everything and fled for his
life.A few people gathered with the priest in the Rincon church, the
one you are using now, Padre.The priest of the other old church on
the hill fled._Caramba_, but he was a coward--and he got well paid
for it, too!"Don Ignacio's _champan_ was at Badillo, and he had come across to
Simiti by canoe._Bien_, he dared not take this gold back with him;
and so he thought of hiding it in one of the churches, for that is
always a sacred place.There were people in his own church, and so he
hurried to the one on the hill.Evidently, as he looked about in the
deserted building for a place to hide the bars, he saw that some of
the bricks could easily be removed from the rear of the altar.A
couple of hours sufficed to do the work of secreting the box.Then he
fled across the shales to the town of Boque, where he got a canoe to
take him down to the Magdalena; and there he waited until he saw the
soldiers come across and enter the _cano_.Don Nicolas, son of Dona Lucia, was his boatman, and he says that he
remained with your grandfather at that place over night, and that
there they received the report that the Royalists had been terribly
whipped in the battle--the battle of--_Caramba_!I forget--"

"Of Ayacucho," suggested Jose."_Bien_, there was nothing for the poor
man to do but hasten down the river to Cartagena as fast as possible,
for he knew not what might have befallen his family.He did not dare
go back to Simiti then for the box.And so the gold was left in the
altar.""Now I understand what he meant by that
note in his old diary, which we had in my father's house, in Spain!Arriving in Cartagena he went at once to the Department of
Mines and tore out all the pages of the register that contained
descriptions of his mineral properties.He intended some day to return
to Guamoco and again locate them.And meantime, he protected himself
by destroying all the registered locations.It was easy for him to do
this, influential as he was in Cartagena.And doubtless at that stormy
time the office of the Department of Mines was deserted.This note,
Rosendo, I have read in his old diary, many times, but never knew to
what it referred.""_Bueno_, the soldiers sacked Simiti
and slaughtered all the people they could find.Then they set fire to
the town, and left."But now for the old church and the picture of the Virgin that was
lost during the terrible storm when the priest fell dead.We will have
to guess that later, when peace had been restored, the priest of the
old church in prying around the altar discovered the loose bricks and
the box behind them._Bueno_, the night of the awful storm he had gone
secretly to the church to remove the box.I remember that my father
said the priest had arranged for my father to take him down to Bodega
Central the very next day.You see, he was going to flee with the
gold, the rogue!_Bien_, while he was in the church taking out the
loose bricks, that storm broke--and, from what I remember, it was
terrible!The heavens were ablaze with lightning; the thunder roared
like cannon; and the lake rose right out of its bed!_Caramba!_ The
door of the church crashed open, and the wind whistled in and blew out
the candles on the altar.The wind also tore loose a beautiful picture
of the Virgin that was hanging near the altar.The picture was blown
out of its frame and swept off to the hills, or into the lake.It was
never seen again, although the frame was found just outside the door.Perhaps it was the extinguishing of the candles and the falling of the
picture that frightened the old priest so terribly.At any rate he ran
from the church to his house, and when he reached his door he fell
dead of apoplexy."_Bueno_, after that you could never get any of the Simiti people to
enter the church again.They closed the doors and left it, just as it
was, for they thought the curse of God had fallen upon it because it
had been erected by the enemies of the Rincon family, whose patron
saint was the blessed Virgin herself.Well, the old altar began to
crumble, and parts of it fell away from time to time.And when the
people heard the bricks falling they said it was the bad angel that
the Virgin had locked in there--the angel of Satan that had
extinguished the candles on the altar that night of the storm._Caramba!_ And I believed it, too!I am a fool, Padre, a fool!""We are all fools, Rosendo, when we yield ourselves to superstition
and false belief," said Jose solemnly."But you have worked out a very
ingenious story, and I doubt not you have come very near to accounting
in the right way for the presence of the little box in the altar.But
now, _amigo_, come with me to my house."It is this, Rosendo," he said, when they were alone."We now have
gold, and the way has been providentially opened.Carmen is in great
danger here.What say you, shall we take her and leave Simiti?""Padre," he said at length, "you are right.It would be best for her
if we could get her away.But--you would have to leave the country.I
see now that neither she nor you would be safe anywhere in Colombia if
you left Simiti.""And I am sure that no country
offers the asylum that America does--the America of the north.I
have never been there, _amigo_; but of all countries I learn that it
is the most tolerant in matters religious.And it offers the
greatest opportunities to one, like Carmen, just entering upon life.And, Rosendo, prepare yourself and Dona Maria at
once, for we had best start without delay.""No, Padre," he said slowly.I could
not go to the North with you; nor could Maria."exclaimed the priest impatiently, "why?""_Bien_, Padre, we are old.And we know not the language of those up
there.We could not adapt ourselves to their ways of
life--no, not at our age.You tell me they have cold, ice, snow, up there."_Bien_, Padre, do you go, and take the girl.Bring her up to be a
power for good in that great land.We--Maria and I--will remain in
Simiti.It is not permitted that we should ever leave.This has always
been our home, and here we will die.""No, Padre, we could not make so great a change.Anywhere in Colombia
would be but little different from Simiti.But up north--in that great
country where they do those wonderful things you have told me
about--no, Padre, Maria and I could not make so great a change."But, Padre," he continued, "what will you do--leave the Church?Or
will you still be a priest up there?"In the great joy which the
discovery of the gold had stimulated, and in the thought of the
possibilities opened by it, he had given no heed to his status
respecting the Church.Yet, if he remained in the Church, he could not
make this transfer without the approval of the Vatican.And that, he
well knew, could not be obtained.No, if he went, he must leave behind
all ecclesiastical ties.And with them, doubtless, the ties which
still bound him to his distant mother and the family whose honored
name he bore.It was not so easy a matter to take the girl and leave
Simiti, now that he gave the project further consideration.And yet he could not abandon the idea, however great his present sense
of disappointment.He would cling to it as an ideal, some day to be
realized, and to be worked up to as rapidly as might be, without
exciting suspicion, and without abruptly severing the ties which, on
serious reflection, he found he was not morally strong enough as yet
to break."_Bien_, Rosendo," he concluded in chastened tones."We will think it
over, and try to devise ways to accomplish the greatest good for the
child."The way will be shown us some time,
Padre!""And while we wait, we will keep our eyes open,
no?"Yes, Jose would keep his eyes open and his heart receptive.After
all, as he meditated the situation in the quiet of his little cottage
that evening, he was not sorry that circumstances kept him longer in
Simiti.For he had long been meditating a plan, and the distraction
incident upon a complete change of environment certainly would delay,
if not entirely defeat, its consummation.He had planned to
translate his Testament anew, in the light of various works on
Bible criticism which the explorer had mentioned, and which the
possession of the newly discovered gold now made attainable.He had
with him his Greek lexicon.He would now, in the freedom from
interruption which Simiti could and probably would afford for the
ensuing few months, give himself up to his consecrated desire to
extract from the sacred writings the spiritual meaning crystallized
within them.The vivid experiences which had fallen to him in
Simiti had resulted in the evolution of ideas--radically at variance
with the world's materialistic thought, it is true--which he was
learning to look upon as demonstrable truths.The Bible had slowly
taken on a new meaning to him, a meaning far different from that
set forth in the clumsy, awkward phrases and expressions into which
the translators so frequently poured the wine of the spirit, and
which, literally interpreted, have resulted in such violent
controversies, such puerile ideas of God and His thought toward man,
and such religious hatred and bigotry, bloodshed, suffering, and
material stagnation throughout the so-called Christian era.He would
approach the Gospels, not as books of almost undecipherable
mystery, not as the biography of the blessed Virgin, but as
containing the highest human interpretation of truth and its relation
to mankind."I seek knowledge," he repeated aloud, as he paced back and forth
through his little living room at night; "but it is not a knowledge
of Goethe, of Kant, or Shakespeare; it is not a knowledge of the
poets, the scientists, the philosophers, all whom the world holds
greatest in the realm of thought; it is a knowledge of Thee, my
God, to know whom is life eternal!Men think they can know Homer,
Plato, Confucius--and so they can.But they think they can _not_
know Thee!And yet Thou art nearer to us than the air we breathe, for
Thou art Life!What is there out in the world among the multifold
interests of mankind that can equal in importance a demonstrable
knowledge of Thee?Not the unproven theories and opinions, the
so-called 'authority' of the ancient Fathers, good men though they
may have been; not modern pseudo-science, half-truths and relative
facts, saturated with materialism and founded on speculation and
hypothesis; but real knowledge, a knowledge of Thee that is as
demonstrable as the simplest rule in mathematics!that men
should be so mesmerized by their own beliefs as to say Thou canst
not be known.for the burden which such thinkers as Spencer
have laid upon the shoulders of stumbling mankind.For God _can_ be
known, and proven--else is Jesus responsible for the most cruel lie
ever perpetrated upon the ignorant, suffering world!"And so, putting aside a portion of his gold--his by right of
inheritance as well as discovery--for the future purchase of such
books and aids as he might require, Jose set his house in order and
then plunged into such a search of the Scriptures as rendered him
oblivious to all but the immediate interests of Carmen and her
foster-parents.The great world again narrowed into the rock-bound
confines of little Simiti.Each rushing morn that shot its fiery glow
through the lofty treetops sank quickly into the hush of noon, while
the dust lay thick, white, and hot on the slumbering streets of the
ancient town; each setting sun burned with dreamy radiance through the
afternoon haze that drew its filmy veil across the seething valley;
each night died into a stillness, lonely and awful.Nature changed her
garb with monotonous regularity; the drowsing children of this tropic
region passed their days in dull torpidity; Jose saw nothing of it
all.At times a villager would bring a tale of grievance to pour into
his ears--perhaps a jaguar had pounced upon his dog on his little
_finca_ across the lake, or a huge snake had lured a suckling pig into
its cavernous maw.At times a credulous woman would stop before his
open door to dilate upon the thick worms that hung upon the leaves of
the _algarrobas_ and dropped their wool-like fibers upon the natives
as they passed below, causing intermittent fevers.Perhaps an anxious
mother would seek him for advice regarding her little son, who had
eaten too much dirt, and was suffering from the common "_jipitera_,"
that made his poor little abdomen protrude so uncomfortably.Again,
Rosendo might steal in for a few moments' mysterious, whispered talk
about buried treasure, or the fables of El Dorado and Parime.Jose had
time for them all, though as he listened his thought hovered ever
about the green verge of Galilee.By his side worked Carmen, delving assiduously into the mysteries
of mathematics and the modern languages.When the day's work closed
for them both, he often asked her to sing to him.And then, leaning
back with closed eyes, he would yield himself to the soft dreams
which her sweet voice called up from his soul's unfathomed depths.Often they walked together by the lake on a clear night; and on
these little excursions, during which they were never beyond
Rosendo's watchful eye, Jose reveled in the girl's airy gaiety and
the spontaneous flow of her sparkling thought.He called her his
domestic sunbeam; but in his serious moments--and they were
many--he studied her with a wistful earnestness, while he sought to
imbibe her great trust, her fearlessness, her unswerving loyalty to
the Christ-principle of immanent Good.He would never permit
restraint to be imposed upon her, even by Rosendo or his good wife.She knew not what it was to be checked in the freest manifestation
of her natural character.But there was little occasion for
restraint, for Carmen dwelt ever in the consciousness of a spiritual
universe, and to it paid faithful tribute.She saw and knew only
from a spiritual basis; and she reaped the rewards incident thereto.His life and hers were such as fools might label madness, a
colorless, vegetative existence, devoid of even the elemental
things that make mundane existence worth the while.But the
appraisal of fools is their own folly.Jose knew that the torrid
days which drew their monotonous length over the little town were
witnessing a development in both himself and the child that some day
would bear richest fruit.So far from being educated to distrust
spiritual power, as are the children of this world, Carmen was
growing up to know no other.Instead of the preponderance of her
belief and confidence being directed to the material, she was
developing the consciousness that the so-called evidence of the
physical senses is but mortal thought, the suppositional opposite of
the thought of the infinite God who says to mankind: "For I know the
thoughts that I think toward you, thoughts of peace and not of
evil, to give you an expected end."Jose knew that his method of
education was revolutionary.But he also knew that it was not
wholly his; that the child had really taken this course herself,
as if led thereto by a power beyond them both.And so he watched her, and sought to learn from her as from Christ's
own loving and obedient disciple.It was because of his obedience to
God that Jesus was able to "prove" Him in the mighty works which we
call miracles.He said, "If any man will do His will, he shall know of
the doctrine, whether it be of God."And Carmen
did do His will; she kept the very first Commandment; she walked by
faith, and not by the sight of the human senses.She had been called
an "_hada_," a witch, by the dull-witted folk of Simiti; and some day
it would be told that she had a devil.But the Master had borne the
same ignominy.And so has every pioneer in Truth, who has dared to lay
the axe at the roots of undemonstrable orthodox belief and entrenched
human error.Jose often trembled for the child when he thought of the probable
reception that awaited her in the world without, in case she ever
left Simiti.Would her supreme confidence in good ever be weakened by
an opposite belief in evil?Would her glorious faith ever be
neutralized or counterbalanced by faith in a power opposed to God?And sometimes in the fits of abstraction resulting from
these thoughts, the girl would steal up to him and softly whisper,
"Why, Padre, are you trying to make two and two equal seven?"Then he
would laugh with her, and remember how from her algebraic work she had
looked up one day and exclaimed, "Padre--why, all evil can be reduced
to a common denominator, too--_and it is zero_!"As recreation from the task of retranslating his Greek Testament, Jose
often read to Carmen portions from the various books of the Bible, or
told her the old sacred stories that children so love to hear.But
Carmen's incisive thought cut deep into them, and Jose generally found
himself hanging upon the naive interpretations of this young girl.When, after reading aloud the two opposing accounts of the Creation,
as given in the first and second chapters of Genesis, she asked, "But,
Padre, why did God change His mind after He made people and gave them
dominion over everything?"Jose was obliged to say that God had not
made a mistake, and then gone back afterward to rectify it; that the
account of the Creation, as given in Genesis, was not His, but was a
record of the dawning upon the human thought of the idea of the
spiritual Creation; that the "mist" which went up from the earth was
suppositional error; and that the record of the Creation which follows
after this was only the human mind's interpretation of the real,
spiritual Creation, that Creation which is the ever unfolding of
infinite Mind's numberless, perfect ideas.The book of Genesis has
been a fetish to human minds; and not until the limitations imposed by
its literal interpretation were in a measure removed did the human
mentality begin to rise and expand.And when, reading from Isaiah, the
grandest of the ancient prophets, the ringing words, "Cease ye from
man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be
accounted of?"the child asked him if that did not refer to the very
kind of people with whom they had daily intercourse, he had been
obliged to say that it did, and that that sort of man was far, very
far, from being the man of God's own creating."The mist, child, which is mentioned in the second chapter of Genesis,
is said to have gone up from the ground.That is, it went up from
matter.And so it is typical of materialism, from which all evil
comes.The material is the direct opposite of the spiritual.Every bit
of evil that men think they can see, or know, or do, comes as
testimony of the five material senses.These might well be called the
'ground' senses.In the book of Genesis, you will notice that the
account of the real comes first; then follows the account of its
opposite, the unreal man of dust.""The plus sign is followed by a minus
sign, isn't it?And the man made of dust is the real man with a minus
sign before him.""The man of dust is the human mind's interpretation of the spiritual
man, dear child," returned Jose."All human beings are interpretations
by the mortal, or human, mind of infinite Mind, God, and His spiritual
Creation.The interpretation is made in the human mind, and remains
there.The human mind does not see these interpretations outside of
itself--it does not see real men, and houses, and trees, outside of
itself--but it sees its mental interpretations of God, which it calls
men, and houses, and trees, and so on.These things are what we might
call _mental concepts_.They are the man and the creation spoken of in
the second chapter of Genesis after the mist went up from matter, from
the ground, from materialism, resulting in the testimony of the
physical senses.""But, Padre, they are not real--these mental concepts?"They are formed in mentalities that are
themselves wrong interpretations of the infinite Mentality, called
God.They are made up
of false thoughts, false opinions, beliefs of power opposed to God,
beliefs in evil, in sickness, disaster, loss, and death.They are the
results of educated and inherited and attached beliefs.They are
largely made up of fear-beliefs.The human mentalities see these
various beliefs combined in what it calls men and women, houses,
animals, trees, and so on, all through the material so-called
creation.It is this wrong interpretation that has caused all the
suffering and sorrow in the world.And it is this false stuff that the
good man Jesus finally said he had overcome.""How did he do it, Padre?""By knowing its nothingness, and by knowing the Allness of his Father,
infinite Mind.He called this false stuff a lie about God.And he
overcame that lie by knowing the truth--just as you overcome the
thought that you cannot solve your algebraic problems by knowing the
truth that will and does solve them.""But, Padre, you said once that Jesus was the best man that ever
lived.That is, the human minds all about him saw their
mental concepts of him as a man.But he was a human concept that most
clearly represented God's idea of Himself.Mortal, human minds are
like window-panes, _chiquita_.When a window-pane is very dirty, very
much covered with matter, only a little light can get through it.Some
human minds are cleaner, less material, than others, and they let more
light through.Jesus was the cleanest mind that was ever with us.He
kept letting more and more light--Truth--through himself, until at
last all the matter, even the matter composing the material concept
that people called his earthly body, dissolved in the strong light,
and the people saw him no more."And--Padre, don't we have to do that way, too?"We must, every one of us, do exactly as Jesus
did.We must wash ourselves clean--wash off the dirty beliefs of power
apart from God; we must wash off the beliefs of evil as a power,
created in opposition to Him, or permitted by Him to exist and to use
His children; we must wash off beliefs of matter as real and created
by Him.We must know that matter and all evil, all that decays and
passes away, all discord and disease, everything that comes as
testimony of the five physical senses, is but a part of the lie about
Him, the stuff that has the minus sign before it, making it less than
nothing.We must know that it is the suppositional opposite of the
real--it is an illusion, seeming to exist, yet evaporating when we try
to define it or put a finger on it, for it has no rule or principle by
which it was created and by which it continues to exist.No, Jose assured himself, the Gospels are not "loose, exaggerated,
inaccurate, credulous narratives."They are the story of the clearest
transparency to truth that was ever known to mortals as a human being.They preserve the life-giving words of him whose mission it was to
show mankind the way out of error by giving them truth.They contain
the rule given by the great Mathematician, who taught mankind how to
solve their life-problems.They tell the world plainly that there
seems to exist a lie about God; that every real idea of the infinite
Mind seems to have its suppositional opposite in a material illusion.They tell us plainly that resisting these illusions with truth renders
them nugatory.They tell us clearly that the man Jesus was so filled
with truth that he proved the nothingness of the lie about God by
doing those deeds that seemed marvelous in the eyes of men, and yet
which he said we could and should do ourselves.And we must do them,
if we would throw off the mesmerism of the lie.The human concept of
man and the universe must dissolve in the light of the truth that
comes through us as transparencies.And it were well if we set about
washing away the dirt of materialism, that the light may shine through
more abundantly.Jesus did not say that his great deeds were accomplished contrary to
law, but that they fulfilled the law of God.Ignorance of
spiritual law permits the belief in its opposite, material law, or
laws of matter.False, human beliefs, opinions, and theories, material
speculations and superstitions, parade before the human mind as laws.Jesus swept them all aside by knowing that their supposed power lay
only in human acceptance.The human mind is mesmerized by its own
false thought.Even Paul at times felt its mesmerism and exclaimed:
"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with
me."The very idea of good stirs up its opposite in the human
consciousness.But Paul rose above it and saw its nothingness.Then
he cried: "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made
me free from the law of sin and death."He recognized the spiritual
law that Jesus employed; and with it he overcame the mesmerism of
the lie."To be a Christian, then," said Jose, "means not merely taking the
name of Christ, and, while morally opposing sin, succumbing to every
form of mesmerism that the lie about God exerts.It means recognizing the nature of God and His Creation,
including Man, to be wholly spiritual--and the nature of the material
creation and mankind as their opposite, as mental concepts, existing
as false interpretations of the spiritual Universe and Man, and as
having their place only in the false human consciousness, which itself
is a mental activity concerned only with false thought, the
suppositional opposite of God's thought.It means taking this Truth,
this spiritual law, as we would take a mathematical rule or principle,
and with it overcoming sin, sickness, discord of every name and
nature, even to death itself.What, oh, what have so-called Christians
been doing these nearly two thousand years, that they have not ere
this worked out their salvation as Jesus directed them to do?they have been mesmerized--simply mesmerized by the lie.The
millennium should have come long, long ago.It would come to-day if
the world would obey Jesus.But it will not come until it does obey
him."Day after day, week after week, month after month, Jose delved and
toiled, studied and pondered.The books which he ordered through the
Empresa Alemania, and for which for some two months he waited in
trembling anticipation and fear lest they be lost in transit, finally
arrived.When Juan brought them up from Bodega Central, Jose could
have wept for joy.Except for the very few letters he had received at
rare intervals, these were the only messages that had penetrated the
isolation of Simiti from the outside world in the two long years of
his exile.They afforded
his first introduction to that fearlessly critical thought regarding
things religious which has swept across the world like a tidal wave,
and washed away so many of the bulwarks of superstition and ignorance
bred of fear of the unknown and supposedly unknowable.And yet they were not really his first introduction to that
thought, for, as he pored over these books, his heart expanded
with gratitude to the brusque explorer whom he had met in Cartagena,
that genial, odd medley of blunt honesty, unquibbling candor, and
hatred of dissimulation, whose ridicule of the religious fetishism
of the human mentality tore up the last root of educated orthodox
belief that remained struggling for life in the altered soil of his
mind.But, though they tore down with ruthless hand, _these books did not
reconstruct_.He could understand why the trembling heart, searching wearily for
truth, turned always from such as they with sinking hope.They were
violently iconoclastic--they up-rooted--they overthrew--they swept
aside with unsparing hand--but they robbed the starving mortal of his
once cherished beliefs--they snatched the stale and feebly nourishing
bread from his mouth, and gave nothing in return.They emptied his
heart, and left it starving.What did it boot to tell a man that the
orthodox dream of eternal bliss beyond the gates of death was but a
hoax, if no substitute be offered?Why point out the fallacies, the
puerile conceptions, the worse than childish thought expressed in the
religious creeds of men, if they were not to be replaced by
life-sustaining truth?If the demolition of cherished beliefs be not
followed by reconstruction upon a sure foundation of demonstrable
truth, then is the resulting state of mind worse than before, for the
trusting, though deceived, soul has no recourse but to fall into the
agnosticism of despair, or the black atheism of positive negation."Happily for me," he sighed, as he closed his books at length, "that
Carmen entered my empty life in time with the truth that she hourly
demonstrates!"CHAPTER 24


Days melted into weeks, and these in turn into months.Simiti, drab
and shabby, a crumbling and abandoned relique of ancient Spanish pride
and arrogance, drowsed undisturbed in the ardent embrace of the
tropical sun.Don Jorge returned, unsuccessful, from his long quest in
the San Lucas mountains, and departed again down the Magdalena river."It is a marvelous country up there," he told Jose."I do not wonder
that it has given rise to legends.I felt myself in a land of
enchantment while I was roaming those quiet mountains.When, after
days of steady traveling, I would chance upon a little group of
natives hidden away in some dense thicket, it seemed to me that they
must be fairies, not real.I came upon the old trail, Padre, the
_Camino Real_, now sunken and overgrown, which the Spaniards used.It used to lead down to Cartagena."Ah, Padre, what quartz veins I saw in that country!Gold
will be discovered there without measure some day!This map which Don Carlos gave me is much in error.Jose regretfully saw
him depart, for he had grown to love this ruggedly honest soul.Meantime, Don Mario sulked in his house; nor during the intervening
year would he hold anything more than the most formal intercourse with
the priest.Events move with
terrible deliberation in these tropic lands, and men's minds are heavy
and lethargic.Jose assumed that Don Mario had failed in the support
upon which he had counted; or else Diego's interest in Carmen was
dormant, perhaps utterly passed.Each succeeding day of quiet
increased his confidence, while he rounded out month after month in
this sequestered vale on the far confines of civilization, and the
girl attained her twelfth year.Moreover, as he noted with marveling,
often incredulous, mental gaze her swift, unhindered progress, the
rapid unfolding of her rich nature, and the increasing development of
a spirituality which seemed to raise her daily farther above the plane
on which he dwelt, he began to regard the uninterrupted culmination of
his plans for her as reasonably assured, if not altogether certain.Juan continued his frequent trips down to Bodega Central as general
messenger and transportation agent for his fellow-townsmen, meanwhile
adoring Carmen from a distance of respectful decorum.Rosendo and
Lazaro, relaxing somewhat their vigilance over the girl, labored
daily on the little _hacienda_ across the lake.The dull-witted
folk, keeping to their dismally pretentious mud houses during the
pulsing heat of day, and singing their weird, moaning laments in the
quiet which reigned over this maculate hollow at night, followed
undeviatingly the monotonous routine of an existence which had no
other aim than the indulgence of the most primitive material wants."Ah, Padre," Rosendo would say of them, "they are so easy!They love
idleness; they like not labor.They fish, they play the guitar, they
gather fruits.Padre, it is sad, is
it not?"Aye, thought the priest, doubly sad in its mute answer to the
heartlessly selfish query of Cain.No one, not even the Church, was
the keeper of these benighted brothers.He alone had constituted
himself their shepherd.And as they learned to love him, to confide
their simple wants and childish hopes to him, he came to realize the
immense ascendency which the priests of Colombia possess over the
simple understanding of the people.An ascendency hereditary and
dominant, capable of utmost good, but expressed in the fettering of
initiative and action, in the suppression of ambition, and the
quenching of every impulse toward independence of thought.How he
longed to lift them up from the drag of their mental encompassment!Yet how helpless he was to afford them the needed lustration of soul
which alone could accomplish it!"I can do little more than try to set them a standard of thought,"
he would muse, as he looked out from the altar over the camellia-like
faces of his adult children when he conducted his simple Sunday
services."I can only strive to point out the better things of
this life--to tell them of the wonders of invention, of art, of
civilization--I can only relate to them tales of romance and
achievement, and beautiful stories--and try to omit in the recital all
reference to the evil methods, aims, and motives which have manifested
in those dark crimes staining the records of history.The world
calls them historical incident and fact.I must call them 'the mist
that went up from the ground and watered the face of the earth.'"But Jose had progressed during his years in Simiti.It had been
hard--only he could know how hard!--to adapt himself to the narrow
environment in which he dwelt.It had been hard to conform to these
odd ways and strange usages.But he now knew that the people's
reserve and shyness at first was due to their natural suspicion of
him.For days, even weeks, he had known that he was being weighed and
watched.It is true, the dull staring of the natives of this unkempt town had
long continued to throw him into fits of prolonged nervousness.They
had not meant to offend, of course.But at hardly any hour of the day or night could he look up
from his work without seeing dark, inquisitive faces peering in
through the latticed window or the open door at him, watchful of the
minutest detail of his activity.And he
had grown used to their thoughtless intrusion upon him at any hour.He
had learned, too, not to pale with nausea when, as was their wont of
many centuries, the dwellers in this uncouth town relentlessly pursued
their custom of expectorating upon his floor immediately they entered
and stood before him.He had accustomed himself to the hourly
intrusion of the scavenger pigs and starving dogs in his house.And he
could now endure without aching nerves the awful singing, the maudlin
wails, the thin, piercing, falsetto howls which rose almost nightly
about him in the sacred name of music.For these were children with
whom he dwelt.And he was trying to show them that they were children
of God.Already Jose had
been obliged to supplement his oral instruction with texts purchased
for her from abroad.Her grasp of the English language was his daily
wonder.After two years of study she spoke it readily.She loved it,
and insisted that her conversations with him should be conducted
wholly in it.French and German likewise had been taken up; and her
knowledge of her own Castilian tongue had been enriched by the few
books which he had been able to secure for her from Spain.Jose's anomalous position in Simiti had ceased to cause him worry.What mattered it, now that he had endeared himself to its people, and
was progressing undisturbed in the training of Carmen?And he, in
turn, knew that upon his observance of them depended his tenure of the
parish.And he wanted to remain among them, to lead them, if possible, at
least a little way along what he was daily seeing to be the only path
out of the corroding beliefs of the human mind.He knew that his
people's growth would be slow--how slow might not his own be, too!Who
could say how unutterably slow would be their united march heavenward!And yet, the human mind was expanding with wonderful rapidity in
these last days.What acceleration had it not acquired since that
distant era of the Old Stone Man, when through a hundred thousand
years of darkness the only observable progress was a little greater
skill in the shaping of his crude flint weapons!To Padre Diego's one or two subsequent curt demands that Carmen be
sent to him, Jose had given no heed.And perhaps Diego, absorbed in
his political activities as the confidential agent of Wenceslas, would
have been content to let his claim upon the child lapse, after many
months of quiet, had not Don Jorge inadvertently set the current of
the man's thought again in her direction.For Don Jorge was making frequent trips along the Magdalena river.It
was essential to his business to visit the various riverine towns and
to mingle freely with all grades of people, that he might run down
rumors or draw from the inhabitants information which might result in
valuable clues anent buried treasure.Returning one day to Simiti from
such a trip, he regaled Jose with the spirited recital of his
experience on a steamboat which had become stranded on a river bar."_Bien_," he concluded, "the old tub at last broke loose.Then we saw
that its engines were out of commission; and so the captain let her
drift down to Banco, where we docked.I was forced, not altogether
against my will, to put up with Padre Diego.But I had much amusement at his expense when I twitted him about his
daughter Carmen, and his silly efforts to get possession of her!"he cried, "why can
you not let sleeping dogs alone?Diego is not the man to be bearded
like that!Would that you had kept away from the subject!And what did
you say to him about the girl?"I only told him how beautiful she was, and how large
for her few years._Bien_, I think I said she was the most beautiful
and well-formed girl I had ever seen.But was there anything wrong in
telling the truth, _amigo_?""No," replied Jose bitterly, as he turned away; "you meant no harm.But, knowing the man's brutal nature, and his assumed claim on the
girl, why could you not have foreseen possible misfortune to her in
dwelling thus on her physical beauty?_Hombre_, it is too bad!""_Na_, _amigo_," said Don Jorge soothingly, "nothing can come of it.But when Don Jorge again set out for
the mountains he left the priest's heart filled with apprehension.A few weeks later came what Jose had been awaiting, another demand
upon him for the girl.Failure to comply with it, said Diego's letter,
meant the placing of the case in the hands of the civil and
ecclesiastical authorities for action.Rosendo's face grew hard when he read the note."There is a way,
Padre.Let my woman take the girl and go up the Boque river to Rosa
Maria, the clearing of Don Nicolas.It is a wild region, where tapirs
and deer roam, and where hardly a man has set foot for centuries.The
people of Boque will keep our secret, and she can remain hidden there
until--"

"No, Rosendo, that will not do," replied Jose, shaking his head in
perplexity."The girl is developing rapidly, and such a course would
result in a mental check that might spell infinite harm.She and Dona
Maria would die to live by themselves up there in that lonely region."Then do you go too, Padre," suggested Rosendo."No, _amigo_, for that would cause search to be instituted by the
Bishop, and we certainly would be discovered.But, to take her
and flee the country--and the Church--how can I yet?He shook his head dolefully, while his thoughts flew
back to Seville and the proud mother there."_Bien_, Padre, let us increase our contributions to Don Wenceslas.Let us send him from now on not less than one hundred _pesos oro_ each
month.Will not that keep him quiet, no matter what Diego says?""At any rate, we will try it."They still
had some three thousand _pesos_ gold left.*       *       *       *       *

"Padre," said Rosendo, some days later, as they sat together in the
parish house, "what do you think Diego wants of the girl?""I think, Rosendo--" he began.But could even a human
mind touch such depths of depravity?And yet--"I think," he continued
slowly, "that Diego, having seen her, and now speculating on her
future beauty of face and form--I think he means to place her in a
convent, with the view of holding her as a ready substitute for the
woman who now lives with him--"

"_Dios_!And, if I mistake not, Diego also would like to
repay the score he has against you, for driving him from Simiti and
holding the threat of death over him these many years.He can most
readily do this by getting Carmen away from you--as he did the other
daughter, is it not so?"His face was strained with
fearful anxiety."Padre," he said in a low voice, "I shall end this
matter at once.I go to Banco to-morrow to kill Diego.""Why--Rosendo, it would mean your own death, or lifelong
imprisonment!""I
have nothing that is not hers, even to my life.Gladly would I give it
for her.Let me die, or spend my remaining days in the prison, if that
will save her.Such a price for her safety would be low."While he was speaking, Fernando, the town constable, entered.He
saluted the men gravely, and drew from his pocket a document to which
was attached the Alcalde's official seal."Senores," he said with much dignity, as if the majesty of his little
office weighed upon him, "I am commanded by Senor, the Alcalde, to
exercise the authority reposing in him and place Don Rosendo Ariza
under arrest.You will at once accompany me to the _carcel_," he
added, going up to the astonished Rosendo and laying a hand upon his
shoulder.cried the old man, stepping
back."_Bien_, _amigo_, I do not find it my duty to tell you.The Senor
Alcalde hands me the document and commands me to execute it.As for
the cause--_Bien_, you must ask him.""Come," said Jose, the first to recover from his astonishment, "let us
go to him at once."He at any rate had now an opportunity to confront
Don Mario and learn what plans the man had been devising these many
months.The Alcalde received the men in his little _patio_, scowling and
menacing.He offered them no greeting when they confronted him."Don Mario," asked Jose in a trembling voice, "why have you put this
indignity upon our friend, Rosendo?"Ask, rather, _Senor Padre_," replied the Alcalde, full of wrath,
"what alone saves you from the same indignity.Only that you are a
priest, _Senor Padre_, _nada mas_!His arrest is ordered by Padre
Diego.""And why, if I may beg the favor?"pursued Jose, though he well knew
the sordid motive.Why lay the hands of the law upon those who deprive a
suffering father of his child!_Bien_, _Fernando_," turning to the
constable, "you have done well.Take your prisoner to the _carcel_.""No, Don Mario, I will not go to
the jail!I will--"

"_Caramba!_" shouted the Alcalde, his face purple."I set your trial
for to-morrow, in the early morning.But this night you will spend in
the jail!_Hombre!_ I will see if I am not Alcalde here!And look you,
_Senor Padre_, if there is any disturbance, I will send for the
government soldiers!Then they will take Rosendo to the prison in
Cartagena!Jose knew that, if Diego had the support of the Bishop, this was no
idle threat."What shall I
do, Padre?""It is best that you go to the jail to-night, Rosendo," said Jose with
sinking heart."But, Don Mario," turning menacingly to the Alcalde,
"mark you, his trial takes place in the morning, and he shall be
judged, not by you alone, but by his fellow-townsmen!""Have I not said so, senor?"returned Don Mario curtly, with a note of
deep contempt in his voice.As in most small Spanish towns, the jail was a rude adobe hut, with no
furnishings, save the wooden stocks into which the feet of the hapless
prisoners were secured.Thus confined, the luckless wight who chanced
to feel the law's heavy hand might sit in a torturing position for
days, cruelly tormented at night by ravenous mosquitoes, and wholly
dependent upon the charity of the townsfolk for his daily rations,
unless he have friends or family to supply his needs.In the present
instance Don Mario took the extra precaution of setting a guard over
his important prisoner.Jose, benumbed by the shock and bewildered by the sudden precipitation
of events, accompanied Rosendo to the jail and mutely watched the
procedure as Fernando secured the old man's bare feet in the rude
stocks.And yet, despite the situation, he could not repress a sense
of the ridiculous, as his thought dwelt momentarily on the little
_opera bouffe_ which these child-like people were so continually
enacting in their attempts at self-government.But it was a play that
at times approached dangerously near to the tragic.The passions of
this Latin offshoot were strong, if their minds were dull and
lethargic, and when aroused were capable of the most despicable, as
well as the most grandly heroic deeds.And in the present instance,
when the fleeting sense of the absurd passed, Jose knew that he was
facing a crisis.Something told him that resistance now would be
useless.True, Rosendo might have opposed arrest with violence, and
perhaps have escaped.But that would have accomplished nothing for
Carmen, the pivot upon which events were turning.Jose had reasoned
that it were better to let the Alcalde play his hand first, in the
small hope that as the cards fell he might more than match his
opponent's strength with his own."_Na_, Padre, do not worry," said Rosendo reassuringly."It is for her
sake; and we shall have to know, as she does, that everything will
come out right.My friends will set me free to-morrow, when the trial
takes place.And then"--he drew the priest down to him and whispered
low--"we will leave Simiti and take to the mountains."Arriving at Rosendo's house, he
saw the little living room crowded with sympathetic friends who had
come to condole with Dona Maria.That placid woman, however, had not
lost in any degree her wonted calm, even though her companions held
forth with much impassioned declamation against the indignity which
had been heaped upon her worthy consort.She was not with her foster-mother, nor did his inquiry reveal her
whereabouts.He smiled sadly, as he thought of her out on the shales,
her customary refuge when storms broke.He started in search of her;
but as he passed through the _plaza_ Manuela Cortez met him."Padre,"
she exclaimed, "is the little Carmen to go to jail, too?""Manuela--why do you say that?"he asked
hurriedly, his heart starting to beat like a trip-hammer."Because, Padre, I saw the constable, Fernando, take her into Don
Mario's house some time ago."Jose uttered an exclamation and started for the house of the Alcalde.Don Mario stood at the door, his huge bulk denying the priest
admission."Carmen--you have her here?"Fernando, who had been sitting just within the door, rose and came to
his chief's side.Fernando stepped
outside and took his arm.The Alcalde's unlovely face expanded in a
sinister leer."It is permissible to place even a priest in the
stocks, if he becomes _loco_," he said significantly.Fernando spoke quickly:

"It was necessary to take the girl in custody, too, Padre.But do not
worry; she is safe.""But--you have no right to take her--"

"There, _Senor Padre_, calm yourself.What right had you to separate
her from her father?"And, Don Mario, you have no
authority but his--"

"You mistake, _Senor Padre_," calmly interrupted the Alcalde.he muttered, scarce hearing
his own words."The Bishop's, _Senor Padre_," answered Don Mario, with a cruel grin.But--the old man--"

"_Na_, _Senor Padre_, but the Bishop is fairly young, you know.That
is, the new one--"

"The new one!""To be sure, _Senor Padre_, the new Bishop--formerly Senor Don
Wenceslas Ortiz."Jose beat the air feebly as his hand sought his damp brow."_Bien_, _Senor Padre_," put in Fernando gently, pitying the priest's
agony.The old Bishop of Cartagena died suddenly some days ago, and Don
Wenceslas at once received the temporary appointment, until the
vacancy can be permanently filled.There is talk of making Cartagena
an archbishopric, and so a new bishop will not be appointed until that
question is settled.Meanwhile, Don Wenceslas administers the affairs
of the Church there.""And he--he--" stammered the stunned priest."To be sure, _Senor Padre_," interrupted Don Mario, laughing aloud;
"the good Don Wenceslas no doubt has learned of the beautiful Carmen,
and he cannot permit her to waste her loveliness in so dreary a place
as Simiti.And so he summons her to Cartagena, in care of his agent,
Padre Diego, who awaits the girl now in Banco to conduct her safely
down the river.At least, this is what Padre Diego writes me._Bien_,
it is the making of the girl, to be so favored by His Grace!"Jose staggered and would have fallen, had not Fernando supported him.But as he went he spitefully hurled
back:

"_Bien_, _Senor Padre_, whom have you to blame but yourself?You keep
a child from her suffering father--you give all your time to her,
neglecting the other poor children of your parish--you send Rosendo
into the mountains to search for La Libertad--you break your
agreement with me, for you long ago said that we should work
together--is it not so?You find gold in the mountains, but you do
not tell me._Na_, you work against me--you oppose my authority as
Alcalde--_Bien_, you opposed even the authority of the good
Bishop--may he rest with the Saints!You have not made a good priest
for Simiti, _Senor Padre_--_na_, you have made a very bad one!And
now you wonder that the good Don Wenceslas takes the girl from you,
to bring her up in the right way.if it is not already too
late to save her from your bad teachings!"His voice steadily rose
while he talked, and ended in a shrill pipe.Jose made as if to reach him; but Fernando held him back.The Alcalde
got quickly within the house and secured the door."Go now to your
home, Padre," urged Fernando; "else I shall call help and put you in
the stocks, too!"shouted
Jose desperately, struggling to gain the Alcalde's door.cried Fernando, holding to the frenzied man."The little Carmen--she is not in there!"Then where is she, Fernando?--for God's sake tell
me!"Great beads of perspiration stood
upon his face, and tears rolled down his drawn cheeks."_Bien_, Padre," he said gently;
"come away.I give you my word that the girl is not in the house of
the Alcalde.But I am not permitted to say where she is.""Then I will search every house in Simiti!""_Na_, Padre, you would not find her.He took Jose's arm again and led him, blindly stumbling, to the parish
house.By this time the little town was agog with excitement.People ran from
house to house, or gathered on the street corners, discussing the
event."_Caramba!_" shrilled one wrinkled beldame, "but Simiti was very quiet
until the _Cura_ came!""_Na_, senora," cried another, "say, rather, until that wicked little
hada was brought here by Rosendo!""_Cierto_, she is an _hada_!"put in a third; "she cured Juanita of
goitre by her charms!I myself saw her come from
the old church on the hill one day!_Bien_, what was she doing?I say,
she was talking with the bad angel which the blessed Virgin has locked
in there!""Yes, and I have seen her coming from the cemetery.She talks with the
buzzards that roost on the old wall, and they are full of evil
spirits!""And she brought the plague two years ago--who knows?"But it was not the real plague, anyway.""_Bueno_, and that proves that she caused it, no?""_Cierto_, _senora_, she cast a spell on the town!"Jose sat in his little house like one in a dream.Dona Maria had gone to the jail to see Rosendo.Juan had
returned that morning to Bodega Central, and Lazaro was at work on the
plantation across the lake.Jose thought bitterly that the time had
been singularly well chosen for the _coup_.Don Mario's last words
burned through his tired brain like live coals.In a sense the Alcalde
was right.He had been selfishly absorbed in the girl.But he alone,
excepting Rosendo, had any adequate appreciation of the girl's real
nature.To the stagnant wits of Simiti she was one of them, but with
singular characteristics which caused the more superstitious and less
intelligent to look upon her as an uncanny creature, possessed of
occult powers.Moreover, Jose had duped Don Mario with assurances of cooeperation.He
had allowed him to believe that Rosendo was searching for La Libertad,
and that he should participate in the discovery, if made.Had his
course been wholly wise, after all?it was all to save an innocent child from the blackest
of fates!If he had been stronger himself, this never could have
happened.Or, perhaps, if he had not allowed himself to be lulled to
sleep by a fancied security bred of those long months of quiet, he
might have been awake and alert to meet the enemy when he returned to
the attack.the devil had left him for a season, and Jose had
laid down "the shield of faith," while he lost himself in the
intellectual content which the study of the new books purchased with
his ancestral gold had afforded.But evil sleeps not; and with a
persistency that were admirable in a better cause, it returned with
unbated vigor at the moment the priest was off his guard.*       *       *       *       *

Dawn broke upon a sleepless night for Jose.The Alcalde had sent word
that Fernando must remain with the priest, and that no visits would be
permitted to Rosendo in the jail.Jose had heard nothing from Carmen,
and, though often during the long night he sought to know, as she
would, that God's protection rested upon her; and though he sought
feebly to prove the immanence of good by knowing no evil, the morning
found him drawn and haggard, with corroding fear gnawing his desolate
heart.Fernando remained mute; and Dona Maria could only learn that
the constable had been seen leading the girl into Don Mario's house
shortly after Rosendo's arrest.At an early hour the people, buzzing with excitement, assembled for
the trial, which was held in the town hall, a long, empty adobe house
of but a single room, with dirt floor, and a few rough benches.The
Alcalde occupied a broken chair at one end of the room.The trial
itself was of the simplest order: any person might voice his opinion;
and the final verdict was left to the people.In a shaking voice, his frame tremulous with nervous agitation,
Rosendo recounted the birth of the child at Badillo, and the manner of
her coming into his family.He told of Diego's appointment to Simiti,
and of the loss of his own daughter.Waxing more and more energetic as
his recital drew out, he denounced Diego as the prince of liars, and
as worthy of the violent end which he was certain to meet if ever that
renegade priest should venture near enough for him to lay his hands
upon him.The little locket was produced, and all present commented on
the probable identity of the girl's parents.Many affected to detect a
resemblance to Diego in the blurred photograph of the man.Don Mario swore loudly that it could be no other.Diego had often talked to him, sorrowfully, and in terms of deepest
affection, about the beautiful woman whose love he had won, but whom
his vows of celibacy prevented from making his lawful wife.The
Alcalde's recital was dramatic to a degree, and at its close several
excitedly attempted to address the multitude at the same time.Oratory flowed on an ever rising tide, accompanied by much violent
gesticulation and expectoration by way of emphasis.At length it was
agreed that Diego had been, in times past, a bad man, but that the
verbal proofs which he had given the Alcalde were undoubtedly valid,
inasmuch as the Bishop stood behind them--and Don Mario assured the
people that they were most certainly vouched for by His Grace.The day
was almost carried when the eloquent Alcalde, in glowing rhetoric,
painted the splendid future awaiting the girl, under the patronage of
the Bishop.How cruel to retain her in dreary little Simiti, even
though Diego's claim still remained somewhat obscure, when His Grace,
learning of her talents, had summoned her to Cartagena to be educated
in the convent for a glorious future of service to God!Ah, that a
like beautiful career awaited all the children of Simiti!Jose at length forced himself before the people and begged them to
listen to him.But, when he opened his mouth, the words stumbled and
halted.To tell these people that he was
striving to educate the girl away from them was impossible.To say
that he was trying to save her from the Church would be fatal.And to
reiterate that Diego's claim was a fabrication, added nothing of value
to the evidence, for what did he know of the child's parentage?He
feebly begged them to wait until Diego's claim had been either
corroborated or annulled.But no; they had the Bishop's corroboration,
and that sufficed.cried Don Mario, interrupting the
priest in a loud voice, "if we oppose the Bishop, then will he send
the government soldiers to us--and you know what--"

"_Cielo_, yes!"The case now
rested with her God.The people drew apart in little groups to discuss the matter.Don
Mario's beady eyes searched them, until he was certain of the way the
tide was flowing."_Bueno_, _amigos y amigas_," he began with immense dignity; "what say
you if we sum up the case as follows: The proofs have the support of
the Bishop, and show that the girl is the daughter of Padre Diego.Rosendo is guilty of having kept her from her own father, and for that
he should be severely punished.Let him be confined in the jail for
six months, and be forced to pay to us a fine of one thousand _pesos
oro_--"

"_Caramba_!but he has no such sum," cried the people with mouths
agape."_Bien_, I say he can get it!"retorted the Alcalde, looking meaningly
at Jose."And he should pay it for depriving the child of a father's
love and the religious instruction which he would have given her!""Will you not remember that more than that amount is due Rosendo for
the care of the child?The whimsical, fickle people broke into excited exclamations."_Cierto!_"

"The _Cura_ is right!""Let Rosendo pay no fine--he has no gold, anyway!"The Alcalde saw that he had gone a bit too far."_Bueno_, then," he
amended."We will cancel both the fine and Padre Diego's debt to
Rosendo, and the sentence shall be reduced to--what say you all?""A month in the jail, Don Mario, no more," suggested one.An exclamation of approval from the crowd drowned the protest which
Jose sought vainly to voice.Rosendo rose quickly; but Fernando and
others seized him."_Bien_, it is approved," bawled the Alcalde, waving his thick arms."Take the prisoner to the _carcel_, _Senor Policia_," turning to the
constable."And the girl, Senor the Alcalde--when will you send her to her
father?""Yes, Don Mario, she must be taken to Padre Diego at once," piped a
woman's shrill voice."_Bien_," shouted the Alcalde, following his words with a long, coarse
laugh, "I was wise enough to know what you would decide, and sent the
girl down the river last night!"CHAPTER 25


The candles and smoky oil lamps of Banco threw a fitful shimmer out
upon the great river, casting huge, spectral shadows across its muddy,
swirling waters, and seeming rather to intensify the blackness that
lay thick and menacing upon its restless bosom.Rivermen who follow
their hazardous calling along the Magdalena do not lightly risk the
dangers of travel by night in their native canoes, when at any moment
a false stroke, a sudden crash against a tossing forest tree, and a
cry through the inky blackness, might sound to the straining ears of
hushed listeners on the distant banks the elements of another of the
mighty river's grim nocturnal tragedies.But on the night following the trial of Rosendo in distant Simiti a
canoe stole like a thing ashamed through the heavy shadows along the
river's margin, and poked its blunt nose into the ooze at the upper
edge of the town.Its two scantily clad _bogas_, steaming with
perspiration and flecked with mud from the charged waters, sprang
lightly from the frail craft and quickly made it fast to one of the
long stilts upon which a ramshackle frame house rested.Then they
assisted the third occupant of the canoe, a girl, to alight; and
together they wended their way up the slippery bank and toward the
town above."_Caramba_, _compadre_!"ejaculated one of the men, stumbling into a
deep rut, "it is well you know where we go.but I travel no
more on the river by night.And, _compadre_, we had best ask Padre
Diego to offer a candle to the Virgin for our safe arrival, no?"Don Diego has much
influence with virgins.""_Bien, amigo_, what would you?You are well paid; and besides, you
score against that baby-faced priest, Jose, who drove you out of
Simiti because you were not married to your woman.You cannot
complain, _compadre_.""_Caramba!_ I have yet to see the color of the _pesos_.I do not much
trust your Padre Diego.""_Na, amigo_, a bit of rum will put new life into your soaked gizzard._Cierto_, this trip down the river was a taste of purgatory; but you
know we may as well get used to it here, for when we _pobres_ are dead
who will buy Masses to get us out?""_Caramba!_" muttered the other sullenly, as he stumbled on through
the darkness, "but if we have no money the priests will let us burn
forever!"The girl went along with the men silently and without complaint, even
when her bare feet slipped into the deep ruts in the trail, or were
painfully bruised and cut by the sharp stones and bits of wood that
lay in the narrow path.The man addressed as Julio
assisted her to her feet.The other broke into a torrent of profane
abuse."_Na, Ricardo,_" interrupted Julio, "hold your foolish tongue and let
the girl alone!You and I have cursed all the way from Simiti, but she
has made no complaint._Caramba_, I wish I were well
out of this business!"A few minutes later they struck one of the main thoroughfares.Then
the men stopped to draw on their cotton shirts and trousers before
entering the town.The road was better here, and they made rapid
progress.The night was far spent, and the streets were deserted.In
the main portion of the town ancient Spanish lamps, hanging
uncertainly in their sconces against old colonial houses, threw a
feeble light into the darkness.Before one of the better of these
houses Julio and the girl were halted by their companion."_Bien_," he said, "it is here that the holy servant of God lives._Caramba_, but may his _garrafon_ be full!"They entered the open door and mounted the stone steps.On the floor
above they paused in the rotunda, and Ricardo called loudly.A side
door opened and a young woman appeared, holding a lighted candle
aloft."_El Senor Padre, senorita
Ana?_" he said, bowing low."You will do us the favor to announce our
arrival, no?"The woman stared uncomprehendingly at the odd trio."The Padre is not
here," she finally said."_Dios y diablo!_" cried Ricardo, forgetting his courtesy."But we
have risked our skins to bring him the brat, and he not here to
receive and reward us!_Caramba!_"

"But--Ricardo, he is out with friends to-night--he may return at any
moment.She stepped
forward, holding the candle so that its light fell full upon her face.As she did this the girl darted toward her and threw herself into the
woman's arms.she cried, her voice breaking with emotion, "Anita--I am
Carmen!The little Carmen,
my father's--"

"Yes, Anita, I am padre Rosendo's Carmen--and yours!"Ana clasped the girl in her arms.What brings
you here, of all places?""As you may see, senorita, it is
we who have brought her here, at the command of her father, Padre
Diego."And, since you say he is not in, we must wait until he
returns."Carmen clung to her, while
Ricardo stood looking at them, with a foolish leer on his face.Julio
drew back into the shadow of the wall."_Bien, senorita_," said Ricardo, stepping up to the child and
attempting to take her arm, "we will be held to account for the girl,
and we must not lose her._Caramba!_ For then would the good Padre
damn us forever!"Julio emerged swiftly from the shadow and
laid a restraining hand on Ricardo.The woman tore Carmen from his
grasp and thrust the girl behind herself."_Cierto_, friend Ricardo,
we are all responsible for her," she said quickly."But you are tired
and hungry--is it not so?Let me take you to the _cocina_, where you
will find roast pig and a bit of red rum.""_Caramba!_ my throat is like the ashes
of purgatory!""Come, then," said the woman, holding Carmen tightly by the hand and
leading the way down the steps to the kitchen below.Arriving there,
she lighted an oil lamp and hurriedly set out food and a large
_garrafon_ of Jamaica rum."There, _compadre_, is a part of your reward.And we will now wait
until Padre Diego arrives, is it not so?"While the men ate and drank voraciously, interpolating their actions
at frequent intervals with bits of vivid comment on their river trip,
the woman cast many anxious glances toward the steps leading to the
floor above.From time to time she replenished Ricardo's glass, and
urged him to drink.Physical exhaustion
and short rations while on the river had prepared him for just what
the woman most desired to accomplish, and as glass after glass of the
fiery liquor burned its way down his throat, she saw his scant wit
fading, until at last it deserted him completely, and he sank into a
drunken torpor.Then, motioning to Julio, who had consumed less of the
rum, she seized the senseless Ricardo by the feet, and together they
dragged him out into the _patio_ and threw him under a _platano_
tree."But, senorita--" began Julio in remonstrance, as thoughts of Diego's
wrath filtered through his befuddled brain."Not a word, _hombre_!""If you lay a
hand upon this child my knife shall find your heart!""How much did Padre Diego say he would give you?""Three _pesos oro_--and rations," replied the man thickly."Wait here, then, and I will bring you the money."Still retaining Carmen's hand, she mounted the steps, listening
cautiously for the tread of her master.Reaching the rotunda above,
she drew Carmen into the room from which she had emerged before, and,
bidding her conceal herself if Diego should arrive, took her wallet
and hastily descended to where the weaving Julio waited."There, _amigo_," she said hurriedly, handing him the money."Now do
you go--at once!And do not remain in Banco, or Padre Diego will
surely make you trouble.She
pointed to the door; and Julio, impressed with a sense of his danger,
lost no time in making his exit.Returning to Carmen, the woman seated herself and drew the girl to
her.she cried, trembling, as her eyes searched the
girl."I do not know, Anita dear," murmured the girl, nestling close to the
woman and twining an arm about her neck; "except that day before
yesterday the Alcalde put padre Rosendo into the jail--"

"Into the jail!"And then, when I was going to see him, Fernando ran
out of Don Mario's house and told me I must go in and see the Alcalde.Julio Gomez and this man Ricardo were there talking with Don Mario in
the _patio_.Then they threw a _ruana_ over me and carried me out
through the _patio_ and around by the old church to the Boque trail.When we got to the trail they made me walk with them to the Inanea
river, where they put me into a canoe.They paddled fast, down to the
Boque river; then to the Magdalena; and down here to Banco.They did
not stop at all, except when steamboats went by--oh, Anita, I never
saw a steamboat before!But Padre
Jose had often told me about them.And when the big boats passed us
they made me lie down in the canoe, and they put the _ruana_ over me
and told me if I made any noise they would throw me into the river.But I knew if I just kept still and knew--really _knew_--that God
would take care of me, why, He would.And, you see, He did, for He
brought me to you."A tired sigh escaped her lips as she laid her head
on the woman's shoulder."But--oh, _Santa Maria_!"moaned the woman, "you are not safe here!What can I do?--what can I do?""Well, Anita dear, you can know that God is here, can't you?I knew
that all the way down the river.And, oh, I am so glad to see you!Why, just think, it is eight years since you used to play with me!And
now we will go back to Simiti, will we not, Anita?""Pray to the Virgin to help us, child!You may have influence with
her--I have none, for my soul is lost!""Why, Anita dear, that is not true!You and I are both God's children,
and He is right here with us.All we have to do is to know it--just
really _know_ it.""But, tell me, quick--Diego may be here any moment--why did he send
Ricardo for you?""Anita dear, Padre Diego says I am his
child.""Yes--his daughter--that he is my father.But--is it really so,
Anita?""_Madre de Dios!_" cried the woman.He
saw you in Simiti when he was last there--and you are now a
beautiful--No, child, you are not his daughter!The wretch lies--he is
a sink of lies!"Why, no, Anita dear, he is not a beast--we must love him, for he is
God's child, too," said Carmen, patting the woman's wet cheek with her
soft hand."_Carita_, he
is Satan himself!"I don't mean that what you think you see is God's child, Anita dear;
but that what you think you see stands for God's child, and isn't
real.And if we know that, why, we will see the real child of God--the
real man--and not what you call a beast."Carmen
looked about the room."Oh, Anita," she exclaimed, "what a beautiful
place, and what beautiful things you have!"She rubbed the tile floor
with her bare foot."Why, Anita dear, it is just like the palaces
Padre Jose has told me about!"She walked around the room, touching
the various toilet articles on the dresser, passing her hands
carefully over the upholstered chairs, and uttering exclamations of
wonder and delight.The woman looked up with a wan smile."_Chiquita_, they are nothing.They are all cheap trinkets--nothing compared with what there is in
the big world beyond us.You poor dear, you have lived all your life
in miserable little Simiti, and you haven't the slightest idea of what
there is in the world!""But, Anita dear, Simiti is beautiful," the girl protested.You have seen only this poor room, and you think it wonderful.I have
been to Barranquilla and Cartagena with Padre Diego, and have seen
houses a thousand times more beautiful than this.And yet, even those
are nothing to what there is in the world outside."Carmen went to the bed and passed her hand over the white counterpane."Anita--why, is this--is this your--"

"Yes, _chiquita_, it is my bed.You have never seen a real bed, poor
little thing.""But--" the child's eyes were wide with wonder--"it is so soft--you
sink way into it--oh, so soft--like the heron's feathers!I didn't
sleep at all in the canoe--and I am so tired."cried the woman, springing up and clasping the
girl in her arms.When he returns, he may come
right up here!_Santa Maria_, help me!--what shall I do?""Anita--let me sleep in your bed--it is so soft--but--" looking down
dubiously at her muddy feet.The woman's face had set in grim determination.She went to the dresser and took out a small stiletto, which she
quickly concealed in the bosom of her dress."Get right in, just as you
are!I will take care of Diego, if he comes!_Santa Maria_, I will--"

"Anita dear," murmured the girl, sinking down between the white
sheets, "you and I will just _know_ that God is everywhere, and
that He will take care of us, and of Padre Diego too."With a sigh
of contentment the child closed her eyes."Anita dear," she
whispered softly, "wasn't He good to bring me right to you?And
to-morrow we will go back to Simiti--and to padre Rosendo--and Padre
Jose--and--and Cantar-las-horas--you haven't seen him for such a long
time--such a long--long--Anita dear, I--love--you--"

The child dropped asleep, just as a heavy step fell outside the door.Ana sprang up and extinguished the lamp, then went quickly out into
the rotunda.Padre Diego was standing on the top step, puffing and
weaving unsteadily.The woman hurried to him and passed an arm about
his waist.she exclaimed in a tone of feigned solicitation."I feared you
had met with an accident!My heart beats like the patter of rain!Why
do you stay out so late and cause me worry?"The bloated face of the man leered like a Jack-o'-lantern."Spiritual
retreat, my love--spiritual retreat," he muttered thickly."Imbibing
the spirits, you know."The woman gave him a look of inexpressible disgust."But you are home
safe, at any rate," she said in a fawning voice; "and my fear is
quieted.Come now, and I will help you into bed.she
cried, as he lurched toward the door of the room where Carmen lay; "in
your own room to-night!"He swayed to and fro before her, as she stood with her back against
the door."_Nombre de Dios_!"he muttered, "but you grow daily more unkind to
your good Padre!_Bien_, it is well that I have a fresh little
housekeeper coming!"He made again as if to enter the room.The woman
threw her arms about his neck."Padre dear," she appealed, "have you ceased to love your Anita?She
would spend this night alone; and can you not favor her this once?"he croaked in peevish suspicion, "but I think you have a
paramour in there._Bien_, I will go in and shrive his wicked soul!"cried the desperate woman, her hand
stealing to the weapon concealed in her dress."Pepito came this
evening with the case of _Oporto_ which you ordered long ago from
Spain.I put it in your study, for I knew you would want to sample it
the moment you returned."he cried, turning upon her, "why do you not tell me
important things as soon as I arrive?I marvel that you did not wait
until morning to break this piece of heavenly news!_Bien_, come to
the study, and you shall open a bottle for me.but my throat
is seared with Don Antonio's vile rum!My parched soul panteth for the
wine of the gods that flows from sunny Spain!_Caramba_, woman, give
yourself haste!"Suffering himself to be led by her, he staggered across the rotunda
and into the room where long before he had entertained for a brief
hour Don Jorge and the priest Jose.Ana quickly broke the neck of a
bottle of the newly arrived wine and gave him a generous measure.murmured the besotted priest, sinking into a
chair and sipping the beverage; "it is the nectar of Olympus--triple
distilled through tubes of sunlight and perfumed with sweet airs and
the smiles of voluptuous _houris_!Ah, Lord above, you are good to
your little Diego!Another sip, my lovely Ana--and bring me the
cigarettes.And come, fat lass, do you sit beside me and twine your
graceful arms about my neck, while your soft breath kisses my old
cheek!Ah, _Dios_, who would not be human!the good God may
keep His heaven, if He will but give me the earth!"Ana drew his head against her bosom and murmured hypocritical words of
endearment in his ear, while she kept his glass full.Diego babbled
like a child.He nodded; struggled to keep awake; and at length fell
asleep with his head on her shoulder.Then she arose, and, assured
that he would be long in his stupor, extinguished the light and
hurried to her own room.The woman bent over her with the
lighted candle and looked long and wistfully.she
prayed, "if you will but save her, you may do what you will with me!"Tears flowed freely down her cheeks as she turned to the door and
threw the bolt.Coming back to the bed, she again bent over the
sleeping girl._Dios mio_--and that beast, he has seen her, and he would--ah,
_Dios_!"Going again to the dresser, she took from a drawer a sandalwood
rosary.Then she returned to the bed and knelt beside the child."Blessed Virgin," she prayed, while her hot tears fell upon the beads,
"I am lost--lost!Ah, I have not told my beads for many years--I
cannot say them now!_Santa Virgen_, pray for me--pray for me--and if
I kill him to-morrow, tell the blessed Saviour that I did it for the
child!Ah, _Santa Virgen_, how beautiful she is--how pure--what
hair--she is from heaven--_Santa Virgen_, you will protect her?""_Madre de Dios_--she is so beautiful, so
pure--"

Carmen moved slightly, and the woman rose hastily from her knees."Anita dear," murmured the child, "Jesus waked Lazarus--out of
his--sleep.she murmured when Carmen again
slept, "I am too wicked to sleep with so pure an angel!--no, I can
not!She spread a light shawl upon the tile floor near the window and lay
down upon it, drawing a lace _mantilla_ over her face to protect it
from the mosquitoes."_Santa Virgen_", she murmured repeatedly, "pray
the blessed Saviour to protect her to-morrow--pray for her, _Madre de
Dios_--pray for her!"*       *       *       *       *

The piercing shriek of a steamboat whistle roused the woman just as
the first harbingers of dawn spread over the river a crimson flush
that turned it into a stream of blood.Ana bent
over her and left a kiss on her forehead.Then she stole out of the
room and into the study.Padre Diego lay sunk in his chair like a
monster toad.The woman threw him a look of utter loathing, and then
hastily descended into the _patio_.Ricardo lay under the _platano_
tree, sleeping heavily."Padre Diego sends
you this money, and bids you go.She held out a roll of _pesos_.The man, after much vigorous persuasion, got heavily to his feet."_Caramba, senorita_!""That last
_tragito_--it was a bit too much, no?But--_Bien_, I would see the
good Padre.But, senorita, do me
the great favor to ask the good Padre to see me one little moment.He fumbled in his wallet and drew
out an envelope.He--"

"_Caramba_!"ejaculated the man loudly, as his senses returned."But I
believe there is something wrong here!_Bien_, now I shall see the
Padre!He pushed the woman aside and entered
the house.Ana started after him, and seized his arm.A scuffle ensued, and
Ricardo's voice was loud and shrill as they reached the stairs."Ricardo--anything you ask--double the
amount, if you will go!Leave the house--I will tell the Padre--I will
give him the letter--"

"_Caramba_, but I will see him myself!"shouted the lightheaded
Ricardo."_Bien,
enamorada_, is this the paramour whom you hid in your room last night?_Caramba_, you might have chosen a handsomer one!"Ana sank down with a moan and buried her face in her hands.Diego
heavily descended the stairs."_Bien_, so it is you!"I do not know, Padre," cried the man excitedly."Senorita Ana, she
made me drunk last night.I brought the girl--I waited for you, but
the senorita--"

"_Caramba_, I understand!"Ana had risen and was making for the stairs.Diego sprang to her and
seized her by the wrist.With her free hand she drew the stiletto from
her bosom and raised it to strike.Ricardo saw the movement, and threw
himself upon her.cried Diego, as Ricardo felled the woman and wrenched the
weapon from her grasp."My pretty angel, you have the venom of a
serpent!did you think to deceive your doting Padre?But--_Dios nos guarde_!"Carmen, awakened by the noise, had left her bed, and now stood at the
head of the stairs, looking with dilated eyes at the strange scene
being enacted below.Ana lay on the ground, her eyes strained
toward the girl.Ricardo bent over her, awaiting his master's command.He knew now that she had forever lost her power over the priest.Diego
stood like a statue, his eyes riveted upon Carmen.The girl looked
down upon them from the floor above with an expression of wonder, yet
without fear.Diego was the first to find his voice.At last you come to your lonely padre!Wait for me, _hermosissima_!"screamed Ana in a
voice of horror.Ricardo clapped his hand heavily over her mouth.he panted, feasting his eyes upon her, while a thrill
passed through his coarse frame."_Madre de Dios_, but you have grown
beautiful!Don Mario was right--you are surely the most voluptuous
object in human form that has ever crossed my path._Bien_, the
blessed God is still good to his little Diego!"He started away with her, but was detained by the loud voice of
Ricardo."_Bien_, Padre, my pay!""_Cierto, hombre_!"But--a
father's joy--ah!_Bien_, come to me to-morrow--"

"_Na, Senor Padre_, but to-day--now!I have risked my life--and I have
a wife and babes!"_Caramba_, ugly beast, but I will consign you to hell!There are more convenient seasons than this for your
business!"And, still holding tightly to the girl's hand, he led her
into the study.The woman turned upon Ricardo with the fury of a tiger."This will cost your life, for you have
put into his dirty hands the soul of an angel, and he will damn it!If you had only taken the money I brought you--"

"Demon-tongue, I will take it now!"He snatched the roll of bills from
her hand and bolted through the door.With a low moan the woman sank
to the ground, while oblivion drew its sable veil across her mind.Reaching the study, Diego pushed Carmen into the room and then
followed, closing the door after him and throwing the iron bolt.Turning about, he stood with arms akimbo upon his bulging hips and
gazed long and admiringly at the girl as she waited in expectant
wonder before him.A smile of satisfaction and triumph slowly spread
over his coarse features.Then it faded, and his heavy jowls and deep
furrows formed into an expression, sinister and ominous, through which
lewdness, debauchery, and utter corruption looked out brazenly,
defiantly, into the fair, open countenance of the young girl before
him.A sense of weariness and dull pain then seemed to follow.He
shook his heavy head and passed a hand across his brow, as if to brush
aside the confusion left by the previous night's potations.he muttered, falling heavily into a chair, "but had
I known you were here, little rosebud, I should have tried to keep
sober."He reached out to grasp her; but she eluded him and went
quickly to the open window, where she stood looking down into the
street below.The morning sunlight, streaming into the room, engulfed
her in its golden flood and transmuted the child of earth into a
creature divinely radiant, despite the torn gown and stains of river
travel."_Bien, carisima_," the man wheedled in a small, caressing voice,
"where is your greeting to your glad padre?he muttered,
his eyes roving over her full figure, "but the Virgin herself was
never more lovely!Come, daughter," he purred, extending his arms;
"come to a father's heart that now, praise the Saints!shall ache no
more for its lost darling."The girl faced about and looked at him for a few moments.What her
glance conveyed, the man was utterly incapable of understanding.Then
she drew up a chair that stood near the window, and sinking into it,
buried her face in her hands."_Caramba_, my smile of heaven!chirped Diego,
affecting surprise."Is it thus you celebrate your homecoming?Or are
these, perchance, fitting tears of joy?_Bien_, your padre's doting
heart itself weeps that its years of loneliness are at last ended."He
held the sleeve of his gown to his eyes and sniffed affectedly."_Bien_, and what then?""I was just knowing," she answered slowly, "that I was not afraid--that
God was everywhere, even right here--and that He would not let any
harm come to me."and you ask Him to protect you from your adoring father!He again held
out his arms to her."I am not afraid--now," she answered softly."But--I do not think God
will let me come to you.If you were really my father, He would."The man's mouth gaped in astonishment.A fleeting sense of shame
swept through his festering mind.Then the lustful meanness of his
corrupted soul welled up anew, and he laughed brutally.The idea
was delightfully novel; the girl beautifully audacious; the situation
piquantly amusing.He would draw her out to his further enjoyment."So," he observed parenthetically, "I judge you are on quite familiar
terms with God, eh?"The joke was excellent, and he roared with mirth.he
commented, reaching over and uncorking with shaking hand the bottle
that stood on the table.Then, filling a glass, "Suppose you thank Him
for sending his little Diego this estimable wine and your own charming
self, eh?Whereat he guffawed loudly and
slapped his bulging sides.The girl had already bowed her head again in her hands.Diego's beady eyes devoured the beautiful creature before him."_Bien_, little Passion flower," he
interrupted, "if you have conveyed to Him my infinite gratitude,
perhaps He will now let you come to me, eh?""I have thanked
Him, Padre--for you and for me," she said; "for you, that you really
are His child, even if you don't know it; and for me that I know He
always hears me.That was what the good man Jesus said, you know, when
he waked Lazarus out of the death-sleep.And so I
kept thanking Him all the way down the river."Diego's eyes bulged as if they would pop from his head, and his mouth
fell open wide, but no sound issued therefrom.The girl went on
quietly:

"I was not afraid on the river, Padre.And I was not afraid to come in
here with you.I knew, just as the good man Jesus did at the tomb of
Lazarus, that God had heard me--He just couldn't be God if He hadn't,
you know.And then I remembered what the good man said about not
resisting evil; for, you know, if we resist evil we make it real--and
we never, _never_ can overcome anything real, can we?So I resisted
evil with good, just as Jesus told us to do.I just _knew_ that God
was everywhere, and that evil was unreal, and had no power at all.And
so the _bogas_ didn't hurt me coming down the river.And you--you will
not either, Padre."Then, very seriously:

"Padre, one reason why I was not afraid to come in here with you was
that I thought God might want to talk to you through me, and I could
help you.The man settled back in his chair and stared stupidly at her.His face
expressed utter consternation, confusion, and total lack of
comprehension.Once he muttered under his breath, "_Caramba_!she is
surely an _hada_!"Absorbed in her
mission, she went on earnestly:

"You know, Padre, we are all channels through which God talks to
people--just like the _asequia_ out there in the street through which
the water flows.We are all channels for divine love--so Padre Jose
says."The priest sat before her like a huge pig, his little eyes blinking
dully, and his great mouth still agape."We are never afraid of real things, Padre, you know; and so I
couldn't be afraid of the real 'you,' for that is a child of God.And
the other 'you' isn't real.But such thoughts are not really ours, you know, for they don't come
from God.But," she laughed softly, "when I saw you coming up the
steps after me this morning--well, lots of fear-thoughts came to
me--why, they just seemed to come pelting down on me like the rain.I turned right on them, just as I've
seen Cucumbra turn on a puppy that was nagging him, and I said, 'Here,
now, I know what you are; I know you don't come from God; and anything
that doesn't come from God isn't really anything at all!'And so they
stopped pelting me.The good man Jesus knew, didn't he?That's why he
said so often, 'Be not afraid.'"Her big eyes sparkled, and her
face glowed with celestial light.Diego raised a heavy arm and,
groping for the bottle, eagerly drained another glass of wine."You think that wine makes you happy, don't you, Padre?"she observed,
watching him gulp down the heavy liquor.It just
gives you what Padre Jose calls a false sense of happiness.And when
that false sense passes away--for everything unreal has just _got_ to
pass away--why, then you are more unhappy than you were before.he
ejaculated, "will you rein that runaway tongue!""No, Padre," she replied evenly, "for it is God who is talking to you.You ought to, for you are a priest.You ought to
know Him as well as the good man Jesus did.Padre, can you lay your
hands on the sick babies and cure them?"The man squirmed uncomfortably for a moment, and then broke into
another brutal laugh.but we find it easier
to raise new babies than to cure sick ones!do _hadas_ have such voluptuous bodies, such plump legs!_Madre de Dios_, girl, enough of your preaching!"No, Padre," she answered quietly, "I do not want to come to you.But
I want to talk to you--"

"_Dios y diablo_!with a Venus before
me do you think I yearn for a sermon?delay it, delay it--"

"Padre," she interrupted, "you do not see _me._ You are looking only
at your bad thoughts of me."His laugh resembled the snort of an animal."Yes, Padre--and they are _very_ bad thoughts, too--they don't come
from God, and you are _so_ foolish to let them use you the way you do.And you know you see around
you only the thoughts that you have been thinking.Why don't you think
good thoughts, and so see only good things?""Can it be
that I don't see a plump little witch before me, but only my bad
thoughts, eh?_Bien_, then," he
coaxed, "come to your poor, deluded padre and let him learn that you
are only a thing of thought, and not the most enchanting little piece
of flesh that ever caused a Saint to fall!"Her smile had fled, and in its place
sadness and pity were written large upon her wistful face."Come, my little bundle of thought," he coaxed, holding out his fat,
hairy arms."No, Padre," the girl answered firmly."_Na_, then, still afraid, eh?""No, Padre; to be afraid would mean that I didn't understand God."Then come to me and prove that you do understand Him, eh?"Are
you invoking curses on the bald pate of your desolate father?""No, Padre; I am thanking God all the time that He is here, and that
He will not let you hurt me."The man's lust-inflamed eyes narrowed and the expression on his evil
face became more sinister.he growled, "will you come
hither, or must I--"

"No."She shook her head slowly, and her heavy curls glistened in the
sunlight."No, Padre, God will not let me come to you."Panting and cursing softly, the man got slowly to his feet."_Madre de
Dios_!"he muttered; "then we will see if your God will let me come to
you!"Her lips moved rapidly, though no
sound came from them.They were forming the words of the psalmist, "In
God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto
me."It was a verse Jose had taught her long since, when his own heart
was bursting with apprehension.She turned quickly as if to
flee.He thrust out his hand and clutched her dress.The flimsy
calico, frayed and worn, tore its full length, and the gown fell to
the floor.Her white body
glistened in the clear sunlight like a marble statue._"Por el amor de Dios_!"ejaculated the priest, straightening up and
regarding her with dull, blinking eyes.Then, like a tiger pouncing
upon a fawn, he seized the unresisting girl in his arms and staggered
back to his chair.he exclaimed, holding her with one arm about her
waist, and with his free hand clumsily pouring another glass of wine.Bien_, pretty thought,
drink with me this thought of wine!"He laughed boisterously at his
crude wit, and forced the glass between her lips."I--am not afraid--I am not afraid," she whispered, drinking."It
cannot hurt me--nor can you.he panted, setting down the glass and mopping his hot
brow, as he settled back into the chair again."You--do--not--love--me, Padre!""You have--only a wrong thought--of me--of love--of everything!""_Bien_--but you love me, pretty creature, is it not so?"he mocked,
holding up her head and kissing her full on the mouth."I--I love the _real_ 'you'--for that is God's image," she murmured,
struggling to hold her face away from his fetid breath."But--I do
not--love the way that image is--is translated--in your human mind!"he threw himself back and gave noisy vent to his
risibility.For the moment the girl seemed to forget that she was in the fell
clutches of a demon incarnate.Her thought strayed back to little
Simiti, to Cucumbra, to Cantar-las-horas, to--ah, was _he_ searching
for her now?And would he come?--

"It was Padre Jose; he taught me," she whispered sadly.The curse of God blast him, the monkey-faced
_mozo!You have a new master
now to give you a few needed lessons, _senorita mia_, and--"

"Padre Diego!"her tense voice checked further expression of his low
thought.You have no power to
harm me, or to teach me anything!She gasped again as his clutch
tightened about her.He
roughly drew the girl up on his knees."To be sure He will protect
you, my _mariposa._ And He is using me as the channel, you see--just
as you said a few moments ago, eh?"His rude laugh again echoed
through the room."He is not--using you--at all!""Evil thoughts are--are
using you.And all--they can do--is to kill themselves--and you!"Is such a sad fate in store for me, my beautiful
_hada_?"He chuckled and reached out again for the bottle."Another
little thought of wine, my love.I must remember to tell Don Antonio of this!--_Maldita_!"Struggling to save its
contents, he relaxed his hold on Carmen.Like a flash she wormed her
supple body out under his arm, slid to the floor, and gained the
window.shrilled Diego, aflame with
wrath.when I lay these hands again on you--!"Struggling to his feet, he made for the girl.But at the first step
the light rug slid along the smooth tiles beneath his uncertain tread.He threw out an arm and sought to grasp the table.But as he did so,
his foot turned under him.With a
groan the heavy man sank to the floor.For a moment Carmen stood as if dazed.Then the
girl picked up her torn dress and approached him carefully."It was
his bad thoughts," she whispered; "he slipped on them; they threw him!I knew it--I just _knew_ it!"Passing to one side, she gained the door, threw back the bolt, and
hurried out into the rotunda.Crouched on the floor, the stiletto
clasped in her hand, sat Ana, her face drenched with tears, and her
chest heaving.When she saw the girl she sprang to her feet.I could not save you;
I could not break through the heavy door; but I can punish him!"She
burst into a flood of tears and started into the room.cried the girl, throwing herself into the woman's arms.He did not hurt me--God would not let him!she whispered in awed tones,
"did God strike him dead?""I don't know, Anita--but come!clinging to the woman's skirt;
"Anita dear, do not go in there!The woman's eyes were wild, her hair loose and disheveled.she cried, "but we will make sure that the beast is dead before we
go!And if we leave this blade in his heart, it may be a warning to
others of his kind!"Your
murder-thoughts will kill you if you do!Listen--it is a
steamboat whistle!Oh, Anita--if it is going up the river--we can take
it--"

Ana hesitated.He may--"

"Yes, Anita, yes; leave him with God!""Come away, Anita--"

"But where, child?"Why--why, my father would kill me!""No, Anita dear; he loves you; he prays for you; he wants you!It is right--it is just what God has planned, I know!Pin
my dress together, and then hurry!"Mechanically she descended the
stairs and left the house, her hand tightly clasped by Carmen.Dully
she suffered herself to be led hurriedly to the river.A boat,
up-bound, was just docking.The captain stood leaning over the rail
and shouting his commands.murmured the weeping woman, hurrying up the gang
plank with the child.She hastened past the astonished passengers to
the captain and drew him to one side."The child--" she gasped, "Rosendo Ariza's--of Simiti--leave her at
Badillo--they will take her over--"

"Wait, senora," interrupted the captain tenderly."Is it not time for
you to go home, too?"He laid a hand on her shoulder and looked down
into her streaming eyes.And, leading them
down the deck, he opened the door of a vacant cabin and bade them
enter."You can tell me your story when we are under way," he said,
smiling as he closed the door."_Bien_," he muttered, his brow
clouding as he strode off."I have been looking for this for some
time.But--the child--Ariza's--ah, the priest Diego!I think I
see--_Caramba_!A few minutes later the big boat, her two long funnels vomiting
torrents of smoke and sparks, thrust her huge wheel into the thick
waters and, swinging slowly out into mid-stream, turned her flat nose
toward the distant falls of Tequendama.In one of her aft cabins a
woman lay on a cot, weeping hysterically.Over her bent a girl, with a
face such as the masters have sought in vain.The tenderly whispered
words might have been the lingering echo of those voiced in the little
moonlit death-chamber of Cartagena long agone."Anita dear, He is with us, right here.And He says, 'Anita, come!'"CHAPTER 26


"But, Padre dear, why are you so surprised that Padre Diego did not
hurt me?I would have been much more surprised if he had.You are
always so astonished when evil doesn't happen--don't you ever look for
good?Why, I don't ever look for anything else!How could I when I
know that God is everywhere?""The sense of evil--it overwhelms
me at times, _carita_--"

"But, Padre dear, why don't you know right then that it is nothing?If
you did, it would fade away, and only good would overwhelm you."She
nestled closer to the man and clasped her arms more tightly about his
neck."Why, Padre," she resumed, "I was not a bit surprised when
Captain Julio came and told us we were near Bodega Central, and that
he could see you and Juan and Lazaro sitting on the steps of the
inn.""Yes, _chiquita_, we were resting for a moment.If a down-river boat
came by we were going to take it.If not, we expected to go in the
canoe.""Padre dear, what did you intend to do in Banco?""Don't speak of it, child--we--"

"Juan and Lazaro have knives."I?--_chiquita_--"

"Padre dear, God never fights with knives.Anita had a knife; but God
wouldn't let her use it.I don't
know what happened to Padre Diego, except that he fell over his wicked
thoughts.You know, Padre dear, somewhere in the Bible you read to me
that 'With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to
help us, and to fight our battles.'I thought of that when Padre Diego
had his arm around me and held me so tight that I could hardly
breathe.It was only an arm of flesh, after, all, and it couldn't hold
me.""_Bien_, Padre," interrupted Juan, coming up from the boat, "if we are
to reach Simiti to-night we must start at once.""_Bueno_, then let us set out," returned Jose, rising.A muffled sob
reached his ears.He turned to the woman huddled in the shadow of the
door."Come, Ana," he said cheerily; "to-night you will again be home.""No, Padre--I do not go with you.In an instant Carmen's arms were around her."When padre
Rosendo sees us, you and me, why--"

"_Carisima_!"The woman's tears flowed fast while she hugged the girl
to her bosom."No--no--he would drive me from his house!I will get work in the _posada_, perhaps.Or Captain Julio
will take me to Honda on his next trip, and get me a place--"

"Then we must ask him to get a place for us both," interrupted Carmen,
sitting calmly down beside her."And think, Anita, how sad padre
Rosendo will be when he sees the men come back without us!"cried the sorrowing
woman, rising."You don't know what it is--"

"Yes, I do, Anita," returned the girl quickly; "it is nothing--just
zero--and you can't drown it!If it would do any good we would both
jump into the river--that is, if God told us to--wouldn't we?But it
doesn't help any to die, you know, for then we would have it all to do
over again.""Ana," said Jose, laying a hand on the woman's shoulder, "you do not
understand her--neither do I, wholly.But if she tells you to go with
us to Simiti, why, I think I would go.He took her hand and led her, weeping, but no longer resisting, down
to the canoe.Carmen followed, dancing like an animated sunbeam."What
fun, oh, what fun!"she chirped, clapping her hands."And just as soon
as we get home we will go right up to the _carcel_ and let padre
Rosendo out!""_Na, chiquita_," said Jose, shaking his head mournfully; "we have no
power to do that.""Well, then, God has," returned the girl, nothing daunted.Juan pushed the heavily laden canoe from its mooring, and set its
direction toward Simiti.Silence drew over the little group, and the
hours dragged while the boat crept slowly along the margin of the
great river.The sun had passed its meridian when the little craft
turned into the _cano._ To Jose the change brought a most grateful
relief.For, though his long residence in Simiti had somewhat inured
him to the intense heat of this low region, he had not yet learned to
endure it with the careless indifference of the natives.Besides, his
mind was filled with vivid memories of the horrors of his first river
trip.And he knew that every future experience on the water would be
tinged by them.In the shaded _cano_ the sunlight, sifting through the interlocking
branches of ancient palms and _caobas_, mellowed and softened into a
veil of yellow radiance that flecked the little stream with splashes
of gold.Juan in the prow with the pole labored in silence.At times
he stopped just long enough to roll a huge cigar, and to feast his
bright eyes upon the fair girl whom he silently adored.Lazaro, as
_patron_, sat in the stern, saturnine and unimpassioned.The woman,
exhausted by the recent mental strain, dozed throughout the journey.Carmen alone seemed alive to her environment.Every foot of advance
unfolded to her new delights.She sang; she chirped; she mimicked the
parrots; she chattered at the excited monkeys.It was with difficulty
that Jose could restrain her when her sharp eyes caught the glint of
brilliant Passion flowers and orchids of gorgeous hue clinging to the
dripping trees.she exclaimed, "they are in us, you know.We see our thoughts of them--and lots of people wouldn't
see anything beautiful about them at all, just because their thoughts
are not beautiful.Padre, we see--what you said to me once--we see our
interpretations of God's ideas, don't we?That is what I told Padre
Diego.But--well, he will just _have_ to see some day, won't he, Padre
dear?But now let us talk in English; you know, I haven't spoken it
for such a long time."What a rare interpretation of the
mind divine was this child!But he wondered why one so pure and
beautiful should attract a mind so carnal as that of Diego.he mused, "it is again that law.Good always stirs up its
suppositional opposite.And the most abundant good and the greatest
purity stir up the most carnal elements of the human mind.The greater the degree of good, the greater the seeming
degree of evil aroused.The perfect Christ stirred the hatred of a
world.Carmen arouses Diego simply because of her purity.Yet she
knows that he can not harm her."His eyes met the girl's, and she answered his unspoken thought in the
tongue which she was fast adopting."We _have_ to love him, you know,
Padre dear."Oh, not the 'him' that
the human mind looks at, but the real 'him,' you know--the 'him' that
is God's image.And you know there just isn't any other 'him,' now is
there?"murmured Jose, "if I could but keep my thought as
straight as she does!""But, Padre dear, your thought _is_ straight.You know, God's thought
is the only thought there really is.Any other thought has the minus
sign, and so it is zero.If we will always think of the real Padre
Diego, and love that, why, the unreal one will fade away from our
thought.""Do you suppose, _chiquita_, that if we love him we will make him
repent?"The child pondered the question for a moment.Then:

"Padre, what did you tell me once about the word'repent'?""It comes from the Greek word '_metanoia_.'""Yes," she reflected; "but what did you say that--"

"Oh, yes, I told you it meant a complete and radical change of
thought."It was heaven to have this girl before him
and to drink in the naive expressions of her active mind."Padre dear, when John the baptiser said, 'Repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand,' did he mean to tell the people that they must have
a complete change of thought?""_Chiquita_," he answered, "I
have no doubt he meant just that.For you have taught me that there
can be no salvation without such a complete and radical change.""No," she said with quick emphasis; "for God is mind, you know.And
His thought is the only real thought there is or can be.The thoughts
of mortals are the opposites of His thoughts, and so they are
illusions, and, like all lies, must pass away.If people want to be
immortal, they must think as God thinks, for He is immortal.They must
stop thinking that there is any power but God.They must stop letting
in thoughts of sickness, of sin, of wickedness, and all those things
that in English you call 'discord.'God says in the Bible, 'As the
heavens are higher than the earth, so are my thoughts higher than your
thoughts.'And if we want to be
like Him we must think His thoughts."I see, _chiquita_--sometimes very clearly--and
then again I don't see," he said slowly.she insisted, getting up on her knees and facing him.And if you hold this thought always, why, it
will--it will be--"

"Externalized; is that what you are trying to say?"Jesus said, 'As a man thinketh in his heart, so is
he.'""But, Carmen--I-- What you say is doubtless true in essence--but I
think you have not grasped it all--there are so many gaps that your
simple little system of religion does not fill in--so many great
questions that you do not answer.I see, in part--and then, again, I
don't see at all.And when you were stolen away from Simiti I saw
nothing but the evil--and it nearly killed me!"The man had always been an
enigma to her.She could not understand a nature that soared into the
spiritual empyrean one moment, and in the next fell floundering into
the bottomless pit of materialism.The undulating curve which
marked the development of the Rincon mind was to her a thing
incomprehensible."Padre dear," she said at length, a little sadly."When you look at
the first chapter in the Bible and read there how God made everything,
and man in His image, in the image of Mind, you see, and are very
happy.But when you go on to the second chapter and read how the Lord
God--not God, but the _Lord_ God--made a man of dirt, and how this
dirt man listened to his false thoughts and fell, why, then you are
unhappy.Can't you see that
one is a story of the real creation; and the other is the human mind's
interpretation of the creation--an interpretation made according to
the way the human mind thinks the creating _ought_ to have been in
matter?And the second chapter shows how
far the human mind can go--it shows how limited it is.The human mind
couldn't get any farther than that--couldn't make a man out of
anything but dirt.And
so it made a creation of its own.It couldn't understand God; and so
it made a Lord God, just like itself.And if you see, can't you _stick_ to it and _live_ it, until all
the unreal passes away?""I will never cease to try,
_chiquita_," he said."But we were talking about loving Diego, weren't
we?Yes, you are right, we must try to love him, for the good Jesus
said we must love our enemies.""But, if we love everybody, then we haven't any enemies.You can't
love a real enemy--and so there aren't any real ones.We see in other
people only what is in our own thought.If we see evil as real, why,
then we will see bad men and women all around us, for we only look at
our thoughts.But, if we look only at God's thoughts--Padre dear, I
didn't see anything but God's thought when Padre Diego had me in his
arms.I knew it wasn't real, but was just the human way of looking at
things.And I knew that love was the great principle of everything,
and that it just couldn't fail, any more than the principle of algebra
could fail to solve my problems.Well," she concluded with a little
sigh, "it didn't.""Dear little girl, you must be patient, very patient, with your
blundering old Padre Jose.He is groping for the light--"

In an instant, throwing the canoe into imminent danger of upsetting,
the impulsive girl had hurled herself into his lap and clasped her
arms about his neck.Juan and Lazaro by a quick and skillful effort
kept the craft upright.she cried, "I didn't mean to say a word that would
make you unhappy--Padre dear, I love you so!Padre, look at your
little girl, and tell her that you love her!"he murmured, "I--I must
not--and--yet--_chiquita_--I adore you!"He buried his face in her
shoulder.Juan made a wry mouth as he looked at the girl in the priest's arms.Then he suggested that a separation would more evenly balance the
boat.Carmen laughed up at him, but slipped down into the keel and sat
with her head propped against Jose's knees."Padre dear," she said, looking up at him with twinkling eyes, "I
heard Lazaro say a little while before we started that he had lived
many years in Simiti, and that it had always been very quiet until you
came.""_Ay de mi!_" sighed Jose."I can readily believe that the whole world
was quiet until I entered it.""But, Padre, perhaps you had to come into it to shake it up.""_Chiquita_," he said, "if ever you go out into it, with
your radical views regarding God and man; and if the stupid old world
will give ear to you, there will be such a shaking up as it has never
experienced since--"

"Padre dear," she interrupted, "I am not going out into the world.I
shall stay in Simiti--with you."He looked down at her, tenderly, wistfully.And then, while her words
still echoed through his mind, a great sigh escaped him.Dusk had closed in upon them when the canoe emerged into the quiet
lake.Huge vampire bats, like demons incarnate, flouted their faces as
they paddled swiftly toward the distant town.Soft evening calls
drifted across the placid waters from the slumbering jungle.Carmen's
rich voice mingled with them; and Juan and Lazaro, catching the
inspiration, broke into a weird, uncanny boating song, such as is
heard only among these simple folk.As they neared the town the song
of the _bogas_ changed into a series of loud, yodelling halloos; and
when the canoe grated upon the shaly beach, Dona Maria and a score of
others were there to welcome the returned travelers.At the sight of Ana, a murmur ran through the crowd."It is Anita, madre dear," Carmen quickly announced, as she struggled
out of Dona Maria's arms and took the confused Ana by the hand.The light of recognition came into Dona Maria's eyes.Quietly, and
without demonstration, she went to the shrinking woman and, taking the
tear-stained face in her hands, impressed a kiss upon each cheek."_Bien_," she said in a low, tender voice, "we have waited long for
you, daughter.*       *       *       *       *

The glow of dawn had scarce begun to creep timidly across the arch of
heaven when Fernando knocked at the portal of Rosendo's house and
demanded the custody of Carmen."And now, Fernando," demanded the priest, "what new outrage is this?""_Na_, Padre, a thousand
pardons--but it is the order of the Alcalde, and I only obey.But--you
may knock me down," he added eagerly, "and then I can return to him
and say that I could not take the girl, even by force!"The honest
fellow, ashamed of his mission, hung his head.he cried, "what say the people of Simiti?"They would demand Rosendo's release, if
there were proof that the girl--"

"Good, then!"Yes, the guard informed him this morning.The Alcalde, you know,
permits no one to approach the prisoner.""And does he know that Ana is here?""The guard did not tell him, for fear of exciting the old man._Hombre!_ I think there is no one in town who would venture to tell
Rosendo that.""_Bien pues_, Fernando, I think the time has come!Go quietly back and
summon every one to a meeting in the town hall at once.Tell them--"

"_Bien_, Padre, I shall know what to tell them.But," anxiously, "Don
Mario has the power to--"

"And we have a greater power," quickly replied the priest, his thought
dwelling on Carmen.An hour later the town hall was a babel of clacking tongues.Men,
women and children hurried, chattering, to and fro, exchanging diverse
views and speculating eagerly on the probable outcome of the meeting.Jose stood before them, with Carmen's hand clasped tightly in his.Don
Mario, purple and trembling with rage, was perched upon a chair,
vainly trying to get the ear of the people.In the midst of the hubbub a hush fell suddenly over the concourse.All heads turned, and all eyes fastened upon Ana, as she entered the
room and moved timidly toward Jose.The people fell back to make a
passage for her.Her shoulders were bent, and her face was covered
with a black _mantilla_.Don Mario, as his glance fell upon her, again attempted to address the
multitude.A strong arm from behind
pushed him from the chair.His craven heart began to quake, and he
cast anxious glances toward the single exit.Gently removing the _mantilla_ from the face of the woman, Jose turned
her toward the people.he said in a loud, penetrating
voice, "behold the work of Diego!"He paused for the effect which he knew would be made upon this
impressionable people.Then, when the loud murmur had passed, he drew
Carmen out before him and, pointing to her, said dramatically, "And
shall we also throw this innocent child to the wolf?"Fists were shaken under the Alcalde's
nose, and imprecations were hurled at him from all sides.Don Mario
drew his soiled handkerchief and mopped his steaming brow.Then his
voice broke out in a shriek: "The soldiers--this day I shall summon
them--it is a riot!""_Caramba!_ He speaks truth!"_Caramba!_ Let Diego have his child!""_

"Who says it is not his?"Clasping Jose's arm to steady herself, she had turned to
confront the excited assembly.Then:

"The priest Diego had a child--a girl.Her name--it was--Carmen."_Caramba!_ girl, how know you that?""I know, because I--was--its--mother!"Pandemonium burst upon the room at the woman's words.Don Mario
started for the door, but found his way blocked.he shouted; "and this girl is one of them!""I have lived with him eight
years!I know from his own lips that I speak the truth!"We will write to the President at Bogota!"_Caramba!_ Such an Alcalde!""Let him send for the soldiers, if he wishes to die!"As a unit the fickle people streamed from the room and started for the
jail.Don Mario was borne along on the heaving tide.Jose and Carmen
followed; but Ana fell back and returned to the house of Rosendo.The guard at the jail, seeing the concourse approaching, threw down
his _machete_ and fled.Rosendo's eyes were big with speculation,
though his heart beat apprehensively.The people jammed into the small
hut until it swayed and threatened to collapse."The key to the lock--_Caramba_!Juan quickly produced a long iron bar, and with a few lusty efforts
sprung the stocks.A dozen hands lifted the cramped Rosendo out and
stood him upon his feet.Carmen squirmed through the crowd and threw
herself into his arms.Then, with shouts and gesticulations, a triumphal procession quickly
formed, and the bewildered and limping Rosendo was escorted down the
main street of the town and across the _plaza_ to his home.At the
door of the house Jose turned and, holding up a hand, bade the people
quietly disperse and leave the liberated man to enjoy undisturbed the
sacred reunion with his family.With a parting shout, the people
melted quickly away, and quiet soon reigned again over the ancient
town."_Bien_, Padre," said Rosendo, pausing before his door to clasp anew
the priest's hand, "you have not told me what has caused this.Was it
the little Carmen--"

He stopped short.Glancing in at the door, his eyes had fallen upon
Ana.To Jose, hours seemed suddenly compressed into that tense
moment.Slowly Rosendo entered the house and advanced to the shrinking woman.Terror spread over her face, and she clutched her throat as the big
man stalked toward her.Then, like a flash, Carmen darted in front of
her and faced Rosendo."It is Anita, padre dear," she said, looking up into his set face, and
clasping his hand in both of hers."_Bien_, outcast, is your lover with you, that I may strangle him,
too?"cried Carmen, putting both her hands against him.snarled the angry man, still addressing the cowering
woman."Did you tire of him, that you now sneak home?as Ana rose and stood before him, "you come here that your illegal
brat may be born!he shouted, raising his clenched
fist as if to strike her.Carmen turned swiftly and threw herself upon the woman.Looking over
her shoulder, she addressed the raging man:

"Padre Rosendo!He only lets you
have it, because He is good to you!Shame on you, for daring to drive
Anita away--your own little girl!"Her voice rose shrill, and her
words cut deep into the old man's embittered heart."Shame on you, padre Rosendo!""If
God were like you He would drive you from the house, too!Are you so
much better than the good Jesus that you can drive away a woman who
sins?Are you better than the good father who was
so glad to see his prodigal son?If God were to punish you for your
sins, would He even let you live?Did He not set you free this very
morning?And do you now thank Him by driving your little girl from her
own home?Do you know that it was Anita who made you free, and who
brought me here?And is this the way you
thank Him?Then you will lose us both, for we will not stay with
you!"Jose stepped up and took Rosendo's arm.Carmen turned about and
continued her scoriation:

"Padre Rosendo, if the good, pure God was willing to use Anita to save
me from Padre Diego and bring me back to you, are you so wicked and so
ungrateful that you throw His love back in His face?"_Caramba!_" cried Rosendo, tears bursting from his eyes."She has
fouled my name--it was a good name, though my parents were slaves--it
was a good name--and she blackened it--she--"

"Padre Rosendo, there are only two names that have never been
blackened!Your human name is nothing--it is zero--it counts for
foolishness with God!You yourself are making your name blacker now
than Anita ever did!She repents, and comes to her father; and he is
so much more wicked than she that he drives her out!--"

"Enough, Carmen, child!""Come, Rosendo; go into the
parish house!Then a smile lighted up her face, and she reached up
and took Rosendo's hand.Together they passed silently out and into
the priest's house.Ana sank to the floor, where she buried her face in her hands and wept
violently."Wait, Ana," said Jose, tenderly stroking the unhappy woman's hair.And you shall remain here, where you
belong."Then Jose, wondering, went quietly to the door of
his house and looked in.Rosendo sat at the table, with Carmen on his
knees."And, padre," the child was saying, "the good Jesus told the woman not
to sin any more; and she went away happy.Padre, God has told Anita
not to sin any more--and she has come to us to be happy.We are going
to make her so, aren't we?Padre Diego couldn't hurt me, you know, for
God wouldn't let him.And he hasn't hurt Anita--God wouldn't let him
keep her--wouldn't let her stay with him.And we
have got to be like Him--we _are_ like Him, really.But now we have
got to show it, to prove it, you know."Rosendo's head was bent over the girl.The
child went on with increased animation:

"And, padre dear, God sends us Anita's little baby for us to love and
protect.Oh, padre, if the little one is a boy, can't we call it
Jose?""Yes, _chiquita_," Jose heard the old man murmur brokenly."And--padre, if it is a girl--what shall we call it?""We--we will call it--Carmencita,"
he whispered."Can't you see, padre, that God sends us
Anita's baby so that Padre Diego shall not have it?And now let's go
and tell her so, right away!"Jose slipped quickly back and stood beside the woman when Carmen and
Rosendo entered the room.The old man went directly to his daughter,
and, taking her in his brawny arms, raised her from the floor and
strained her to his breast.Tears streamed down his swart cheeks, and
the words he would utter choked and hung in his throat."Padre," whispered the delighted child, "shall I tell her our names
for the baby?"Divine Love was there, and
its dazzling effulgence blinded him.In the quiet of his own chamber
he sought to understand the marvelous goodness of God to them that
serve Him.CHAPTER 27


The reversal of a life-current is not always effected suddenly, nor
amid the din of stirring events, nor yet in an environment that we
ourselves might choose as an appropriate setting.It comes in the
fullness of time, and amid such scenes as the human mind which
undergoes the transformation may see externalized within its own
consciousness by the working of the as yet dimly perceived laws of
thought.Perhaps some one, skilled in the discernment of mental laws and their
subtle, irresistible working, might have predicted the fate which
overtook the man Jose, the fulsome details of which are herein being
recounted.Perhaps such a one might say in retrospect that the
culmination of years of wrong thinking, of false beliefs closely
cherished, of attachment to fear, to doubt, and to wrong concepts of
God, had been externalized at length in eddying the man upon this far
verge of civilization, still clinging feebly to the tattered fragments
of a blasted life.But it would have been a skilled prognostician,
indeed, who could have foreseen the renewal of this wasted life in
that of the young girl, to whom during the past four years Jose de
Rincon had been transferring his own unrealized hopes and his vast
learning, but without the dross of inherited or attached beliefs, and
without taint of his native vacillation and indecision of mind.For what he had been striving to fit her, he knew not.But in a
vaguely outlined way he knew that he was being used as a tool to shape
in some degree the mental development of this strange girl.Nor,
indeed, as the years passed, did she continue to seem so strange to
him.On the contrary, he now thought it more marvelous by far that the
world, after nineteen centuries of Christianity, did not think and act
more as did this girl, whose religious instruction he knew to have
been garnered at the invisible hand of God.That she must some day
leave him, despite her present earnest protestations, he felt to be
inevitable.And the thought pierced his soul like a lance.But he
could not be certain that with maturity she would wish to remain
always in the primitive environment in which she had been nurtured.Nor could he, even if she were willing, immolate her upon the barb of
his own selfishness.As for himself, the years had but seemed to increase the conviction
that he could never leave the Church, despite his anomalous position
and despite his renewed life--unless, indeed, she herself cast him
forth.Each tenderly hopeful letter from his proud, doting mother only
added to this conviction by emphasizing the obstacles opposing such a
course.Her declining years were now spent among the mental pictures
which she hourly drew upon the canvas of her imagination, pictures in
which her beloved son, chastened and purified, had at length come into
the preferment which had always awaited loyal scions of the house of
Rincon.Hourly she saw the day draw nearer when he should be restored
to her yearning arms.Each dawn threw its first rays upon his
portrait, which hung where her waking eyes might open upon it.Each
night the shadow cast by the candle which always burned beneath it
seemed to her eager sight to crown that fair head with a bishop's
mitre--a cardinal's hat--aye, at times she even saw the triple crown
of the Vicar of Christ resting upon those raven locks.If her own pen did not always correctly delineate her towering hopes,
his astute uncle did not fail to fill in whatever hiatus remained.And
the pressure of filial devotion and pride of race at times completely
smothered within him the voice of Truth which Carmen continually
sounded, and made him resolve often that on the day when she should
leave him he would bury his head in the lap of Mother Church and
submit without further resistance to the sable veil of assumed
authority which he knew she would draw across his mind.Convincing as
were the proofs which had come to him of the existence of a great
demonstrable principle which the Christ had sought to make a dull
world recognize, nevertheless he had as yet failed to rise permanently
above the mesmerism of human belief, which whispered into his
straining ears that he must not strive to progress beyond his
understanding, lest, in the attempt to gain too rapidly, he lose all.To sink into the arms of Mother Church and await the orderly
revelation of Truth were less dangerous now than a precipitate
severance of all ties and a launching forth into strange seas with an
untried compass.True, they
reasoned, he had seemed to see the working of mental law in his own
restoration to health when he had first come to Simiti.He had seemed
to see Rosendo likewise restored.But these instances, after all,
might have been casual.That Carmen had had aught to do with them, no
one could positively affirm.True, he had seen her protected in
certain unmistakable ways.But--others were likewise protected, even
where there had been no thought of an immanent, sheltering God.True,
the incident of the epidemic in Simiti two years before had impressed
upon him the serious consequences of fear, and the blighting results
of false belief.But he could not hope
suddenly to empty his mentality of its content of human thought; nor
did wisdom advise the attempt.He had at first tried to rise too
rapidly.His frequent backsliding frightened and warned him.Thus, while the days sped by, did the priest's thought ebb and flow.As morn broke, and the gallant sun drove the cowardly shadows of night
across the hills, his own courage rose, and he saw in Carmen the pure
reflection of the Mind which was in Christ Jesus.As night fell, and
darkness slunk back again and held the field, so returned the legion
of fears and doubts that battled for his soul.Back and forth in the
arena of his consciousness strove the combatants, while he rushed
irresolutely to and fro, now bearing the banner of the powers of
light, now waving aloft, though with sinking heart, the black flag of
the carnal host.For a while after his arrival in Simiti he had seemed
to rise rapidly into the consciousness of good as all-in-all.But the
strain which had been constantly upon him had prevented the full
recognition of all that Carmen saw, and each rise was followed by a
fall that left him for long periods immersed in despair.Following the return of Carmen and the ripple of excitement which her
abduction had spread over the wonted calm of Simiti, the old town
settled back again into its accustomed lethargy, and Jose and the girl
resumed their interrupted work.From Ana it was learned that Diego had
not voiced the command of Wenceslas in demanding the girl; and when
this became known the people rose in a body to her support.Don Mario,
though he threatened loudly, knew in his heart he was beaten.He knew,
likewise, that any further hostile move on his part would result in a
demand by the people for his removal from office.He therefore retired
sulking to the seclusion of his _patio_, where he sat down patiently
to await the turn of events.Rosendo, his great heart softened toward his erring daughter, again
rejoiced in the reunion of his broken family circle.But his soul
burned within him as, day after day, he saw Ana move silently about
like a sorrow incarnate.At times, when perchance he would come upon
her huddled in a corner and weeping quietly, he would turn away,
cursing deeply and swearing fulsome vengeance upon the lecherous beast
who had wrought her ruin."Padre," he one day said to Jose, "I shall kill him--I know it.The
girl's suffering is breaking my heart.He is like an evil cloud
hanging always over my family.I hate him, as the devil
hates the light!And Jose offered
no remonstrance, for the case lay not in his hands.Carmen again entered upon her interrupted studies with ardent
enthusiasm.And her first demand was that she be allowed to plunge
into a searching study of the Bible."Padre," she exclaimed, "it is a
wonderful book!Why--do the people in the world know what a book this
is?For if they did, they would never be sick or unhappy again!"Here it is--the
whole thing!'Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man
his _thoughts_.'But--don't the people know what that means?""Well, _chiquita_, and what does it mean?""Why--the unrighteous man is the man who thinks wrong thoughts--thoughts
of power opposed to God--thoughts of sin, of sickness, of accidents,
and all sorts of evil things--beliefs that these things are real, and
that God made or caused them!""_Bien_, and you think the Bible speaks truth?"Why, it says right here that it is given
by inspiration!That means that the men or women who wrote it thought
God's thoughts!""No, but that those who wrote it were--well, were cleaner window-panes
than other people--that they were so clean that the light shone
through them better than it did through others.""And what do you think now about Jesus?""Why, as you once said, that he was the very cleanest window-pane of
all!"From that hour the Bible was the girl's constant companion.Daily she
pored over it, delighted, enraptured.Jose marveled at her immediate
spiritual grasp.Instead of the world's manner of looking upon it as
only a collection of beautiful promises and admonitions, she saw
within it the statement of a principle that offered itself as a mighty
tool with which to work out humanity's every-day problems here and
now.From the first she began to make out little lists of collated
scriptural verses, so arranging them that she could read in them a
complete expression of an idea of God.These she would bring to Jose
and, perching herself upon his lap, would expound them, to her own
great delight and the wonder of the man who listened."See, Padre," she said, holding up one of these lists, "it says that
'in that day' whatever we ask of him will be given to us.Well, 'that
day' means when we have washed our window-panes clean, and the light
shines through so clear that we can ask in His name.It means when we
have stopped saying that two and two are seven.""Which means," Jose interpolated, "asking in his character.""Yes," she replied, "for then we will be just like him.And then
whatever we ask 'believing' will be given to us, for believing'
will then be 'understanding,' will it not?When we know--really
_know_--that we have things, why--why, we have them, that's all!"She did not wait for his reply, but went on enthusiastically:

"You know, Padre, in order to be like him we have got to'seek first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness'--His right-thinking.Well,
Jesus said the kingdom of God was within us.Of course it is, for it
is all a question of right-thinking.When we think right, then our
right thoughts will be--what you said--"

"Externalized," he supplied.We will see them all around us, instead of seeing, as we do now,
a lot of jumbled-up thoughts of good and evil which we call people and
things.And then will be the time when
'God shall wipe away all tears.'It is, as you say in English, 'up to
us' to bring this about.It is not for God to do it at all.Don't you
see that He has already done His part?He has made everything, and
'behold it was very good.'Well, He doesn't have to do it all over
again, does He?But we have got to wash our windows clean and let
in the light that comes from Him.That light comes from Him all the
time, just as the beams come from the sun, without ever stopping.We
never have to ask the sun to shine, do we?And neither do we have to
ask God to be good to us, nor tell Him what we think He ought to do
for us.We only have to _know_ that He is good, to us and to
everything, all the time.""Yes, _chiquita_, we must be truly baptised.""That is what it means to be baptised, Padre--just washing our
window-panes so clean that the light will come in.""And that light, little one, is truth.It certainly is a new way of
looking at it, at least, _chiquita_.""But, Padre, it is the _only_ way," she persisted."_Bien_, I would not say that you were mistaken, Carmen.""No, Padre, for we can prove it.And, look here," she continued,
referring to her list."If the kingdom of heaven is within us, then
everything that comes to us in life comes from within, and not from
without.And so, things never happen, do they?"I see," he replied seriously, "that from the mouths of babes and
sucklings comes infinite wisdom.""Well, Padre dear, wisdom is God's light, and it comes through any one
who is clean.It doesn't make any difference how old or young that
person is."How can you say that, _chiquita_?""Why, Padre, is God old?""Well, the unreal 'we' is already zero.Didn't you yourself say that
the human, mortal man was a product of false thought, thought that was
the opposite of God's thought, and so no thought at all?Didn't you
say that such thought was illusion--the lie about God and what He has
made?Then isn't the human 'we' zero?""Well--but--_chiquita_, it is often hard for me to see anything but
this sort of 'we,'" returned the man dejectedly.she entreated, "why will you not try to look at something
else than the human man?Look at God's man, the image of infinite
mind.You have _got_ to do it, you know, some time.He
said that every man would have to overcome.That means turning away
from the thoughts that are externalized as sin and sickness and evil,
and looking only at God's thoughts--and, what is more, _sticking to
them_!""Yes," dubiously, "I suppose we must some time overcome every belief
in anything opposed to God.""Well, but need that make you unhappy?It is just because you still
cling to the belief that there is other power than God that you get so
discouraged and mixed up.Why, I would try
it even if a whole mountain fell on me!"And Jose could but clasp the earnest girl in his arms and vow that he
would try again as never before.*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, while Jose and his little student-teacher were delving into
the inexhaustible treasury of the Word; while the peaceful days came
into their lives and went out again almost unperceived, the priest
Diego left the bed upon which he had been stretched for many weeks,
and hobbled painfully about upon his scarcely mended ankle.While a
prisoner upon his couch his days had been filled with torture.Try as
he might, he could not beat down the vision which constantly rose
before him, that of the beautiful girl who had been all but his.He
cursed; he raved; he vowed the foulest vengeance.And then he cried
piteously, as he lay chained to his bed--cried for something that
seemed to take human shape in her.He protested that he loved her;
that he adored her; that without her he was but a blasted cedar.Only Don
Antonio was found low enough in thought to withstand the flow of foul
language which issued from the baffled Diego's thick lips while he
moved about in attendance upon the unhappy priest's needs.Then came from the acting-Bishop, Wenceslas, a mandate commissioning
Diego upon a religio-political mission to the interior city of
Medellin.The now recovered priest smiled grimly when he read it."Prepare yourself, _amigo_," he said, "for a work of the Lord.You accompany me as far as Badillo, where we
disembark for stinking Simiti.And, _amigo_, do you secure a
trustworthy companion.Meantime, my blessing
and absolution."Then he sat down and despatched a long letter to Don Mario.CHAPTER 28


"Rosendo," said Jose one morning shortly thereafter, as the old man
entered the parish house for a little chat, "a Decree has been issued
recently by the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office whereby,
instead of the cloth scapulary which you are wearing, a medal may be
substituted."_Cierto_, Padre--but," he hesitated, "is the new one just as--"

"To be sure, _amigo_.But I
have arranged it to wear about the neck."Rosendo knelt reverently and crossed himself while Jose hung the new
scapulary over his head."_Caramba!_" he
exclaimed, rising, "but I believe this one will keep off more devils
than that old cloth thing you made for me!"admonished Jose, repressing a smile, "did I not bless
that one before the altar?""_Cierto_, Padre, and I beg a thousand pardons.It was the blessing,
wasn't it?But this one," regarding it reverently,
"this one--"

"Oh, yes, this one," put in Jose, "carries the blessing of His Grace,
acting-Bishop Wenceslas.""And a Bishop is always very holy, is he not, Padre?""It makes no difference who he is, for the office makes him holy, is
it not so, Padre?""Oh, without doubt," returned Jose, his thought reverting to the
little Maria and the babe which for four years he had been supporting
in distant Cartagena."_Na_, Padre," remonstrated Rosendo, catching the insinuation, "we
must not speak ill of the Bishop, lest he be a Saint to-morrow!But,
Padre," he went on, changing the topic, "I came to tell you that Don
Luis has given me a contract to cut wood for him on the island._Hombre!_ I shall earn much money by its terms.I set
out to-morrow morning before daybreak."The man's words aroused within him a faint suspicion.Don Luis and the Alcalde were boon companions.Jose wondered if in
this commission he could see the gloved hand of Don Mario.But he gave
no hint of his thought to Rosendo.The next morning, long before sun-up, a mist lay thick over the
valley, so thick that Rosendo, as he made his way down to the lake,
scarce could distinguish the road ahead of him.The dry season had
passed, and the rains were now setting in.As he hurried along, the
old man mused dubiously on the contract which Don Luis had made with
him.To cut wood in the rainy season!--but, after all, that was no
concern of his.And yet--why had Padre Jose grown suddenly quiet when
he learned of the contract yesterday?His bare feet fell softly upon
the shales, and he proceeded more cautiously as he neared the water's
edge."_Hombre!_" he muttered, striving to penetrate the mist; "only a
_loco_ ventures out on the lake in such weather!"He reached the boat, and placed in it the rope and axe which he had
brought.Then, still troubled in thought, he sat down on the edge of
the canoe and dropped into a puzzled meditation.But fishermen do not go out on the lake in dense
fogs, he remembered.Then through the mist loomed the thick body of a man.Straining his
eyes, Rosendo recognized Padre Diego.With a bound the old man was upon his feet.His thick arm shot out
like a catapult; and his great fist, meeting Diego squarely upon the
temple, felled him like an ox.For a moment Rosendo stood over the prostrate priest, like a lion
above its prey.Then he reached into the canoe and drew out the axe.Holding it aloft, he stood an instant poised above the senseless man;
then with a mighty swing he whirled about and hurled it far out into
the lake.Incoherent
muttering issued from his trembling lips.He looked about in
bewilderment.He took the rope from
the boat and quickly bound Diego hand and foot.This done, he picked
up the unconscious priest and tossed him into the canoe as if he had
been a billet of wood.Jumping in after him, he hastily pushed off
from the shore and paddled vigorously in the direction of the island.Why he was doing this he had not the faintest idea.It was all the work of a few seconds; yet when his reason came again
Rosendo found himself far out in the thick fog, and his prisoner
moaning softly as consciousness slowly returned.The sense of
direction which these sons of the jungle possess is almost infallible,
and despite the watery cloud which enveloped him, the old man held his
course undeviatingly toward the distant isle, into the low, muddy
shore of which his boat at length forced its way under the impulse of
his great arms.The island, a low patch a few acres in extent, lay far out in the lake
like a splotch of green paint on a plate of glass.Its densely wooded
surface, rising soft and oozy only a few feet above the water, was
destitute of human habitation, but afforded a paradise for swarms of
crawling and flying creatures, which now scattered in alarm at the
approach of these early visitors coming so unexpectedly out of the
heavy fog.When the canoe grounded, Rosendo sprang out and pulled it well up into
the mud.Then he lifted the priest out and staggered into the thick
brush, where he threw his burden heavily upon the ground.Leaving his
prisoner for a moment, he seized his _machete_ and began to cut back
into the brush.Returning
to the now conscious Diego, he grasped the rope which bound him and
dragged him along the newly opened trail into a little clearing which
lay beyond.There he propped him up against a huge cedar.As he did
this, Diego's mouth opened wide and a piercing scream issued.The cry echoed dismally across the desolate island.In an instant
Rosendo was upon him, with his knife clutched in his fist."Repeat
that, _cayman_," he cried furiously, "and this finds your wicked
heart!"The craven Diego shook with fear; but he fell silent before the threat
of the desperate man into whose hands he had so unwittingly fallen.Rosendo stepped back and stood before his captive, regarding him
uncertainly.Diego's quick intuition did not fail to read the old
man's perplexity; and his own hope revived accordingly.It was a
pretty trick, this of Rosendo's--but, after all, he would not dare too
much.He even smiled unctuously
at his captor."_Bien, amigo_," he said at length, "is this your customary reception
to visitors in your village?_Caramba!_ but what will the good Bishop
say when he learns that you have thus mistreated his trusted agent?"His thought was confused, and
it moved slowly.In the cries of the disturbed birds he seemed now to
hear the warning voice of Carmen.In the watery vapor that rolled over
him he seemed to feel the touch of her soft, restraining hand."_Bien, compadre_," purred Diego, "would it not be well for you to
loosen this bit of thread, that we may make our way back to the
village?_Caramba!_ but it cuts sore--and I am soft, my friend, for I
have been ill.""What made you ill, _cayman_?"he
shouted, drawing nearer to the shrinking Diego and shaking a great
fist in his face._Caramba!_ I would that
your illness had carried you off and saved me the task of sending you
down to purgatory!""But--Rosendo--_caro amigo_,
let us reason together!Ah, _compadre_--loosen but a little this rope
which cuts into my tender skin as your bitter words do into my soul!""_Na_, vulture, but you will drown more quickly thus!"retorted
Rosendo, his huge frame trembling with agitation.But the man before him was an ignorant _peon_.It was not the first time that he had set his own wit against
another's brute strength.The ever-present memory of the girl
became more vivid."You see only your thoughts of me--and they are very bad!"Was he
seeing now only his own bad thoughts?But she had said they were
unreal.And this episode--_Hombre!_ he would not be afraid.His
thought was vastly more powerful than that of a simple _peon_!"But, _amigo_," he resumed gently, "if you had wished to drown me, why
did you bring me here?But--ah, well, I have long been prepared to go.I have been sadly misunderstood--disbelieved--persecuted!Ah, friend
Rosendo, if you could know what I do--but--_Bien_, it is of no
consequence now.Come, then, good fellow, despatch me quickly!Diego ceased talking and began to murmur
prayers.The wind was being taken from his
sails.Diego noted the effect, and resumed his speech.His voice was
low and soft, and at times great tears rolled down his cheeks."Rosendo, friend, I wish to go.And yet, I grieve that you must tarnish yours with my
blood.But," his eyes brightening and his tone becoming more
animated, "Rosendo, I will pray the blessed Virgin for you.When I am
with her in paradise I will ask her to beg the gentle Saviour to
forgive you._Bien_, good friend, we shall all be together in heaven
some day."He started his orisons again, and soon was praying like a
locomotive: "_Ora pro nobis!Santa Maria, ora pro nobis!_"

He stopped and sighed gently."Rosendo--I must say this before I die--I came to Simiti to see you.I
was approaching the boat to hold converse with you.But, you struck
me--there, _que importa_!And yet--it was about the gentle Ana, your
beautiful daughter--But, wait, Rosendo--God above!hear me through--"

Rosendo had started again toward him."Good friend, hear me first, then kill me quickly, for I much desire
to go to my home above!"The impression must be
made upon Rosendo at once, or all was lost.The wily priest knew the
_peon_ mind."_Bien_, good friend, you have misunderstood me.I--Rosendo--I--you will keep my secret, will you not?Bien, I have
left the Church.It was for good reasons that
God took me from the priesthood for other work in His field._Bien_,
the bonds of celibacy removed, behold!my first thought is for my
beautiful Ana.I would render
legitimate her unborn child.I would return to her the peace which she
lost when we became so deeply enamored of each other.Rosendo, I have
come to Simiti to lay my life before you--to yield it to the mother of
my child--to offer it in future service as a recompense for the
unhappiness which, the Virgin knows, I did not willingly bring upon
her, or you!"Rosendo's head was now in a whirl.His eyes protruded, and his mouth
was agape."But--the little Carmen--" he muttered.friend," said Diego sadly, shaking his head, while he quickly
grasped the cue, "I have ceased my endeavors to make you believe that
she is my child._Caramba!_ I can only leave it to the blessed Virgin
to restore her to me when we have both passed the portals of death.""_Caro amigo_," returned Diego gently, "in these last moments I see in
her the beautiful image of her blessed mother, who was taken from me
long before I met and loved your Ana.I await now the reunion which death alone can effect.Drown me not, I pray you,
but rather open an artery and let me fall gently asleep here beneath
this noble tree."A light came into Rosendo's troubled eyes.A cunning smile lurked
about his mouth."_Bien pues_, it shall be as you wish, vulture," he replied in a tone
which again struck terror to Diego's heart.He drew his knife and
approached the horrified priest."_Caramba!_" shrieked Diego, shrinking back against the tree."_Hombre!_ you do not intend--"

"Why not, vampire?"returned Rosendo, the sardonic smile spreading
across his grim features.But would
you go down to hell with murder on your soul?""_Cierto_, carrion!But you go down with a load of
murdered souls!""Rosendo--God!--it means hell for eternity to you!""To be sure, dog-meat," calmly replied Rosendo."But hell will be
heaven to me as I sit forever and hourly remind you of the suffering
Ana and the beautiful Carmen, whom you tried to ruin!Wild thoughts flashed through
his mind with lightning speed.A last
expedient came to him.He fixed his beady eyes upon Rosendo and
muttered: "Coward!you bind a sick man and stick him like a
pig!""We give a deer, a tapir, a jaguar, a chance for its life.But you--coward, you are afraid of a sick man!"_Caramba!_" he cried, "what
would you?"He leaped to the sitting man and at a stroke severed his
bonds."_Bien_, spew of the vampire!Diego extended his empty hands, palms up."_Caramba!_ take the knife!_Hombre!_ but I will kill you with my bare
hands!"He threw the long knife to Diego, who stooped and picked it
up.Stepping quickly back, holding the weapon firmly clenched before him,
the priest slowly circled Rosendo, as if looking for an opening.An
evil smile played constantly over his heavy face, and his little eyes
glittered like diamonds.Rosendo stood like a rock, his long arms
hanging at his side.Then, with a shrill, taunting laugh, Diego turned suddenly and
plunged into the newly-cut trail toward the lake.In an instant he was
lost in the fog.For a moment Rosendo stood dumb with amazement.Diego had reached the canoe, leaped
quickly in, and pushed off.He was
left a prisoner, without a boat, and with two miles of shrouded water
stretching between him and the town!He had been tricked, outwitted; and the
evil genius which for years had menaced his happiness was heading
straight toward the town, where his accomplice, Ricardo, awaited.What
would they do, now that he was out of the way?Great beads of water, distilled from his agony, burst through
his pores.The Juncal river lay off to the west, and at a much less
distance than Simiti.He might swim to it and secure a canoe at the
village.But--the lake was alive with crocodiles!Chagrin and apprehension overwhelmed him, and he burst into a flood of
bitter tears.He threw himself upon the ground, and tossed and moaned
in despair.Nature--God himself--seemed to conspire with Diego.He drew the new medal scapulary
around in front of him and kissed it, reverently crossing himself."_Santa Virgen_," he prayed, "help me--it is for the child!"Then,
taking between his teeth the knife which Diego had dropped, he rushed
into the water and struck out for the distant village of Juncal.*       *       *       *       *

Late that afternoon, while the tropical rain was descending in
torrents, Rosendo staggered into the parish house, where Carmen and
Jose were absorbed in their work.he gasped, "_Loado sea
Dios!_" as his eyes fell upon the girl.Then he sank to the floor in
utter exhaustion.cried Jose, bending over him in apprehension,
while Carmen stood lost in wonder.cried Rosendo, raising himself up on his elbow.cried both Jose and the girl in astonishment.Instinctively Jose's arm went about the child.Rosendo dragged himself
to a chair and sank limply into it."Then, Padre, he will come.Slowly the story came out, bit by bit."_Bien_, Padre," said Rosendo, concluding his dramatic and
disconnected recital, "I plowed through the water--_Caramba!_ I knew
not at what moment I should feel the jaws of a cayman seize upon me!_Bien_, I was then glad, for had I appeared in the village, all would
have said that I had murdered Diego!And so I struck out along the
trail that skirts the lake, and followed it around until I came here.And the rain--H_ombre_!it
beat me down--I fell again and again!And then, the fear that I was
too late--_Ah, Dios_!But she is safe--_Caramba_!"But, Rosendo," said Jose anxiously, "where can Diego--"

"He is here, _Caramba_!but I shall set out at
once and search every house!And he shall do well if he escape this
time!"But dusk was falling; and the old man, his strength sapped, listened
not unwillingly to Jose's better counsel.With the coming of night the
rain ceased, and the clouds rolled up and slipped down behind the
mountains, leaving the moon riding in splendor across the infinite
blue.Then Jose, leaving Carmen with Rosendo, walked to and fro
through the streets of the old town, listening and watching.He
wandered down to the lake.He climbed the hill where stood the second
church.He thought he caught the gleam of a light within the old
edifice.Their voices sounded
ghostly to his straining ears."But, friend Ricardo, he set out before dawn, and is not yet returned.I fear he has either abandoned us, or has walked into our good
Rosendo's jaws.""It is
more likely that he and Don Mario lie pickled in rum under the palms
of the Alcalde's _patio_!"He hurried down through the main street
and past the house of Don Mario.The door stood open, and he could see
the portly figure of the official outlined against the back wall.It
was evident that Diego was not there.He returned in perplexity to his
house and sat far into the night, musing on the strange incident.With the coming of the new day Rosendo appeared with fresh suggestions."_Bien_, Padre," he said, "there is nothing to do now but take the girl
and flee to the Boque river and to the _hacienda_ of Don Nicolas.""_Caramba!_" he muttered, "but this is a mystery!"Your canoe, Don Rosendo--as I started out
on the lake to fish I saw it, far in the distance.Did it break away from its
mooring, think you?"The latter replied quickly: "That is the most
reasonable supposition, Juan.But Rosendo is very grateful to you for
securing it again."When the lad had gone, Rosendo sat with bowed head, deeply perplexed."The pole and paddle, Padre, were left on the island.He--the boat--it must
have drifted long.Or--"

He stopped and scratched his head."Padre," he said, looking up
suddenly with an expression of awe upon his face, "do you suppose--do
you think that the Virgin--that she--made him fall from the canoe into
the lake--and that a _cayman_ ate him?_Ca-ram-ba!_"

Jose did not vouchsafe a reply.But his heart leaped with a great
hope.Rosendo, wrapped in profound meditation, wandered back to his
house, his head bent, and his hands clasped tightly behind his back.CHAPTER 29


The rainy season dragged its reeking length through the Simiti valley
with fearful deliberation.Jose thought that he should never again see
the sun.Great clouds of heavy vapor
rolled incessantly upward from the dripping jungle.The rain fell in
cloud-bursts, and the narrow streets of the old town ran like streams
in a freshet.Then, one day, Rosendo abruptly announced, "Padre, the rains are
breaking.And the little Carmen is fourteen
years old to-day."And
Carmen was no longer a child.Youth ripens quickly into maturity in
these tropic lands.The past year had sped like a meteor across an
evening sky, leaving a train of mingled light and darkness.Of Diego's
fate Jose had learned nothing.Ricardo and his companion had
disappeared without causing even a ripple of comment in Simiti.But he often eyed Jose and
Rosendo malignantly through the wooden grill at his window, and once
he ordered Fernando to stop Rosendo and ply him with many and pointed
questions.The old man was noncommittal, but he left a dark suspicion,
which was transmitted to the receptive mind of the Alcalde.Acting-Bishop Wenceslas likewise was growing apprehensive as the weeks
went by, and both Jose and Don Mario were the recipients of letters of
inquiry from him regarding the whereabouts of the priest Diego.In the
course of time came other letters from Cartagena, and at length an
order for a most scrutinizing search to be made for the Bishop's
confidential agent.Rosendo's oft-repeated testimony revealed nothing.The citizens of Simiti had not seen the man.The Alcalde had nothing
but his suspicions to offer.And these might have fallen harmlessly
upon the acting-Bishop's well occupied thought, had it not been for
the complicating influence of certain other events.The first of these
was the exhaustion of the gold which Jose and Carmen had discovered in
the old church.The other was the outbreak of the religio-political
revolution which Diego had predicted some six years before, and which,
in these latter days, Don Jorge, on his infrequent journeys through
Simiti had repeatedly announced as inevitable and imminent.Their
combined effect was such as to wrest Carmen away from Jose, and to set
in a new direction the currents of their lives.For some time past Jose had patched with growing anxiety the
shrinking of his gold supply, and had striven to lessen the monthly
contributions to Cartagena, meanwhile trying to know that the need
now looming daily larger before him would be met.He had not voiced
his apprehension to Carmen.But he and Rosendo had discussed the
situation long and earnestly, and had at length resolved that the
latter should again return to Guamoco to wash the Tigui sands.The old man sighed, but he uttered no protest.Yet each day Jose
thought he grew quieter.And each day, too, he seemed to become more
tender of his sad-faced daughter, Ana, and of the little grandson who
had come into his humble home only a few weeks before.He delayed his
preparations for specious reasons which Jose knew cost him much effort
to invent.He told his rosary often before the
church altar, and with tears in his eyes.And at night he would come
to Jose and beg him to read from the Bible and explain what he thought
the Saviour had really meant to convey to the humble fishermen of
Galilee.But at last the day arrived when he had
nothing to send to Cartagena beyond the mere pittance which the poor
members of his little parish contributed.Then came a letter from Wenceslas,
requesting an explanation.And then it was that Jose realized that in
his excess of zeal he had fallen into his own trap.For, having
established the custom of remitting a certain amount to the Bishop
each month, he must not resent now the implication of dishonesty when
the remittances fell off, or ceased altogether."_Bien_, Padre," said the latter slowly, "the time has come.In the days that followed, Jose could frame no satisfactory reply to
Wenceslas, and so the latter wrote to the Alcalde.Don Mario eagerly
seized the proffered opportunity to ingratiate himself into
ecclesiastical favor.Rosendo was again in the hills, he wrote, and
with supplies not purchased from him.Nor had he been given even a
hint of Rosendo's mission, whether it be to search again for La
Libertad, or not.There could be no doubt, he explained in great
detail, of Jose's connivance with Rosendo, and of his unauthorized
conduct in the matter of educating the girl, Carmen, who, he made no
doubt, was the daughter of Padre Diego--now, alas!probably cold in
death at the violent hands of the girl's foster-father, and with the
priest Jose's full approbation.The letter cost the portly Don Mario
many a day of arduous labor; but it brought its reward in another
inquiry from Cartagena, and this time a request for specific details
regarding Carmen.He dropped his customary well-oiled
manner, and carried his head with the air of a conqueror.His thick
lips became regnant, imperious.He treated his compatriots with
supercilious disdain.And to Jose he would scarce vouchsafe even a
cold nod as they passed in the street.Again he penned a long missive
to Cartagena, in which he dilated at wearisome length upon the
extraordinary beauty of the girl, as well as her unusual mental
qualities.He urged immediate action, and suggested that Carmen be
sent to the convent in Mompox.*       *       *       *       *

Wenceslas mused long over the Alcalde's letters.Then he sent for a young clerical agent of the See, who
was starting on a mission to Bogota, and requested that he stop off a
day at Badillo and go to Simiti to report on conditions in that
parish.Incidentally, also, to gather what data he might as to the
family of one Rosendo Ariza.In due course of time the agent made his report.The parish of Simiti
stood in need of a new _Cura_, he said.And the girl--he found no
words to describe or explain her.The Church had
need of prompt action, however, to secure her.To that end, he advised
her immediate removal to Cartagena.Aside from the girl, to whom he found his
thought reverting oftener than he could wish in that particular hour
of stress, his interest in Simiti did not extend beyond its
possibilities as a further contributor to the funds he was so greatly
needing for the furtherance of his complex political plans.As to the
Alcalde--here was a possibility of another sort.And at the same time warned
against precipitate action, lest he scatter Rosendo's family into
flight, and the graceful bird now dwelling in the rude nest escape the
sharp talons awaiting her."Send a message to Francisco, our Legate,
who is now in Bogota.Bid him on his return journey stop again at
Simiti.We require a full report on the character of the Alcalde of
that town."*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, Jose did not permit his mental torture to interfere
with Carmen's education.For six years now that had progressed
steadily.Wonderful, he thought--and yet not
wholly attributable to his peculiar mode of tutelage.For, after
all, his work had been little more than the holding of her mind
unwarped, that her instinctive sense of logic might reach those
truthful conclusions which it was bound to attain if guided safely
past the tortuous shifts of human speculation and undemonstrable
theory.To his great joy, these six years had confirmed a belief
which he had held ever since the troublous days of his youth,
namely, that, as a recent writer has said, "adolescent understanding
is along straight lines, and leaps where the adult can only
laboriously creep."There had been no awful hold of early teaching
to loosen and throw off; there were no old landmarks in her mind
to remove; no tenacious, clinging effect of early associations to
neutralize.And, perhaps most important of all, the child had seemed
to enter the world utterly devoid of fear, and with a congenital
faith, amounting to absolute knowledge, in the immanence of an
omnipotent God of love.This, added to her eagerness and mental
receptivity, had made his task one of constant rejoicing in the
realization of his most extravagant dreams for her.As a linguist, Carmen had become accomplished.And it was only a matter of practice to give her a similar
grasp of French, Italian, and German.As for other instruction,
such knowledge of the outside world as he had deemed wise to give her
in these six years had been seized upon with avidity and as
quickly assimilated.But he often speculated curiously--sometimes
dubiously--upon the great surprises in store for her should she ever
leave her native village.And yet, as often as such thought recurred
to him he would try to choke it back, to bar his mind against it, lest
the pull at his heartstrings snap them asunder.Often as he watched her expanding so rapidly into womanhood and
exhibiting such graces of manner, such amiability of disposition,
such selfless regard for others, combined with a physical beauty
such as he thought he had never before gazed upon, a great yearning
would clutch his soul, and a lump would rise in his throat.And
when, as was so often the case, her arms flew impulsively about his
neck and she whispered words of tender endearment in his ear, a
fierce determination would seize him, and he would clutch her to
himself with such vehemence as to make her gasp for breath.That she
might marry he knew to be a possibility.But the idea pierced his
soul as with a sword, and he thought that to see her in the arms of
another, even the man of her choice, must excite him to murder.One
day, shortly after her fourteenth birthday, she came to him and,
perching herself as was her wont upon his knees, and twining her arms
about his neck, said, with traces of embarrassment, "Padre dear,
Juan--he asked me to-day to marry him."She--marry a peon of Simiti!To
be sure, Juan had often reminded him of the request he had made for
her hand long ago.But Jose had not considered the likelihood of the
lad's taking his question directly to her.And the girl--

"And what did you reply?""Padre dear--I told him that--" She stopped abruptly."Well, _chiquita_; you told him--what?"He held her back from him and looked
squarely into her wide eyes."You told him, _chiquita_--"

"That--well, Padre dear, I told him that--that I might never marry.""And do you think, little girl, that you will always hold
to that resolution?""Yes, Padre, unless--"

"Well, _chiquita_, unless--"

"Unless you marry, too, Padre," she said, dropping her eyes.But--what has that to do with it,
girl?""Well--oh, Padre dear--can't you see?For then I would marry--" She
buried her face in his shoulder."Yes, _chiquita_," he said, dully wondering.It was the first expression of the kind that had ever come from her
lips.The Goddess of Fortune had
suddenly thrown her most precious jewel into his lap.Joy welled up in
flood tides from unknown depths within.Minutes passed, and the two sat very quiet."Padre," she whispered, "you don't say anything.And you will not always be a priest--not always," shaking her
beautiful curls with suggestive emphasis.The people called her an
_hada_.And then he knew that
she never moved except in response to a beckoning hand that still,
after all these years, remained invisible to him."_Chiquita_," he said in low response, "I fear--I fear that can never
be.And even if--ah, _chiquita_, I am so much older than you, little
girl--almost seventeen years!""You do not want to marry me, even if you could, Padre?"she queried,
looking wistfully into his eyes, while her own grew moist.he cried wildly, "you little
know--you little know!But--child, we must not talk of these things!"But, Padre dear," she pleaded, "just say that you _do_ love me that
way--just say it--your little girl wants to hear it."She, pleading that he would say he loved her!He silently prayed that his tortured soul might burst
and let his wasted life ebb into oblivion while his pent-up misery
poured out."I love you--love
you--love you!"Some day, Padre dear," she
murmured softly, "you will stop thinking that two and two are seven.She sank back in his arms and nestled close to him, as if she longed
to enter his empty heart and fill the great void with her measureless
love."And, Padre dear," she whispered, "your little girl will wait for
you--yes, she will wait."*       *       *       *       *

It was some days later that Rosendo, after returning almost empty
handed from the hills, came to Jose and said, "Padre, I have sold my
_hacienda_ to Don Luis.I need the money to purchase supplies and to
get the papers through for some denouncements which I have made in
Guamoco.I knew that Don Mario would put through no papers for me, and
so I have asked Lazaro to make the transaction and to deliver the
titles to me when the final papers arrive.I have a blank here to be
filled out with the name and description of a mineral property.I--what would be a good name for a mine, Padre?""Why do you ask that, Rosendo?""Because, Padre, I want a foreign name--one not known, here."There is a city, a great city, that I have often
heard about, up in the States," he said finally.He took up the little atlas which he had received long since with
other books from abroad."Look," he said, "it is called Chicago.Call
your property the Chicago mine, Rosendo.It is a name unknown down
here, and there can no confusion arise because of it.""_Caramba!_" Rosendo muttered, trying to twist his tongue around the
word, "it is certain that no one else will use that name in Guamoco!But that makes my title still more secure, no?""But, Rosendo," said Jose, when the full significance of the old man's
announcement had finally penetrated, "you have sold your _finca_!And
to acquire title to property that you can never sell or work!And the
sword that hangs above us may fall any day!""_Bien_, Padre, it is for her sake that I have done it.But, if the titles
should come from Cartagena during my absence--and, Padre, if anything
should happen to me--for the love of the Virgin do not let them out of
your hands!Yet Rosendo departed not on the morrow.He remained to mingle his
tears with those of the sorrowing Ana.For the woman, whose heart had
been lighter since the arrival of her babe, had come to the priest
that day to have the child christened.And so, before the sun might
fill the _plaza_ with its ardent midday heat, Rosendo and his family
repaired to the church.There before the altar Jose baptised the
little one and gave it his own name, thus triumphantly ushering the
pagan babe into the Christian Catholic world.The child cried at the
touch of the baptismal water."Now," commented Rosendo, "the devil has gone out of him, driven out
by the holy water."But, as Jose leaned over the babe and looked into its dark eyes, his
hand stopped, and his heart stood still.He raised his head and bent a
look of inquiry upon the mother.She returned the look with one that
mutely voiced a stifled fear and confirmed his own.He took a candle from the altar and passed it before the child's
eyes._Santa Virgen!_ Do not tell me--_Dios mio_!"The
mother's voice rose to a wail, as she snatched her babe away.Dona Maria stood mute; but Jose as
he looked at her divined her thought and read therein a full knowledge
of the awful fact that she had never voiced to the heart-broken
mother.Ana, what ails the
child?"Carmen crowded close to the weeping Ana."The babe, Rosendo," she said quietly, "was born--blind."CHAPTER 30


The "revolutionist" of Latin America is generally only the disgruntled
politician.His revolution is seldom more than a violent squabble
among greedy spoilsmen for control of the loose-jointed administration.But the great Mosquera Revolution which burst into flame in New
Granada in 1861 was fed with fuel of a different nature.It
demonstrated, if demonstration were necessary, that the Treaty of
Westphalia did not write _finis_ to the history of bloodshed in the
name of Christ; that it had but banked the fires of religious
animosity, until the furnace should be transferred from the Old World to
the New, where the breath of liberty would again fan them into
vigorous activity.The Mosquera War tore asunder Church and State; but left unhappy
Colombia prone and bleeding.It externalized a mighty protest of
enlightenment against Rome's dictates in temporal affairs.And, as has
before happened when that irresistible potentiality, the people, has
been stirred into action, the Church was disestablished, its property
confiscated, and its meddling, parasitical clergy disenfranchised.But then, too, as almost invariably occurs when the masses find that
they have parted with cherished prejudices and effete customs, and
have adopted ideas so radical as to lift them a degree higher in the
scale of progress, they wavered.The holy sacrament of marriage was
debased to a civil ceremony.Education was endangered by taking it out
of the hands of the pious clergy.Texts unauthorized by Holy Church
were being adopted.The alarm
spread, fanned by the watchful agents of Rome.And twenty years of incessant internecine warfare followed.And when
it was seen that Roman Catholicism was therein again declared to be
the national religion of the Republic of Colombia; when it was noted
that the clergy, obedient to a foreign master, were to be readmitted
to participation in government affairs; when it was understood that a
national press-censorship was to be established, dominated by Holy
Church; and when, in view of this, the great religio-political
opponent was seen laying down her weapons and extending her arms in
dubious benediction over the exhausted people, the masses yielded--and
there was great rejoicing on the banks of the Tiber over the
prodigal's return.When Wenceslas Ortiz was placed in temporary control of the See of
Cartagena he shrewdly urged the Church party to make at least a
pretense of disbanding as a political organization.The provinces
of Cundinamarca and Panama were again in a state of ferment.Congress, sitting in Bogota, had before it for consideration a
measure vesting in the President the power to interfere in certain
states or provinces whenever, in his opinion, the conservation of
public order necessitated such action.That this measure would be
passed, Wenceslas could not be sure.But that, once adopted, it would
precipitate the unhappy country again into a sanguinary war, he
thought he knew to a certainty.He had faced this same question six
years before, when a similar measure was before Congress.But then,
with a strong Church party, and believing the passage of the law to be
certain, he had yielded to the counsel of hot-headed leaders in
Cartagena, and approved the inauguration of hostilities.Congress dropped the measure like a
hot plate.The demands of the "revolutionists" were quickly met by the
federal government.The _causae belli_ evaporated.And Wenceslas
retired in chagrin to the solitude of his study, to bite his nails and
wonder dubiously if his party were strong enough to insure his
appointment to the See of Cartagena in the event of the then aged
occupant's demise.It was this hasty judgment of Wenceslas and his political associates
which had delayed further consideration of the objectionable measure
for six years.But the interim had seen his party enormously
strengthened, himself in control of the See, and his preparations
completed for turning the revolt, whenever it should come, to his own
great advantage.He had succeeded in holding the Church party aloof
from actual participation in politics during the present crisis.And
he was now keeping it in constant readiness to throw its tremendous
influence to whichever side should offer the greatest inducements.Congress dallied; and then prepared
to adjourn.Wenceslas received a code message from his agent in Bogota
that the measure would be laid on the table.At the same time came a
sharp <DW8> from New York.The funds had been provided to finance the
impending revolution.Had the Church party exaggerated its influence upon
Congress?"_Santa Virgen!_" he muttered, as he paced
angrily back and forth in his study.A
curse--"

He stopped still.In the midst of his imprecations an idea occurred to
him.He went to his _escritorio_ and drew out the Legate's recent
report."Ah," he mused, "that pig-headed Alcalde.Then he summoned his secretary and dictated telegrams to Bogota and
New York, and a long letter to the Alcalde of Simiti.These finished,
he called a young acolyte in waiting."Take a message to the Governor," he commanded."Say to His Excellency
that I shall, call upon him at three this afternoon, to discuss
matters of gravest import."Dismissing his secretary, he leaned back
in his chair and dropped into a profound revery.Shortly before the hour which he had set for conference with the
Departmental Governor, Wenceslas rose and went to his _escritorio_,
from which he took a paper-bound book._Bien_, I was correct in my surmise that I should some day have use
for this little volume.But--_Bien_, I think
it will do--I think it will do."A smile played over his handsome, imperious face.Then he snapped the
book shut and took up his hat.At the door he hesitated a moment, with
his hand on the knob."If the Alcalde were not such a fool, it would be impossible," he
mused."But--the combination--the isolation of Simiti--the imbecility
of Don Mario--the predicament of our little Jose--_Hombre_!it is a
rare situation, and it will work.It _must_ work--_cielo_!With the
pig-headed Alcalde seizing government arms to suppress the Church
party as represented by the foolish Jose, and with the President
sending federal troops to quell the disturbance, the anticlericals
will rise in a body throughout the country.Then Congress will hastily
pass the measure to support the President, the Church party will swing
into line with the Government--and the revolution will be on.Simiti
provides the setting and the fuel; I, the torch.I will cable again to
Ames when I leave the Governor."He swung the door open and went
briskly out.*       *       *       *       *

"Padre, I am crushed."He and Jose were sitting out in the
gathering dusk before the parish house on the evening of the day that
Ana's babe had been christened.The old man's head was sunk upon his
breast, and he rocked back and forth groaning aloud."We must be brave, Rosendo," returned Jose tenderly."We have gone
through much, you and I, since I came to Simiti.But--we have believed
it to be in a good cause."But, Padre, after it all, to have her babe come into the world blind!Padre, it is the last thing
that I can endure.I cannot return now to
Guamoco."Rosendo," said Jose, drawing his chair closer to the old man, and
laying a hand on his, "we have fought long and hard.But, if I mistake
not, the greatest struggle is yet to come.The greatest demand upon
your strength and mine is still to be made.""This: Juan returned from Bodega Central
this evening.He reports that several large boxes are there, consigned
to Don Mario, and bearing the government stamp.He found one of them
slightly broken, and he peered within.Jose went on:

"I did not intend to tell you this until morning.But it is right that
you should hear it now, that your courage may rise in the face of
danger.The federal government is sending arms to
Simiti to establish a base here at the outlet of the Guamoco region,
and well hidden from the Magdalena river.This town is to become a
military depot, unless I mistake the signs.And danger no longer
threatens, but is at our door."Rosendo rose slowly and drew himself up to his full
height."There is no question about it, Rosendo," replied Jose gravely."And I
have no reason to doubt the truth of Diego's prophecy, that this time
it will be one to be reckoned with.""Take her into the hills, Rosendo.Jose's thought was dwelling on his last talk with the girl.Again he
felt her soft arms about his neck, and her warm breath against his
cheek.He felt her kiss, and heard again her words, the sweetest, he
thought, that had ever echoed in mortal ears.And then he thought of
his mother, of his office, of the thousand obstacles that loomed huge
and insurmountable between him and Carmen.He passed a hand across his
brow and sighed heavily.I welcome, not
only the opportunity for service which this war may bring, but
likewise the hope of--death.If I could but know that she were
safe--"

"_Caramba_!Think you she would leave you here, Padre?Did
Rosendo's words convey aught to the priest that he did not already
know?"But--Rosendo, I shall not go," he returned bitterly."Then neither do we, Padre," replied Rosendo, sitting again."The
child, Carmen--she--Padre, she loves you with a love that is not of
the earth."*       *       *       *       *

Morning found the old man's conviction still unshaken.Jose sought the
quiet of his cottage to reflect.But his meditations were interrupted
by Carmen."Padre," she began, sparkling like a mountain rill in the sunlight as
she seated herself before him."Pepito--Anita's babe--he is not blind,
you know."Her head bobbed vigorously, as was her wont when she sought
to give emphasis to her dramatic statements.Jose smiled, and resigned himself to the inevitable."And, Padre, have you been thankful that he isn't?"You know, Padre Diego thought he couldn't see the reality.He
looked always at his bad thoughts.And so the not seeing, and the
seeing of only bad things, were both--externalized, and the babe came
to us without sight.That is, without what the human mind calls sight.And now," she went on excitedly, "you and I have just _got_ to know
that it isn't so!And I have
thanked Him all morning that this is so, and that you and I see it."Well--I suppose so," replied Jose abstractedly, his thought still
occupied with the danger that hung over the little town.There isn't any'suppose' about it!The eye is made _by_ the
sight.It thinks that sight
depends upon the optic nerve, and upon the fleshly eye.It is the sight that externalizes the'meaty' eye.You see, the
sight is within, not without.God is all-seeing; and so,
sight is eternal.But what he saw was the
beautiful, animated girl before him.And the thought that he must some
day be separated from her was eating his heart like a canker."Well, then," went on the girl, without waiting for his reply, "if a
mortal's mental concept of sight is poor, why, he will manifest poor
eyes.If the thought-concept were right, the manifestation would be
right."By that I
suppose you mean, _chiquita_, that the babe's thought, or concept, of
sight was all wrong, and so he came into the world blind.""Not at all, Padre," she quickly replied."The babe had nothing to do
with it, except to seem to manifest the wrong thoughts of its father,
or mother, or both.Or perhaps it manifests just simply bad thoughts,
without the bad thoughts belonging to anybody.For, you know, we none
of us really _have_ such thoughts.They are just a part of the one big lie about God.""Surely; the real babe is a child of God, and sees.""But the human babe doesn't see," he retorted."But," she replied, "what you call the human babe is only your mental
concept of the babe.And you see that mental concept as a blind one.See only God's child,
with perfect sight.And, Padre, after a while _you will see that babe
seeing things, just as we do_!she exclaimed, as he sat looking fixedly at
her."Don't you see that if you have the right thought about the babe,
and hold to it, and put out every thought that says it is blind, why,
your right thought will be externalized in a mental concept of a babe
that sees?Don't you know that that is exactly what Jesus did?He
didn't affect the real man at all.But he did change the mental
concepts which we call human beings.And we can do the same, if we
only know it, and follow him, and spiritualize our thought, as he did,
by putting out and keeping out every thought that we know does not
come from God, and that is, therefore, only a part of the lie about
Him.Here is a case where we have got to quit thinking that two and
two are seven.It is God's business to make our
concepts right.And we will see these,
right concepts if we will put out the wrong ones!"he queried lamely, wholly at a loss for any other answer."Well, Padre, I am not a bit afraid.I don't see a blind babe at all,
because there just can't be any."In other words, you don't intend to allow yourself to be deceived by
appearances?""Blindness is only an
appearance.But it doesn't appear to God, It appears only to the human
mind--which isn't any mind at all!And the appearance can be made to
disappear, if we know the truth and stick to it.For any appearance of
a human body is a mental concept, that's all.""Yes, a thing of _wrong_ thought.But all wrong thought is subject
to God's right thought.We've proved that, haven't we, lots of
times?Well, this wrong thought about a babe that is blind can be
changed--made to disappear--just as any lie can be made to disappear
when we know the truth.And so you and I are not going to be afraid,
are we?I told Anita this morning not to worry, but to just _know_
all the time that her babe did see, no matter what the appearance
was.And she smiled at me, Padre, she smiled.And I know that she
trusts, and is going to work with you and me."had he done aught of late but work against her
by his constant harboring of fears, of doubts, and his distrust of
spiritual power?"Padre," she resumed, "I want you to promise me that every day you
will thank God that the babe really sees.And that you will turn right
on every thought of blindness and know that it is a part of the lie
about God, and put it right out of your mind."But--child--if my mind tells me that the babe is blind, how can I--"

"I don't care what your mind tells you about the babe!You are to
listen to what God tells you, not your human mind!Does God tell you
that the babe is blind?"Why, no, _chiquita_, He--"

"Listen, Padre," she interrupted again, drawing closer to him."Is God
good, or bad, or both?""He is good, _chiquita_, all good.""And we have long since proved by actual reasoning and demonstration
that He is mind, and so infinite mind, no?""Well, an infinite mind has all power.And an infinite, all-powerful
mind that is all good could not possibly create anything bad, or sick,
or discordant--now could He?"But--the five physical
senses tell us differently."And yet, we know that the five physical senses _do not tell us
truth_!We know that when the human mind thinks it is receiving
reports about things through the five physical senses it is doing
nothing more than looking at its own thoughts."The thoughts of an infinite and good mind must be like that mind, all
good, no?Well, then, thoughts of discord, disease, blindness, and
death--do they come from the infinite, good mind?"Well, _chiquita mia_, that is just the sticking point.But the mighty question is, where _do_ those thoughts come
from?I am quite as ready as you to admit that discord, sin, evil,
death, and all the whole list of human ills and woes come from these
bad thoughts held in the human mind and so externalized.I believe
that the human man really sees, feels, hears, smells, and tastes these
thoughts--that the functioning of the physical senses is wholly
mental--takes place in mind, in thought only.That is, that the human
mind thinks it sees, feels, hears; but that the whole process is
mental, and that it is but regarding its thoughts, instead of actually
regarding and cognizing objects outside of itself."Isn't that just what I am
trying to tell you?""But--and here is the great obstacle--we differentiate between good
and bad thoughts.We agree that a fountain can not send forth sweet
and bitter waters at the same time.And so, good and bad thoughts do
not come from the infinite mind that we call God.Answer that, _chiquita_, and my problems will all be
solved."She looked at him in perplexity for some time.It seemed to her
that she never would understand him.But, with a little sigh of
resignation, she replied:

"Padre, you answered that question yourself, long ago.You worked it
all out three or four years ago.You let
the false testimony of the physical senses mesmerize you again.Instead of sticking to the thoughts that you knew to be good, and
holding to them, in spite of the pelting you got from the others, you
have looked first at the good, and then at the bad, and then believed
them all to be real, and all to be powerful.And so you got miserably
mixed up.And the result is that you don't know where you stand.Or, you think you don't; for that thought, too, is a bad one, and
has no power at all, excepting the power that you seem willing--and
glad--to give it."He knew in his heart that she was
right.He had not clung to the good, despite the roars of Satan.He
had not "resisted unto blood."Far from it; he had fallen, almost
invariably, at the first shower of the adversary's darts.And now, was
he not trying, desperately, to show her that Ana's babe was blind,
hopelessly so?Was he not fighting on evil's side, and vigorously,
though with shame suffusing his face, waving aloft the banner of
error?"The trouble with you, Padre," the girl resumed, after some moments of
reflection, "is that you--you see everything--well, you see everything
as a person, or a thing.""You mean that I always associate thought with personality?"But you have got to learn to deal with thoughts and ideas
by themselves, apart from any person or thing.You have got to learn
to deal with facts and their opposites entirely apart from places, or
things, or people.Now if I say that Life is eternal, I have stated a
mental thing.Its opposite, that is, the opposite of
Life, is death.That being so, Life is the reality, and death is the unreality.Very
well, what makes death seem real?It is just because the false thought
of death comes into the human mind, and is held there as a reality, as
something that has _got_ to happen.And that strong belief becomes
externalized in what mortals call death.Is there a
person in the whole world who doesn't think that some time he has got
to die?But now suppose every person held the belief that
death was an illusion, a part of the big lie about God, just as Jesus
said it was.Well, wouldn't we get rid of death in a hurry?And is there a person in the whole world who wouldn't say
that Anita's babe was blind?They would look at the human
thought of blindness, instead of God's real idea of sight, and so they
would make and keep the babe blind.Don't you understand me, Padre
dear?I know you do, for you really see as God sees!"Her eyes glistened, and her whole body seemed
to radiate the light of knowledge divine.Then she went hurriedly on:

"Padre, everything is mental.You know that, for you told me so, long
since.Well, that being so, we have got to face the truth that every
mental fact seems to have an opposite, or a lot of opposites, also
seemingly mental.Infinite mind is the
infinite fact.The so-called opposite of this infinite fact is the
human mind, the many so-called minds of mankind--_a kind of man._ But
everything is still mental.Now, an illusion, or a lie, does not
_really_ exist.If I tell you that two and two are seven, that lie
does not exist.Is it in what we call my mind, or yours?Even if
you say you believe it, that doesn't make it real.Nor does it show
that it has real existence in your mind.But--if you
hold it, and cling to it--allow it to stay with you and influence
you--why, Padre dear, everything in your whole life will be changed!"Let me take your pencil--and a piece of paper.Look now," drawing a
line down through the paper."On one side, Padre, is the infinite
mind, God, and all His thoughts and ideas, all good, perfect and
eternal.On the other side is the lie about it all.That is still
mental; but it is illusion, falsity.It includes all sin, all
sickness, all murder, all evil, accidents, loss, failure, bad
ambitions, and death.These are all parts of the big lie about
God--His unreal opposite.These are the so-called thoughts that come
to the human mind.The human
mind looks at them, tastes them, feels them, holds them; and then they
become its beliefs.After a while the human mind looks at nothing but
these beliefs.And, finally, it comes to
believe that God made them and sent them to His children.Isn't it
awful, Padre!And aren't you glad that you know about it?And aren't
you going to learn how to keep the good on one side of that line and
the illusion on the other?"It seemed to Jose a thing incredible that these words were coming from
a girl of fifteen.And yet he knew that at the same tender age he was
as deeply serious as she--but with this difference: he was then
tenaciously clinging to the thoughts that she was now utterly
repudiating as unreal and non-existent."Padre dear," the girl resumed, "everything is mental."Well," he replied reflectively, "at least our comprehension of it is
wholly mental.""Why--it is all inside--it is all in our thought!Padre, when Hernando
plays on that old pipe of his, where is the music?"But, _chiquita_, we don't seem to have it in our thought until we
seem to see him playing on the pipe, do we?""No, we don't," she replied.It is just because
the human mind believes that everything, even music, must come from
matter--must have a--"

"Must have a material origin?And men even believe that life itself has a material origin; and
so they have wasted centuries trying to find it in the body.They
don't seem to want to know that God is life.""Then, _chiquita_, you do not believe that matter is real?""There is no matter outside of us, or around us, Padre," she said in
reply."The human mind looks at its thoughts and seems to see them out
around it as things made of matter.But, after all, it only sees its
thoughts.""Then I suppose that the externalization of our thought in our
consciousness constitutes what we call space, does it not?""It must, Padre," she answered.Then:

"_Chiquita_, how do you know me?What do you see that you call'me'?""Why, Padre, I see you as God does--at least, I try always to see you
that way?""And that is the way Jesus always
saw people."But, does He see me as I see myself?""You do not see yourself, Padre," was her reply."You see only the
thoughts that you call yourself.Thoughts of mind and body and all
those things that go to form a human being.""Well--yes, I must agree with you there; for, though God certainly
knows me, He cannot know me as I think I know myself, sinful and
discordant.""He knows the real 'you,' Padre dear.He
knows that the unreal 'you,' the 'you' that you think you know, is
illusion.If He knew the human, mortal 'you' as real, He would have to
know evil."No, for the Bible says He is of eyes too pure to behold evil.""Well, Padre, why don't you try to be like Him?"But the girl needed not that he should answer her question.She knew
why he had failed, for "without faith it is impossible to please him:
for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
rewarder of them that diligently seek him."She knew that Jose's
struggle to overcome evil had been futile, because he had first
made evil real.She knew that the difficulty he had experienced in
keeping his thought straight was because he persisted in looking at
both the good and the evil.Lot's wife, in the Bible allegory, had
turned back to look at things material and had been transformed into
a pillar of salt.Jose had turned again and again to his materialistic
thoughts; and had been turned each time to salt tears.She knew that
he gave up readily, that he yielded easily to evil's strongest
tool, discouragement, and fell back into self-condemnation, whereby he
only rendered still more real to himself the evil which he was
striving to overcome.She knew that the only obstacle that he was
wrestling with in his upward progress was the universal belief in a
power other than God, good, which is so firmly fixed in the human
consciousness.But she likewise knew that this hindrance was but a
false conviction, and that it could and would be overcome."Padre," she reflected, looking up at him in great seriousness, "if a
lie had an origin, it would be true, wouldn't it?"He regarded her attentively, but without replying."But Jesus said that Satan was the father of lies.And Satan, since he
is the father of lies, must himself be a lie.You see, Padre, we can
go right back to the very first chapter in the Bible.First comes the
account of the real creation.Then comes the account as the human
mind looks at it.But that comes after the'mist' had gone up from
the ground, from dirt, from matter.That mist was
error, the opposite of Good.It was
the human mind and all human thought, the opposite of the infinite
Mind, God, and His thought.So every bit
of evil that you can possibly think of comes from the material,
physical senses.Evil is always a mist, hiding the good.The physical universe, the universe of matter, is the way the
human mind sees its thoughts of the spiritual universe that was
created by God.The human mind is just a bundle of these false
thoughts; and you yourself have said that the human consciousness
was a 'thought-activity, concerned with the activity of false
thought.'The human mind is the lie about the infinite mind.It
has no principle, and nothing to stand on.The minute you turn the
truth upon it, why, it vanishes.""Well, then, _chiquita_, why don't people turn the truth upon it
everywhere?""Because they are mesmerized by the error, Padre.They sit looking at
these false thoughts and believing them true.Padre, all disease, all
evil, comes from the false thought in the human mind.It is that
thought externalized in the human consciousness.And when the human
mind turns from them, and puts them out, and lets the true thoughts
in, why--why, _then we will raise the dead_!""But, _chiquita_, the human body--if it has died--"

"Padre," she interrupted, "the human body and human mind are one and
the same.The body that you think you see is
but your thought of a body, and _is in your so-called human mind_!""And so would you if you read your Bible
in the right way.Why--I had never seen a Bible until you gave me
yours.I didn't know what a book it was!And to think that it has been
in the world for thousands of years, and yet people still kill one
another, still get sick, and still die!"But, _chiquita_, people are too busy to devote time to demonstrating
the truths of the Bible," he offered."Why--busy making money--busy socially--busy having a good time--busy
accumulating things that--that they must go away and leave to somebody
else!""They are like the people Jesus spoke of, too
busy with things that are of no account to see the things that
are--that are--"

"That are priceless, _chiquita_--that are the most vital of all things
to sinful, suffering mankind," he supplied.These hours
with Carmen had become doubly precious to him of late.Perhaps he felt
a presentiment that the net about him and his loved ones was drawing
rapidly tighter.Perhaps he saw the hour swiftly approaching, even at
hand, when these moments of spiritual intercourse would be rudely
terminated.And perhaps he saw the clouds lowering ever darker above
them, and knew that in the blackness which was soon to fall the girl
would leave him and be swept out into the great world of human
thoughts and events, to meet, alone with her God, the fiercest
elements, the subtlest wiles, of the carnal mind.As for himself--he
was in the hands of that same God."_Chiquita_," he said, "you do not
find mistakes in the Bible?For, out in the big world where I came
from, there are many, very many, who say that it is a book of
inconsistencies, of gross inaccuracies, and that its statements are
directly opposed to the so-called natural sciences.They say that it
doesn't even relate historical events accurately.But, after all,
the Bible is just the record of the unfoldment in the human
consciousness of the concept of God.Why cavil at it when it
contains, as we must see, a revelation of the full formula for
salvation, which, as you say, is right-thinking."And it even tells us what to think about.Paul said, you
know, that we should think about whatsoever things are true, honest,
just, pure, lovely, and of good report.Well, he told us that there
was no law--not even any human law--against those things.And don't
you know, he wrote about bringing into captivity every thought to
Christ?"Just what you have been telling me, I guess, _chiquita_: that every
thought must be measured by the Christ-principle.And if it doesn't
conform to that standard, it must be rejected."He did die daily to evil,
to all evil thought--"

"And to the testimony of the physical senses, think you?"For, in proving God to be real, he had to prove the
reports of the five physical senses to be only human beliefs.""You are right, _chiquita_.He must have known that the corporeal
senses were the only source from which evil came.He must have known
that unless God testified in regard to things, any other testimony was
but carnal belief.This must be so, for God, being infinite mind, is
also infinite intelligence.He knows all things, and knows them
aright--not as the human mind thinks it knows them, twisted and
deformed, but right."And can't you
_stick_ to it, and prove it?""_Chiquita_," he answered, shaking his head again, his words still
voicing a lingering note of doubt, "it may be--the 'I' that I call
myself may be entirely human, unreal, mortal.I make no doubt it is,
for it seems filled to the brim with discordant thoughts.she cried, with a trace of exasperation."Empty yourself
of the wrong thoughts--shut the door against them--don't let them in
any more!Then when the
mortal part fades away, why, the good will be left.And it will be the
right 'you.'""But how shall I empty myself, and then fill myself again?"cried the girl, springing from her chair and stamping her
foot with each word to give it emphasis."It is love, love, love,
nothing but love!Forget yourself, and love everything and everybody,
the real things and the real bodies!Love God, and good, and good
thoughts!Turn from the bad and the unreal--forget it!Why--"

"Wait, _chiquita_," he interrupted."A great war is threatening our
country at this very minute.Shall I turn from it and let come what
may?"But you can know that war comes only from the
human mind; that it is bad thought externalized; and that God is
peace, and is infinitely greater than such bad thought; and He will
take care of you--if you will let Him!"By sitting back and folding my hands and
saying, Here am I, Lord, protect me--"

"Oh, Padre dear, you make me ashamed of your foolish thought--which
isn't your thought at all, but just thought that seems to be calling
itself 'you.'Jesus said, He that believeth on me, the works that I do
shall he do likewise.But that did not mean sitting back with folded
hands.It meant _understanding_ him; and knowing that there is no
power apart from the Christ-principle; and using that principle, using
it every moment, _hard_; and with it overcoming every thought that
doesn't come from God, every thought of the human mind, whether it is
called war, or sickness, or death!""Then evil can be thought away, _chiquita_?"He knew not why he
pursued her so relentlessly."No, Padre," she replied with a gentle patience that smote him.But it can be destroyed in the human mind.And when you have
overcome the habit of thinking the wrong way, evil will disappear.That is what Jesus tried to make the people
see."Yet he had not put it to the proof.He had gone
through life, worrying himself loose from one human belief, only to
become enslaved to another equally insidious.He knew that the cause
of whatever came to him was within his own mentality.And yet he knew,
likewise, that he would have to demonstrate this--that he would be
called upon to "prove" God.His faith without the works following was
dead.He felt that he did not really believe in power opposed to God;
and yet he did constantly yield to such belief.And such yielding was
the chief of sins.He knew that
when the Master had said, "Behold, I give you power over all the
enemy," he meant that the Christ-principle would overcome every false
claim of the human mentality, whether that claim be one of physical
condition or action, or a claim of environment and event.He knew that
all things were possible to God, and likewise to the one who
understood and faithfully applied the Christ-principle.Carmen
believed that good alone was real and present.She applied this
knowledge to every-day affairs.And in so doing she denied reality to
evil.He must turn upon the claims of evil to life and
intelligence.His false sense of righteousness _must_ give place to
the spiritual sense of God as immanent good.He knew that Carmen's
great love was an impervious armor, which turned aside the darts of
the evil one, the one lie.He knew that his reasoning from the premise
of mixed good and evil was false, and the results chaotic.And knowing
all this, he knew that he had touched the hem of the garment of the
Christ-understanding.There remained, then, the test of fire."Padre," said Carmen, going to him and putting her arms about his
neck, "you say that you think a great war is coming.Don't you remember what it says in the book of
Isaiah?'No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper, and
every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt
condemn.This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their
righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.'No weapon of evil can
touch you, if you understand God.Every tongue of the human mind that
rises to judge you, to sentence you, shall be condemned.You will
condemn it--you _must_!This is your heritage, given you by God.And
your righteousness, your right-thinking, must come from God.Then--"

"Yes, yes, _chiquita_," he said, drawing her to him."And now, Padre, you will promise me that you will know every day that
Anita's babe is not blind--that it sees, because God sees?""Yes, _chiquita_, I promise.""Padre dear," she murmured, nestling close to him, "I love you so
much, so much!"He answered not, except in the tightening of the arm that was about
her.CHAPTER 31


In the weeks that followed there were days when the very air seemed
pregnant with potential destruction, awaiting only the daring hand
that would render it kinetic.Jose dwelt in a state of incessant,
heart-shaking agitation.The sudden precipitation of the revolt six
years before had caught him wholly unprepared, unaware even of the
events which had led to it.In the intervening years, however, he had
had some opportunity, even in his isolation, to study political
conditions in that unhappy country, and to form some estimate of the
mental forces at work in both Church and State which, he knew, must
ultimately bring them again into conflict for supremacy.His knowledge
of the workings of the human mind convinced him that Diego's dire
prophecy had not been empty; that the Church, though ostensibly
assuming only spiritual leadership, would nevertheless rest not until
the question "Who shall be greatest?"even in the petty, sordid
affairs of mortals, should be answered, and answered--though by force
of arms--in her favor.And his estimate of the strength of the
opposing parties had led him to believe that the impending struggle
would drench the land in blood.As to the _role_ which Wenceslas would play, he could form no
satisfactory estimate.He knew him to be astute, wary, and the
shrewdest of politicians.He knew, likewise, that he was acting in
conjunction with powerful financial interests in both North America
and Europe.He knew him to be a man who would stop at no scruple,
hesitate at no dictate of conscience, yield to no moral or ethical
code; one who would play Rome against Wall Street, with his own
unfortunate country as the stake; one who would hurl the fairest sons
of Colombia at one another's throats to bulge his own coffers; and
then wring from the wailing widows their poor substance for Masses to
move their beloved dead through an imagined purgatory.But he could not know that, in casting about impatiently for an
immediate _causus belli_, Wenceslas had hit upon poor, isolated,
little Simiti as the point of ignition, and the pitting of its
struggling priest against Don Mario as the method of exciting the
necessary spark.He could not know that Wenceslas had represented
to the Departmental Governor in Cartagena that an obscure _Cura_ in
far-off Simiti, an exile from the Vatican, and the author of a
violent diatribe against papal authority, was the nucleus about
which anticlerical sentiment was crystallizing in the Department
of Bolivar.He did not know that the Governor had been induced by the
acting-Bishop's specious representations to send arms to Simiti, to
be followed by federal troops only when the crafty Wenceslas saw
that the time was ripe.He did not even suspect that Don Mario was
to be the puppet whom Wenceslas would sacrifice on the altar of
rapacity when he had finished with him, and that the simple-minded
Alcalde in his blind zeal to protect the Church would thereby
proclaim himself an enemy of both Church and State, and afford the
smiling Wenceslas the most fortuitous of opportunities to reveal the
Church's unexampled magnanimity by throwing her influence in with
that of the Government against their common enemy.His own intercourse with Wenceslas during the years of his exile in
Simiti had been wholly formal, and not altogether disagreeable as long
as the contributions of gold to the Bishop's leaking coffers
continued.He had received almost monthly communications from
Cartagena, relating to the Church at large, and, at infrequent
intervals, to the parish of Simiti.But he knew that Cartagena's
interest in Simiti was merely casual--nay, rather, financial--and he
strove to maintain it so, lest the stimulation of a deeper interest
thwart his own plans.His conflict with Diego in regard to Carmen had
seemed for the moment to evoke the Bishop's interference; and the
sudden and unaccountable disappearance of that priest had threatened
to expose both Jose and Carmen to the full scrutiny of Wenceslas.But,
fortunately, the insistence of those matters which were rapidly
culminating in a political outbreak left Wenceslas little time for
interference in affairs which did not pertain exclusively to the
momentous questions with which he was now concerned, and Jose and
Carmen were still left unmolested.It was only when, desperate lest
Congress adjourn without passing the measure which he knew would
precipitate the conflict, and when, well nigh panic-stricken lest his
collusion with Ames and his powerful clique of Wall Street become
known through the exasperation of the latter over the long delay, he
had resolved to pit Don Mario against Jose in distant Simiti, and, in
that unknown, isolated spot, where close investigation would never be
made, apply the torch to the waiting combustibles, that Jose saw the
danger which had always hung over him and the girl suddenly descending
upon them and threatening anew the separation which he had ever
regarded as inevitable, and yet which he had hoped against hope to
avoid.With the deposition of arms in Simiti, and the establishment of
federal authority in Don Mario, that always pompous official rose in
his own esteem and in the eyes of a few parasitical attaches to an
eminence never before dreamed of by the humble denizens of this
moss-encrusted town.From egotistical, Don Mario became insolent.From
sluggishness and torpidity of thought and action, he rose suddenly
into tremendous activity.He was more than once observed by Jose or
Rosendo emerging hastily from his door and button-holing some one of
the more influential citizens of the town and excitedly reading to him
excerpts from letters which he had just received from Cartagena.He
might be seen at any hour of the day in the little _patio_ back of his
store, busily engaged with certain of the men of the place in
examining papers and documents, talking volubly and with much excited
gesticulation and wild rolling of the eyes.A party seemed to be
crystallizing about him.His hitherto uncertain prestige appeared to
be soaring greatly.Men who before made slighting remarks about him,
or opposed his administrative acts, were now often seen in earnest
converse with him.His manner toward Jose and Rosendo became that of
utter contempt.He often refused to notice the priest as they passed
in the streets.It attained its climax when Rosendo
came to him one day to discuss the Alcalde's conduct and the change of
sentiment which seemed to be stealing rapidly over the hearts of the
people of Simiti."Padre," said the old man in perplexity, "I cannot say what it is, but
Don Mario has some scheme in hand, and--and I do not think it is for
our good.I cannot get anything out of those with whom he talks so
continually, but Lazaro tells me that--_Bien_, that he learns that Don
Mario suspects you of--of not belonging to the Church party."Don Mario's suspicions about him had been many and
varied, especially as La Libertad mine had not been discovered.He
said as much to Rosendo in reply; and as he did so, he thought the old
man's face took on a queer and unwonted expression."But, Padre," continued Rosendo at length, "they say that Don Mario
has word from the Bishop that you once wrote a book against the Holy
Father--"

"Good God!"The words burst from the priest's lips like the sudden
issuance of pent steam.Rosendo stared at him in bewilderment.it is what Lazaro tells me," replied the old man,
his own suspicion verging upon conviction.Jose's dark face became almost white, and his breath sobbed out in
gasps.A vague idea of the game Wenceslas was playing now stole
through his throbbing brain.That book, his Nemesis, his pursuing
Fate, had tracked him to this secluded corner of the earth, and in the
hands of the most unscrupulous politician of South America was being
used as a tool.But, precisely to what end, his wild thought did not
as yet disclose.Still, above the welter of it all, he saw clearly
that there must be no further delay on his part.Before he could
speak, however, Rosendo had resumed the conversation."Padre," he said, "had it occurred to you that you were watched, day
and night?"Don Mario's men keep you in sight during the day;
and at night there is always some one hovering near your house.You
could not escape now even if you would."Jose sank back in his chair limp and cold.His frenzied brain held but
one thought: he had delayed until too late--and the end was at hand!"Padre," said Rosendo earnestly, "tell me about that book.You have not brought Carmen up in the Church.But it was I who told
you not to--that her heart was her church, and it must not be
disturbed.But--is it true, as the people say, that you really belong
to the party that would destroy the Church?"While his heart burned within his breast,
he opened its portals and revealed to Rosendo all that lay within.Beginning with his boyhood, he drew his career out before the
wondering eyes of the old man down to the day when the culmination of
carnal ambition, false thought, perverted concepts of filial devotion
and sacredness of oath, of family honor and pride of race, had washed
him up against the dreary shores of Simiti.With no thought of
concealment, he exposed his ambition in regard to Carmen--even the
love for her that he knew must die of inanition--and ended by throwing
himself without reserve upon Rosendo's judgment.When the tense
recital was ended, Rosendo leaned over and clasped the priest's
trembling hand."I understand, Padre," he said gently."I am dull of wit, I know.And
you have often laughed at my superstitions and old family beliefs,
whether religious or otherwise.And I
shall die in the Church, and take my chances on the future, for I have
tried to live a good life.But--with a man like you--I understand.And
now, Padre, we have no time to be sorrowful.And both are
Carmen's, is it not so?Thanks be to the good Virgin," he muttered,
as he walked slowly away, "that Lazaro got those titles from Don Mario
to-day!"*       *       *       *       *

Nightfall brought an unexpected visitor in the person of Don Jorge,
who had returned from the remoter parts of the Guamoco region."_Bien_, and what news?"he called cheerily, as he strode into the
parish house, where Rosendo and Jose were in earnest conversation.Jose embraced him as a brother, while a great sense of relief stole
over him.Then he quickly made known to him the situation.He ceased his task of scraping the caked
mud from his bare limbs, and drew up a chair near Jose.But, _amigo_, lend
me a copy, for I doubt not it is most excellent reading, and will
serve to while away many a weary hour in the jungle."His eyes snapped
merrily, and he slapped Jose roundly upon the back when he finished
speaking."But," he continued more seriously, "things seem to be setting against
you, friend.However, let me but canvass the town to-morrow, and by
evening I can advise.And yet--and yet--I wonder why the Governor
sends arms here.Don Jorge needed not a full day to correctly estimate the situation in
Simiti.His bluff, hearty manner and genial good-nature constituted a
passport to every house, and by midday he had talked with nearly every
man in the _pueblo_.He called Jose and Rosendo for consultation
during the _siesta_."_Bien_," he said, when they were seated in the parish house, "Don
Mario without doubt descends from the very serpent that tempted our
mother Eve!He has become a person of considerable importance since
the Governor and Don Wenceslas strive with each other to rest their
authority and confidence in him.And, unless I mistake much, they have
him slated for important work.However that may be, the man already
has a large following.Moreover, he has them well poisoned against
you, _amigo_ Jose.They know more details about your book and your
life before coming to Simiti than do you._Bien_, you must counteract
the Alcalde's influence by a public statement.It must be to-night--in
the church!You will have to act quickly, for the old fox has you
picked for trouble!Diego's disappearance, you know; the girl, Carmen;
your rather foolish course here--it is all laid up against you,
friend, and you must meet it!"Don Jorge went out and summoned the town to a meeting
in the church that evening.Immediately Don Mario issued a mandate
forbidding a public gathering at a time of such stress.The people
began to assemble on the street corners and in front of their houses
to discuss the situation.Don Jorge was
everywhere, and none could talk so volubly nor gesticulate and
expectorate so vehemently as he.At sundown the people moved toward the _plaza_.Then the concourse
drifted slowly into the church.Don Jorge dragged Jose from the parish
house and up to the altar."You have got to divide them, Padre!""Your only hope now lies in the formation of your
own party to oppose the Alcalde!Talk to them as you never talked
before!Say all that you had stored up to say on Judgment Day!"Again, as Jose faced his little flock and saw them, bare of feet,
scantily clad in their simple cotton and calico, their faces set in
deep seriousness, the ludicrous side of the whole situation flashed
before him, and he almost laughed aloud at the spectacle which the
ancient, decayed town at that moment presented.These primitive
folk--they were but children, with all a child's simplicity of nature,
its petulance, its immaturity of view, and its sudden and unreasoning
acceptance of authority!He turned to the altar and took up a tall
brass crucifix.He held it out before him for a moment.Then he called
upon the Christ to witness to the truth of what he was about to say.Even Don Mario seemed to become calm
after that dramatic spectacle.He talked long and
earnestly.He knew not that such eloquence abode within him.His
declamation became more and more impassioned.He opened wide his heart
and called upon all present to look fearlessly within.Yes, he had
written the book in question.Yes, it had expressed his views at that time.The shadows were gathering
thick, and the smoking kerosene lamps battled vainly with the heavy
blackness.In a far corner of the room he saw Carmen and Ana.Rosendo
sat stolidly beside them.The sightless babe waved its tiny hands in
mute helplessness, while Dona Maria held it closely to her bosom.Carmen's last admonition sang in his ears.He must know--really
_know_--that the babe could see!His appeal to the people was not for himself.He cared not what
became of him.But Carmen--and now Ana and the blind babe--and the
calm, unimpassioned Dona Maria, the embodiment of all that was
greatest in feminine character--and Rosendo, waiting to lay down his
life for those he loved!And then, this people, soon, he felt, to be
shattered by the shock of war--ah, God above!what could he say that
might save them?If they could know, as Carmen did, if they could love
and trust as she did, would the hideous spectre of war ever stalk
among them?Could the world know, and love, and trust as did this fair
child, would it waste itself in useless wars, sink with famine and
pestilence, consume with the anguish of fear, and in the end bury its
blasted hopes in the dank, reeking tomb?The thought gave wings to his
voice, soul to his words.And, while the
holy hush remained upon the people, he descended the altar steps, his
frame still tremulous with the vehemence of his appeal, and went alone
to his house.CHAPTER 32


Dawn had scarcely reddened in the east when a number of men assembled
at Jose's door."You have turned the trick, _amigo_," said Don Jorge, rousing up from
his _petate_ on the floor beside the priest's bed."You have won over
a few of them, at least."Jose went out to meet the early callers."We come to say, Padre," announced Andres Arellano, the dignified
spokesman, "that we have confidence in your words of last night.We
suspect Don Mario, even though he has letters from the Bishop.We are
your men, and we would keep the war away from Simiti."There were five of them, strong of heart and brawny of arm."And there
will be more, Padre," added Andres, reading the priest's question in
his appraising glance.Thus was the town divided; and while many clung to the Alcalde, partly
through fear of offending the higher ecclesiastical authority, and
partly because of imagined benefits to be gained, others, and a goodly
number, assembled at Jose's side, and looked to him to lead them in
the crisis which all felt to be at hand.As the days passed, the
priest's following grew more numerous, until, after the lapse of a
week, the town stood fairly divided.Don Jorge announced his intention
of remaining in Simiti for the present.From the night of the meeting in the church excitement ran continuously
higher.Business was at length suspended; the fishermen forgot their
nets; and the limber tongues of the town gossips steadily increased
their clatter.Don Mario's store and _patio_ assumed the functions of
a departmental office.Daily he might be seen laboriously drafting
letters of incredible length and wearisome prolixity to acting-Bishop
Wenceslas; and nightly he was engaged in long colloquies and whispered
conferences with Don Luis and others of his followers and hangers-on.The government arms had been brought up from Bodega Central and stored
in an empty warehouse belonging to Don Felipe Alcozer to await further
disposition.But with the arrival of the arms, and of certain letters which Don
Mario received from Cartagena, the old town lost its calm of
centuries, not to recover it again for many a dreary day.By the time
its peace was finally restored, it had received a blow from which it
never recovered.And many a familiar face, too, had disappeared
forever from its narrow streets.Meanwhile, Jose and his followers anxiously awaited the turn of
events.It came at length, and in a manner not wholly unexpected.The
Alcalde in his voluminous correspondence with Wenceslas had not
failed to bring against Jose every charge which his unduly stimulated
brain could imagine.But in particular did he dwell upon the
priest's malign influence upon Carmen, whose physical beauty and
powers of mind were the marvel of Simiti.He hammered upon this
with an insistence that could not but at length again attract the
thought of the acting-Bishop, who wrote finally to Don Mario,
expressing the mildly couched opinion that, now that his attention
had been called again to the matter, Carmen should have the benefits
of the education and liberal training which a convent would afford.Don Mario's egotism soared to the sky.The great Bishop was actually
being advised by him!He would yet
remove to a larger town, perhaps Mompox, and, with the support of the
great ecclesiastic, stand for election to Congress!He would show the
Bishop what mettle he had in him.And first he would show
His Grace how a loyal servant could anticipate his master's wishes.He
summoned Fernando, and imperiously bade him bring the girl Carmen at
once.But Fernando returned, saying that Rosendo refused to give up the
child.But Fernando found it
impossible to execute the commission.Jose and Don Jorge stood with
Rosendo, and threatened to deal harshly with the constable should he
attempt to take Carmen by force.Fernando then sought to impress upon
the Alcalde the danger of arousing public opinion again over the
girl.Don Mario's wrath burst forth like an exploding bomb.He seized his
straw hat and his cane, the emblem of his office, and strode to the
house of Rosendo.His face grew more deeply purple as he went.At the
door of the house he encountered Jose and Don Jorge."Don Mario," began Jose, before the Alcalde could get his words
shaped, "it is useless.Be advised, Don Mario, for the consequences of
thoughtless action may be incalculable!"bellowed the irate official, "but, cow-face!do you know
that His Grace supports me?if you do not at once deliver to me your paramour--"

He got no further.Rosendo, who had been standing just within the
door, suddenly pushed Jose and Don Jorge aside and, stalking out, a
tower of flesh, confronted the raging Alcalde.For a moment he gazed
down into the pig-eyes of the man.Then, with a quick thrust of his
thick arm, he projected his huge fist squarely into Don Mario's
bloated face.Neither Jose nor Don Jorge, as they rushed in between Rosendo and his
fallen adversary, had any adequate idea of the consequences of the old
man's precipitate action.As they assisted the prostrate official to
his unsteady feet they knew not that to Rosendo, simple, peace-loving,
and great of heart, had fallen the lot to inaugurate hostilities in
the terrible anticlerical war which now for four dismal years was to
tear Colombia from end to end, and leave her prostrate and exhausted
at last, her sons decimated, her farms and industries ruined, and her
neck beneath the heavy heel of a military despot at Bogota, whose
pliant hand would still be guided by the astute brain of Rome.By the time the startled Alcalde had been set again upon his feet a
considerable concourse had gathered at the scene.Many stood in
wide-eyed horror at what had just occurred.The crowd rapidly grew, and in a few minutes the _plaza_
was full.Supporters of both sides declaimed and gesticulated
vehemently.In the heat of the arguments a blow was struck.The Alcalde, when he found his tongue, shrilly demanded the
arrest of Rosendo and his family, including the priest and Don Jorge.A dozen of his party rushed forward to execute the order.Rosendo had
slipped between Jose and Don Jorge and into his house.In a trice he
emerged with a great _machete_.His
eyes blazed like live coals, and his breath seemed to issue from his
dilating nostrils like clouds of steam.Don Jorge crept behind him and, gaining the house, collected
the terrified women and held them in readiness for flight.Juan,
Lazaro, and a number of others surrounded Jose and faced the angry
multitude.The strain was broken by the frenzied Alcalde, who rushed toward
Rosendo.The old man swung his enormous _machete_ with a swirl that,
had it met the official, would have clean decapitated him.But,
fortunately, one of the priest's supporters threw out his foot, and
the corpulent Alcalde fell heavily over it and bit the dust.The old man staggered with the shock and
gave way.Holding up both
hands high above his head, he sent out his voice clear and loud.The
blessed Virgin--"

"What know you of the blessed Virgin, priest of Satan?"shouted a
rough follower of the Alcalde.Julio Gomez stooped and took up a large piece of shale.He threw it
with all his force, just as the priest again strove to make his voice
heard above the din.The jagged
stone cut deeply, and the red blood spurted.Jose fell into the arms
of Lazaro and was dragged into the house.Then Rosendo, with a mad yell, plunged wildly into the crowd.A dozen
arms sought to hold him, but in vain.Julio saw the terrifying
apparition hurtling down upon him.He turned and fled, but not before
the great knife had caught him on its point as it swung down and
ripped a deep gash the full length of his naked back.Then the last vestige of reason fled from the mob, and chaos took the
reins.Back and forth through the _plaza_, in front of the church
where hung the image of the Prince of Peace, the maddened people
surged, fighting like demons, raining blows with clubs, fists, and
_machetes_, stabbing with their long, wicked knives, hurling sharp
stones, gouging, ripping, yelling, shrieking, calling upon Saints and
Virgin to curse their enemies and bless their blows.Over the heads of
them all towered the mighty frame of Rosendo.Back before his
murderous _machete_ fell the terrified combatants.His course among
them was that of a cannon ball.Dozens hung upon his arms, his
shoulders, or flung themselves about his great legs.His huge body,
slippery and reeking, was galvanized into energy incarnate.Sparks
seemed to flash from his eyes.Behind him, following in the swath which he cut, his supporters
crowded, fought and yelled.They cursed,
broke, and fled.Then Don Jorge, a man whose mortal strength was more
than common, threw himself upon the steaming, frenzied Rosendo and
stopped his mad progress.They are fleeing to the _bodega_
to get the rifles and ammunition!Come--_Dios arriba_!Cut, bruised, and dripping blood from a dozen wounds, Rosendo stood
for a moment blinking in confusion.A score lay on the ground about
him.Whether dead or wounded, he knew not, nor cared.The sight of Don
Mario's supporters in full flight fascinated him.It sounded like the gloating of an imp of Satan.Then the
force of Don Jorge's words smote him.cried Don Jorge, pulling him toward the
house.Those of the priest's other followers who were still whole
scattered wildly to their homes and barred their doors.There they
searched for knives, _machetes_, razors, any tool or instrument that
might be pressed into service as a weapon, and stood guard.One
frenzied fellow, the sole possessor of an antiquated shotgun,
projected the rusty arm from a hole in the wall of his mud hut and
blazed away down the deserted street indiscriminately and without
aim.Within the house Juan and Lazaro were supporting the dazed Jose, while
Dona Maria bathed and bound his wound.Carmen stood gazing upon the
scene in bewilderment.The precipitousness of the affair had taken her
breath away and driven all thought in mad rout from her mind.panted Don Jorge, "the church--it is the only place now
that is even fairly safe!Dona Maria, do you collect all the food in
the house!We know not how long we may be prisoners--"

"But--Don Jorge," interrupted Jose feebly, "they will attack us even
there!Let us flee--"

"Where, _amigo_?they would shoot us
down in cold blood!That
will hold some of them back, at any rate!And none of them, if they
get crazed with _anisado_!cried Rosendo, starting for the door, "but do you, Juan
and Lazaro, follow me with your _machetes_, and we will drive the
cowards from the _bodega_ and get the rifles ourselves!"By this time they have broken open the boxes
and loaded the guns.A shot--and it would be all over with you!But in
the church--you have a chance there!"Don Jorge seized his arm and dragged him out of the house and across
the deserted _plaza_.Juan and Lazaro helped Dona Maria gather what
food and water remained in the house; and together they hurried out
and over to the church.Swinging open the heavy wooden doors, they
entered and made them fast again.Then they sank upon the benches and
strove to realize their situation.Juan and Lazaro hurried to them and swung the wooden shutters.muttered Rosendo, seizing a bench and with one blow of
his _machete_ splitting it clean through, "these will make props to
hold them!"It was the work of but a few minutes to place benches across the thick
shutters and secure them with others placed diagonally against them
and let into the hard dirt floor.Then the little group huddled together and waited.Jose heard a sob
beside him, and a hand clutched his in the gloom.In
the excitement of the hour he had all but forgotten her.Through his
present confusion of thought a great fact loomed: as the girl clung to
him she was weeping!A low rumble drifted to them; a confusion of voices, growing louder;
and then a sharp report."They are coming, Padre," muttered Rosendo."And some one has tried
his rifle!"A moment later the ruck poured into the _plaza_ and made for Rosendo's
house.Don Mario, holding his cane aloft like a sword, was at their
head.Raging with disappointment at not finding the fugitives in the
house, they threw the furniture and kitchen utensils madly about,
punched great holes through the walls, and then rushed pellmell to the
parish house next door.A groan escaped Jose as he watched them
through a chink in the shutters.But as the howling mob streamed toward the parish house a wrinkled
old crone shrilled at them from across the way and pointed toward the
church."In there, _amigos_!"Shoot
them--they have hurt my Pedro!"Back like a huge wave the crowd flowed, and up against the church
doors.Don Mario, at the head of his valiant followers, held up his
hand for silence.Then, planting himself before the main doors of the
church, he loudly voiced his authority."In the name of the Government at Bogota!"he cried pompously, tapping
the doors with his light cane."Fernando," he
called, "run to my house and fetch the drum!"Despite the seriousness of their situation, Jose smiled at the
puppet-show being enacted without.The Alcalde reiterated his demands with truculent vanity."_Caramba!_ if I but had him in here alone!"Then, as no response came from within,
his anger began to soar."_Caramba!_" he cried, "but you defy the
law?"Angry mutterings rose from the crowd.A third intimated
that shooting them full of holes were better.This idea, once voiced,
spread like an infection.The childish people were eager to try the
rifles.The Alcalde threw himself heavily up against the doors."_Caramba!_"
he shrilled.Open!--or it will be the worse for you!"Jose decided that their silence should no longer exasperate the angry
man.He put his mouth to the crevice between the doors."Don Mario," he cried, "this is sacred ground!We may
settle this trouble amicably, if you will but listen to reason."The Alcalde jumped up and down in his towering wrath.he
screamed, "but I am the law--I am the Government!A curse upon you,
priest of Satan!"And if you attack us you attack the Church!"_Amigos!_ _Muchachos!_" he bawled, turning to
the mob, "we will batter down the doors!"Again and
again the mob hurled itself upon the thick doors.They bent, they
sagged, but they held.A torrent of
anathemas streamed from his thick lips.some one shouted, recovering a portion of his scant
wit."Aye--and the door of the _sacristia_!"Round the building streamed the crazed mob, without head, without
reason, lusting only for the lives of the frightened little band
huddled together in the gloom within.Ana bent sobbing over her tiny babe.Don Jorge and Rosendo remained
mute and grim.Jose knew that those two would cast a long reckoning
before they died.Juan and Lazaro went from door to window, steadying
the props and making sure that they were holding.The tough, hard,
tropical wood, though pierced in places by _comjejen_ ants, was
resisting.The sun was already high, and the _plaza_ had become a furnace.The
patience of the mob quickly evaporated in the ardent heat.Don Mario's
wits had gone completely.Revenge, mingled with insensate zeal to
manifest the authority which he believed his intercourse with
Wenceslas had greatly augmented, had driven all rationality from his
motives.Flaming anger had unseated his reason.Descending from the
platform on which stood the church, he blindly drew up his armed
followers and bade them fire upon the church doors.If Wenceslas, acting-Bishop by the grace of political machination,
could have witnessed the stirring drama then in progress in ancient
Simiti, he would have laughed aloud at the complete fulfillment of his
carefully wrought plans.The cunning of the shrewd, experienced
politician had never been more clearly manifested than in the carrying
out of the little program which he had set for the unwise Alcalde of
this almost unknown little town, whereby the hand of Congress should
be forced and the inevitable revolt inaugurated.Don Mario had seized
the government arms, the deposition of which in Simiti in his care had
constituted him more than ever the representative of federal
authority.But, in his wild zeal, he had fallen into the trap which
Wenceslas had carefully arranged for him, and now was engaged in a mad
attack upon the Church itself, upon ecclesiastical authority as vested
in the priest Jose.How could Wenceslas interpret this but as an
anticlerical uprising?And while
the soft-headed dupes and maniacal supporters of Don Mario were
hurling bullets into the thick doors of the old church in Simiti,
Wenceslas sat musing in his comfortable study in the cathedral of
Cartagena, waiting with what patience he could command for further
reports from Don Mario, whose last letter had informed him that the
arrest of the priest Jose and his unfortunate victim, Carmen, was only
a few hours off.When the first shots rang out, and the bullets ploughed into the hard
wood of the heavy doors, Jose's heart sank, and he gave himself up as
lost.Lazaro and Juan cowered upon the floor.Carmen crept close to
Jose, as he sat limply upon a bench, and put her arms about him."Padre dear," she whispered, "it isn't true--it isn't true!They don't
really want to kill us!The recriminating thought
flashed over him that he alone was the cause of this.He had
sacrificed them all--none but he was to blame.if he
could only offer himself to satiate the mob's lust, and save these
innocent ones!Lurid, condemnatory thoughts burned through his brain
like molten iron.Rosendo and
Don Jorge seized him as he was about to lift a prop."I am going out, friends--I shall give myself to them for you all.Let them have me, if they
will spare you!"But the firing had ceased, and Don Mario was approaching the door."Myself for the others, Don Mario!""But promise to spare them--but give me your word--and I
will yield myself to arrest!""It is not
you that the good Bishop wants, but the girl!I have his letters
demanding that I send her to him!If you will come out, you shall not
be hurt.Only, Rosendo must stand trial for the harm he did in the
fight this morning; and the girl must go to Cartagena.As for the rest
of you, you will be free."Juan and Lazaro," he said, "we will open a window quickly in
the rear of the church and let you out.It is not right that you
should die with us.And Don Jorge, too--"

"Stop there, _amigo!_" interrupted the latter in a voice as cold as
steel."My life has not the value of a white heron.Can I do better
than give it for a cause that I know to be right?Nay, man, I remain
with you.Let the lads go, if they will--"

Lazaro forced himself between Don Jorge and the priest."Padre," he
said quietly, "to you I owe what I am.The boy's eyes were fixed on
Carmen.He turned and gazed for a moment at a window, as if hesitating
between two decisions."Padre," he
said, though his voice trembled, "I, too, remain."The Alcalde received his answer with a burst of inarticulate rage.He
rushed back to his followers with his arms waving wildly._Compadres_, get
the poles and burst in the shutters._Caramba!_ it is the Government
they are defying!"A bullet pierced the wall and whizzed past Carmen.Jose seized the girl and drew her down under a bench.The startled
bats among the roof beams fluttered wildly about through the heavy
gloom.Frightened rats scurried around the altar.The rusty bell in
the tower cried out as if in protest against the sacrilege.Juan burst
into tears and crept beneath a bench."Padre," said Rosendo, "it is only a question of time when the doors
will fall._Bien_, let us place
the women back of the altar, while we men stand here at one side of
the doors, so that when they fall we may dash out and cut our way
through the crowd.If we throw ourselves suddenly upon them, we may
snatch away a rifle or two.Then Don Jorge and I, with the lads here,
may drive them back--perhaps beat them!But my first blow shall be for
Don Mario!I vow here that, if I escape this place, he shall not live
another hour!""Better so, Rosendo, than that they should take us alive.Do we leave her to fall into Don Mario's hands?"Rosendo's voice, low and cold, froze the marrow in the priest's bones."Padre, she will not fall into the Alcalde's hands."Rosendo, do you--"

A piercing cry checked him.Padre--!_" Lazaro had
collapsed upon the floor."Padre--I confess--pray for
me.He struggled to lay a hand upon his bleeding
breast."To the altar, _amigos_!"cried Don Jorge, ducking his head as a
bullet sang close to it.Seizing the expiring Lazaro, they hurriedly dragged him down the aisle
and took refuge back of the brick altar.The bullets, now piercing the
walls of the church with ease, whizzed about them.One struck the
pendant figure of the Christ, and it fell crashing to the floor.Rosendo stood in horror, as if he expected a miracle to follow this
act of sacrilege.prayed Jose, "only Thy hand can save us!""He will save us, Padre--He will!"cried Carmen, creeping closer to
him through the darkness."Padre," said Don Jorge hurriedly, "the Host--is it on the altar?""Then, when the doors fall, do you stand in front of the altar,
holding it aloft and calling on the people to stand back, lest the
hand of God strike them!""It is a chance--yes, a bare chance.They will
stop before it--or they will kill me!Carmen's
voice broke clear and piercing through the din.Jose struggled to free
himself from her."_Na_, Padre," interposed Rosendo, "it may be better so!Heavy poles and billets of wood had been
fetched, and blow after blow now fell upon every shutter and door.The
sharp spitting of the rifles tore the air, and bullets crashed through
the walls and windows.In the heavy shadows back of the altar Rosendo
and Don Jorge crouched over the sobbing women.Jose knew as he stretched out a hand through the darkness and touched
the cold face that the faithful spirit had fled.How soon his own
would follow he knew not, nor cared.Keeping close to the floor, he
crept out and around to the front of the altar.Reaching up, he
grasped the Sacred Host, and then stood upright, holding it out before
him.Carmen rose by his side and took his hand.Rosendo's hoarse whisper drifted across the silence like a wraith.He
crept out and along the floor, scarce daring to look up.Through the
darkness his straining eyes caught the outlines of the two figures
standing like statues before the altar."_Loado sea Dios!_" he cried, and his voice broke with a sob."But,
Padre, they have stopped--what has happened?"We are in the hands of God--"

"Padre--listen!"Carmen darted from the altar and ran to the door.All was quiet without, but for
an animated conversation between Don Mario and some strangers who had
evidently just arrived upon the scene.One of the latter was speaking
with the Alcalde in excellent Spanish.Another, evidently unacquainted
with the language, made frequent interruptions in the English tongue."Say, Reed," said the voice in English, "tell the parchment-faced old
buzzard that we appreciate the little comedy he has staged for us.Tell him it is bully-bueno, but he must not overdo it.We are plum
done up, and want a few days of rest.""What says the senor, _amigo_?"asked Don Mario, with his utmost
suavity and unction of manner."He says," returned the other in Spanish, "that he is delighted with
the firmness which you display in the administration of your office,
and that he trusts the bandits within the church may be speedily
executed."They are those who
defy the Government as represented by myself!"He straightened up and
threw out his chest with such an exhibition of importance that the
strangers with difficulty kept their faces straight.Carmen and Jose looked at each other in amazement during this
colloquy."Do all who speak English tell such
lies?"murmured the one addressed as Reed, directing himself to the
Alcalde, "how dared they!But, senor, my friend and I have come to
your beautiful city on business of the utmost importance, in which
you doubtless will share largely.I would suggest," looking with
amusement at the array of armed men about him, "that your prisoners
are in no immediate likelihood of escaping, and you might leave them
under close guard while we discuss our business.A--a--we hear
reports, senor, that there is likely to be trouble in the country, and
we are desirous of getting out as soon as possible."Cierto, senores!_" exclaimed Don Mario, bowing low.Turning to the gaping people, he selected
several to do guard duty, dismissed the others, and then bade the
strangers follow him to his house, which, he declared vehemently, was
theirs as long as they might honor him with their distinguished
presence.The sudden turn of events left the little group within the church in a
maze of bewilderment.They drew together in the center of the room and
talked in low whispers until the sun dropped behind the hills and
night drifted through the quiet streets.Late that evening came a
tapping at the rear door of the church, and a voice called softly to
the priest.Jose roused out of his gloomy revery and hastened to
answer it.I am on guard; but no one must know that I
talk with you.But--Padre, if you open the door and escape, I will not
see you.I am sorry, Padre, but it could not be helped.Don Mario has
us all frightened, for the Bishop--"

"True, _amigo_," returned Jose; "but the strangers who arrived this
afternoon--who are they, and whence?""Two _Americanos_, Padre, and miners.""Fernando--you would aid me?_Bien_, get word
to the stranger who speaks both English and Spanish.Bring him here,
secretly, and stand guard yourself while I talk with him.""Gladly, Padre," returned the penitent fellow, as he hastened quietly
away.An hour later Jose was again roused by Fernando tapping on the door.Fear not; only the _Americano_ will enter.Jose lifted the prop and swung the door open.Rosendo stood with
uplifted _machete_.Jose
quickly closed the door, and then addressed him in English.exclaimed the stranger in a mellow voice."I had no
idea I should find any one in this God-forsaken town who could speak
real United States!"Jose drew him into the _sacristia_.Neither man could see the other in
the dense blackness."Tell me, friend," began Jose, "who you are, and where you come
from.""Reed--Charles Reed--New York--mining engineer--down here to examine
the so-called mines of the Molino Company, now gasping its last while
awaiting our report.Arrived this afternoon from Badillo with my
partner, fellow named Harris.you certainly
were in a stew when we appeared!Even if we passed the guard, where would we
go?There are two women, a girl, and a babe with us.Should we gain the Boque or Guamoco trail, we would
be pursued and shot down.There is a chance here--none in flight!Reed," continued Jose earnestly, "will you get word from
me to the Bishop in Cartagena that our church has been attacked--that
its priest is besieged by the Alcalde, and his life in jeopardy?"Your _bogas_
have not returned to Badillo?""No, they are staying here for the big show.Execution of the
traitors, you know.""Then, friend, send them at dawn to Bodega Central.Let them take a
message to be sent by the telegraph from that place.Tell the
Bishop--"

"Sure!"I'll fix up a message
that will bring him by return boat!I've been talking with the
Honorable Alcalde and I've got his exact number.Say, he certainly is
the biggest damn--beg pardon; I mean, the biggest numbskull I have
ever run across--and that's saying considerable for a mining man!"said Jose, making no other reply to the man's words."Go
quickly--and use what influence you have with the Alcalde to save us.We have women here--and a young girl!"He found the American's hand
and led him out into the night.*       *       *       *       *

Wenceslas Ortiz stood before the Departmental Governor.His face was
deeply serious, and his demeanor expressed the utmost gravity.In his
hand he held a despatch.The Governor sat at his desk, nervously
fumbling a pen."_Bien, Senor_," said Wenceslas quietly, "do you act--or shall I take
it to His Excellency, the President?"The Governor moved uneasily in his chair."_Caramba!_" he blurted out.And yet, I cannot see but that the Alcalde
acted wholly within his rights!""Your Excellency, he seizes government arms--he attacks the church--he
attempts to destroy the life of its priest.Nominally acting for the
Government; at heart, anticlerical.Will the
Government clear itself now of the suspicion which this has aroused?""But the priest--did you not say only last week that he himself had
published a book violently anticlerical in tone?""Senor, we will not discuss the matter further," said Wenceslas,
moving toward the door."Your final decision--you will send troops to
Simiti, or no?"Wenceslas courteously bowed himself out.Once beyond the door, he
breathed a great sigh of relief."_Santa Virgen!_" he muttered, "but I
took a chance!Had he yielded and sent troops, all would have been
spoiled.He entered his carriage and was driven hurriedly to his _sanctum_.There he despatched a long message to the President of the Republic.He mused over it for the space of an hour."Your Excellency," it read, "the
Church supports the Administration."Late that evening a second message from Bogota was put into his hand.He tore it open and read, "The Hercules ordered to Simiti.""Ah," he sighed, sinking into his chair.A message to
the captain of the Hercules to bring me that girl!"*       *       *       *       *

"Well, old man, I've done all I could to stave off the blundering
idiot; but I guess you are in for it!The jig is up, I'm thinking!"Simiti again slept, while the American and Jose
in the _sacristia_ talked long and earnestly.Fernando kept guard at
the door."Your message went down the river two days ago," continued Reed.since then I've racked my dusty brain for topics to keep
the Alcalde occupied and forgetful of you.But I'm dryer than a desert
now; and he vows that to-morrow you and your friends will be dragged
out of this old shack by your necks, and then shot."The two days had been filled with exquisite torture for Jose.Only the
presence of Carmen restrained him from rushing out and ending it all.Every hour, every moment, she
knew only the immanence of her God; whereas he, obedient to the
undulating Rincon character-curve, expressed the mutability of his
faith in hourly alternations of optimism and black despair.After
periods of exalted hope, stimulated by the girl's sublime confidence,
there would come the inevitable backward rush of all the chilling
fear, despondency, and false thought which he had just expelled in
vain, and he would be left again floundering helplessly in the dismal
labyrinth of terrifying doubts.The quiet which enwrapped them during these days of imprisonment; the
gloom-shrouded church; the awed hush that lay upon them in the
presence of the dead Lazaro, stimulated the feeble and sensitive
spirit of the priest to an unwonted degree of introspection, and he
sat for hours gazing blankly into the ghastly emptiness of his past.He saw how at the first, when Carmen entered his life with the
stimulus of her buoyant faith, there had seemed to follow an emptying
of self, a quick clearing of his mentality, and a replacement of much
of the morbid thought, which clung limpet-like to his mentality, by
new and wonderfully illuminating ideas.For a while he had seemed to
be on the road to salvation; he felt that he had touched the robe of
the Christ, and heavenly virtue had entered into his being.But then the shadows began to gather once more.He did not cling to
the new truths and spiritual ideas tenaciously enough to work them out
in demonstration.He had proved shallow soil, whereon the seed had
fallen, only to be choked by the weeds which grew apace therein.The
troubles which clustered thick about him after his first few months in
Simiti had seemed to hamper his freer limbs, and check his upward
progress.Constant conflict with Diego, with Don Mario, and Wenceslas;
the pressure from his mother and his uncle, had kept him looking, now
at evil, now at good, giving life and power to each in turn, and
wrestling incessantly with the false concepts which his own mentality
kept ever alive.Worrying himself free from one set of human beliefs,
he fell again into the meshes of others.Though he thought he knew the
truth--though he saw it lived and demonstrated by Carmen--he had yet
been afraid to throw himself unreservedly upon his convictions.And so
he daily paid the dire penalty which error failed not to exact.But Carmen, the object of by far the greater part of all his anxious
thought, had moved as if in response to a beckoning hand that remained
invisible to him.And each
day, too, she had seemed to draw farther away from him, as she
rose steadily out of the limited encompassment in which they
dwelt.Not by conscious design did she appear to separate from him,
but inevitably, because of his own narrow capacity for true
spiritual intercourse with such a soul as hers.He shared her
ideals; he had sought in his way to attain them; he had striven,
too, to comprehend her spirit, which in his heart he knew to be a
bright reflection of the infinite Spirit which is God.But as the
years passed he had found his efforts to be like her more and more
clumsy and blundering, and his responses to her spiritual demands less
and less vigorous.At times he seemed to catch glimpses of her
soul that awed him.At others he would feel himself half inclined
to share the people's belief that she was possessed of powers
occult.And then he would sink into despair of ever understanding the
girl--for he knew that to do so he must be like her, even as to
understand God we must become like Him.After her fourteenth birthday Jose found himself rapidly ceasing to
regard Carmen as a mere child.Not that she did not still often
seem delightfully immature, when her spirits would flow wildly, and
she would draw him into the frolics which had yielded her such
extravagant joy in former days; but that the growth of knowledge and
the rapid development of her thought had seemed to bring to her a
deepening sense of responsibility, a growing impression of maturity,
and an increasing regard for the meaning of life and her part in
it.She had ceased to insist that she would never leave Simiti.And
Jose often thought of late, as he watched her, that he detected
signs of irksomeness at the limitations which her environment
imposed upon her.But, if so, these were never openly expressed; nor
did her manner ever change toward her foster-parents, or toward the
simple and uncomprehending folk of her native town.From the first, Jose had constituted himself her teacher, guide, and
protector.His soured and
rebellious nature had been no barrier to her great love, which had
twined about his heart like ivy around a crumbling tower.And his love
for the child had swelled like a torrent, fed hourly by countless
uncharted streams.He had watched over her like a father; he had
rejoiced to see her bloom into a beauty as rich and luxuriant as the
tropical foliage; he had gazed for hours into the unsearchable abyss
of her black eyes and read there, in ecstasy, a wondrous response to
his love; and when, but a few short days ago, she had again intimated
a future union, a union upon which, even as a child, she had insisted,
yet one which he knew--had always known--utterly, extravagantly
impossible--he had, nevertheless, seized upon the thought with a joy
that was passionate, desperate--and had then flung it from him with a
cry of agony.It was not the disparity of ages; it was not the girl's
present immaturity.In less than a year she would have attained the
marriageable age of these Latin countries.But he could wait two,
three, aye, ten years for such a divine gift!No; the shadow which lay
upon his life was cast by the huge presence of the master whose chains
he wore, the iron links of which, galling his soul, he knew to be
unbreakable.And, as he sat in the gloom of the decayed old church
where he was now a prisoner, the thought that his situation but
symbolized an imprisonment in bonds eternal roused him to a
half-frenzied resolve to destroy himself."Padre dear," the girl had whispered to him that night, just before
the American came again with his disquieting report, "Love will open
the door--Love will set us free.Remember, Paul
thanked God for freedom even while he sat in chains.And I am just as
thankful as he."Jose knew as he kissed her tenderly and bade her go to her place of
rest on the bench beside Dona Maria that death stood between her and
the stained hand of Wenceslas Ortiz.As morning reddened in the eastern sky Don Mario, surrounded by an
armed guard and preceded by his secretary, who beat lustily upon a
small drum, marched pompously down the main street and across the
_plaza_ to the church.Holding his cane aloft he ascended the steps of
the platform and again loudly demanded the surrender of the prisoners
within."The same," reiterated the Alcalde vigorously."Then we will die, Don Mario," he replied sadly, moving
away from the door and leading his little band of harried followers to
the rear of the altar.The Alcalde quickly descended the steps and shouted numerous orders.Several of his men hurried off in various directions, while those
remaining at once opened fire upon the church.In a few moments the
firing was increased, and the entire attack was concentrated upon the
front doors.Shouts and curses filled the morning
air.But it was evident to Jose that his besiegers were meeting with
no opposition from his own supporters in the fight of two days before.The sight of the deadly rifles in the hands of Don Mario's party had
quickly quenched their loyalty to Jose, and led them basely to abandon
him and his companions to their fate.After a few minutes of vigorous assault the attack abruptly ceased,
and Jose was called again to the door."It's Reed," came the American's voice."I've
persuaded the old carrion to let me have a moment's pow-wow with you.Say, give the old buzzard what he wants.Otherwise it's sure death for
you all.I've argued myself sick with him, but he's as set as
concrete.I'll do what I can for you if you come out; but he's going
to have the girl, whether or no.Seems that the Bishop of Cartagena
wants her; and the old crow here is playing politics with him.""Yes, old man," chimed in another voice, which Jose knew to be that of
Harris."You know these fellows are hell on politics."Then to Jose, "What'll I tell the old
duffer?"ejaculated Harris, "if I had a couple of Mausers I could
put these ancient Springfields on the bum in a hurry!""Tell him, friend, that we are prepared to die," replied Jose
drearily, as he turned back into the gloom and took Carmen's hand.The final assault began, and Jose knew that it was only a question of
minutes when the trembling doors would fall.He crouched with his
companions behind the altar, awaiting the inevitable."Love will save us, Padre," she whispered.They don't know what is using them--and it has no power!Rosendo bent over and whispered to Don Jorge, "When the doors fall and
the men rush in, stand you here with me!When they reach the altar we
will throw ourselves upon them, I first, you following, while Juan
will bring Carmen and try to protect her.With our _machetes_ we will
cut our way out.If we find that it is hopeless--then give me
Carmen!"A moment later, as with a loud wail, the two front doors burst asunder
and fell crashing to the floor.A flood of golden sunlight poured into
the dark room.In its yellow wake rushed the mob, with exultant yells.Rosendo rose quickly and placed himself at the head of his little
band.But, ere the first of the frenzied besiegers had crossed the threshold
of the church, a loud cry arose in the _plaza_.Down the main thoroughfare came a volley of shots.Don Mario, half way
through the church door, froze in his tracks.Those of his followers
who had entered, turned quickly and made pellmell for the exit.Their
startled gaze met a company of federal troops rushing down the street,
firing as they came.But the doors were prone upon the floor,
and could not be replaced.Then he and his men scrambled out and
rushed around to one side of the building.As the soldiers came
running up, the Alcalde's followers fired point blank into their
faces, then dropped their guns and fled precipitately.Within an hour staid old Simiti lay in the
grip of martial law, with its once overweening Alcalde, now a meek and
frightened prisoner, arraigned before Captain Morales, holding court
in the shabby town hall.But the court-martial was wholly perfunctory.Though none there but
himself knew it, the captain had come with the disposal of the
unfortunate Don Mario prearranged.A perfunctory hearing of witnesses,
which but increased his approval of his orders, and he pronounced
sentence upon the former Alcalde, and closed the case."Attack upon the church--Assassination of the man Lazaro--Firing upon
federal soldiers--To be shot at sunset, senor," he concluded
solemnly.I was ordered by him to do
it!""_Bien_, senor," replied the captain, whose heart was not wholly
devoid of pity, "produce your letters.""_Senor Capitan_," interposed Jose, "may I plead for the man?He
is--"

"There, Padre," returned the captain, holding up a hand, "it is
useless.Doubtless this has been brought about by motives which you do
not understand.You have a _carcel_
here?_Bien_," addressing his lieutenant, "remove the prisoner to it,
and at sunset let the sentence be carried out."Don Mario, screaming with fear, was dragged from the room."And now, senores," continued the captain calmly, as if nothing out of
the ordinary had occurred, "I appoint Don Fernando, former secretary,
as temporary Alcalde, until such time as the Governor may fill the
office permanently.And," he continued, looking about the room with a
heavy scowl, while the timid people shrank against the wall, "as for
those misguided ones who took part with Don Mario in this anticlerical
uprising--his fate will serve, I think, as a warning!"A hush of horror lay upon the stunned people as they filed slowly out
of the room."_Bien_," added the captain, addressing Fernando, "quarters for my
men, and rations.And let all
arms and ammunition be collected.And we
shall want _peones_ to carry it to the river."Jose turned away, sick with the horror of it all.A soldier approached
him with a message from Don Mario.The condemned man was asking for
the last rites.Faint and trembling, the priest accompanied the
messenger to the jail.wailed the terrified and bewildered Don Mario.Don Wenceslas--"

"Yes, I understand, Don Mario," interrupted Jose, tenderly taking the
man's hand."Yes, Padre," sobbed the unfortunate victim."He said that I would be
rich--that I would be elected to Congress--ah, the traitor!And,
Padre--I burned his letters because it was his wish!Ah, _Santa
Virgen_!"He put his head on the priest's shoulder and wept
violently.Jose's heart was wrung; but he was powerless to aid the man.And yet,
as he dwelt momentarily on his own sorrows, he almost envied the fate
which had overtaken the misguided Don Mario."_Senor Padre_," he said, "the sun is low.In
a quarter of an hour--"

Don Mario sank to the ground and clasped the priest's knees.Jose held
up his hand, and the lieutenant, bowing courteously, withdrew.The
priest knelt beside the cowering prisoner."Don Mario," he said gently, holding the man's hand, "confess all to
me.It may be the means of saving other lives--and then you will have
expiated your own crimes.""Padre," moaned the stricken man, rocking back and forth, his head
buried in his hands and tears streaming through his fingers, "Padre,
you will forgive--?"But remove now the last burden from your soul--the guilty
knowledge of the part Don Wenceslas has had in the disaster which has
come upon Simiti.Tell it all, friend, for you may save many precious
lives thereby."The fallen Alcalde roused himself by a mighty effort.Forgetting for
the moment his own dire predicament, he opened his heart.Jose sat
before him in wide-mouthed astonishment.Don Mario's confession
brought a revelation that left him cold.Then, to Don Mario: "And Carmen?"Don Mario leaned close to the priest and whispered low."No, she is
not Diego's child!And, Padre, take her away, at once!There is not an inch of ground in all Colombia now where she
would be safe from Don Wenceslas!"Then he again took Don Mario's
hand."Friend," he said gravely, "rest assured, what you have told me saves
at least one life, and removes the sin with which your own was
stained.And now," rising and turning to the waiting lieutenant, "we
are ready."Santa Virgen, San Salvador, ora pro
nobis!_

A few minutes later a sharp report echoed through the Simiti valley
and startled the herons that were seeking their night's rest on the
wooded isle.Then Jose de Rincon, alone, and with a heart of lead,
moved slowly down through the dreary village and crossed the deserted
_plaza_ to his lowly abode.CHAPTER 34


The low-hung moon, shrouded in heavy vapor, threw an eldritch shimmer
upon the little group that silently bore the body of the martyred
Lazaro from the old church late that night to the dreary cemetery on
the hill.Jose took but a reluctant part in the proceedings.He would
even have avoided this last service to his faithful friend if he
could.It seemed to him as he stumbled along the stony road behind the
body which Rosendo and Don Jorge carried that his human endurance had
been strained so far beyond the elastic limit that there could now be
no rebound.Every thought that touched his sore mind made it bleed
anew, for every thought that he accepted was acrid, rasping,
oppressive.The sheer weight of foreboding, of wild apprehension, of
paralyzing fear, crushed him, until his shoulders bent low as he
walked.How, lest he perform a miracle, could he hope to extricate
himself and his loved ones from the meshes of the net, far-cast, but
with unerring aim, which had fallen upon them?As he passed the town hall he saw through the open door the captain's
cot, and a guard standing motionless beside it.The captain had
elected to remain there for the night, while his men found a prickly
hospitality among the cowering townsfolk.Jose knew now that the hand
which Don Mario had dealt himself in the game inaugurated by Wenceslas
had been from a stacked deck.He knew that the President of the
Republic had ordered Morales to this inoffensive little town to quell
an alleged anticlerical uprising, and that the execution of the
misguided Alcalde had been determined long before the Hercules had got
under way.He could see that it was necessary for the Government to
sacrifice its agent in the person of the Alcalde, in order to prove
its own loyalty to the Church.And in return therefor he knew it would
expect, not without reason, the cooeperation of the Church in case the
President's interference in the province of Bolivar should precipitate
a general revolt.But what had been determined upon as his own fate?He had not the
semblance of an idea.From the confession of the ruined Alcalde he now
knew that Don Mario had been poisoned against him from the beginning;
that even the letters of introduction which Wenceslas had given him to
the Alcalde contained the charge of his having accomplished the ruin
of the girl Maria in Cartagena, and of his previous incarceration in
the monastery of Palazzola.And Don Mario had confessed in his last
moments that Wenceslas had sought to work through him and Jose in the
hope that the location of the famous mine, La Libertad, might be
revealed.Don Mario had been instructed to get what he could out of
this scion of Rincon; and only his own greed and cupidity had caused
him to play fast and loose with both sides until, falling before the
allurements which Wenceslas held out, he had rushed madly into his own
destruction.Jose realized that so far he himself had proved extremely
useful to Wenceslas--but had his usefulness ended?At these thoughts
his soul momentarily suffused with the pride of the old and hectoring
Rincon stock and rose, instinct with revolt--but only to sink again in
helpless resignation, while the shadow of despair rolled in and
quenched his feeble determination.Rosendo and Don Jorge placed the body in one of the vacant vaults and
filled the entrance with some loose bricks.He had a part to perform,
out there on the bleak hilltop in the ghostly light.But Jose remained
motionless and silent, his head sunk upon his breast.Then Rosendo, waxing troubled, spoke in gentle admonition."He would
expect it, you know, Padre."Bitter tears coursed down his
cheeks, and his voice broke.He laid his head on Rosendo's stalwart
shoulder and wept aloud.The sickly, greenish cast of the moonlight silhouetted the figures of
the three men in grotesque shapes against the cemetery wall and the
crumbling tombs.The morose call of a toucan floated weirdly upon the
heavy air.The faint wail of the frogs in the shallow waters below
rose like the despairing sighs of lost souls.Rosendo wound his long arm about the sorrowing priest.Don Jorge's
muscles knotted, and a muttered imprecation rose from his tight lips.Strangely had the shift and coil of the human mind thrown together
these three men, so different in character, yet standing now in united
protest against the misery which men heap upon their fellow-men in the
name of Christ.Jose, the apostate agent of Holy Church, his hands
bound, and his heart bursting with yearning toward his fellow-men;
Rosendo, simple-minded and faithful, chained to the Church by heredity
and association, yet ashamed of its abuses and lusts; Don Jorge,
fierce in his denunciation of the political and religious sham and
hypocrisy which he saw masking behind the cloak of imperial religion."I have nothing to say, friends," moaned Jose, raising his head;
"nothing that would not still further reveal my own miserable weakness
and the despicable falsity of the Church.If the Church had followed
the Christ, it would have taught me to do likewise; and I should now
call to Lazaro and bid him come forth, instead of shamefully
confessing my impotency and utter lack of spirituality, even while I
pose as an _Alter Christus_.""You--you will leave a blessing with him before we go, Padre?"queried
the anxious Rosendo, clinging still to the frayed edge of his fathers'
faith."My blessing, Rosendo," replied Jose sadly, "would do no good.He lies
there because we have utterly forgotten what the Master came to teach.He lies there because of our false, undemonstrable, mortal beliefs.Oh, that the Church, instead of wasting time murmuring futile prayers
over dead bodies, had striven to learn to do the deeds which the
Christ said we should all do if we but kept his commandments!""But, Padre, you will say Masses for him?"I would not take his or your money to
give to the Church to get his soul out of an imagined purgatory which
the Church long ago invented for the purpose of enriching herself
materially--for, alas!after spiritual riches she has had little
hankering.""To pay God to get His own children out of the flames, eh?""It is what I have always said, the religion of the Church
is a _religion de dinero_.If there ever was a God, either He is still
laughing Himself sick at our follies--or else He has wept Himself to
death over them!"Friend," said Jose solemnly, turning to Don Jorge, "I long since
learned what the whole world must learn some time, that the Church
stands to-day, not as the bride of the Christ, but as the incarnation
of the human mind, as error opposed to Truth.It is the embodiment of
'Who shall be greatest?'It is one of the various phenomena of the
human mentality; and its adherents are the victims of authoritative
falsehood.Its Mass and countless other ceremonies differ in no
essential respect from ancient pagan worship.And so it can do none of the works of the Master.Its corrupting
faith is foully materialistic.And as the human mind expands, the incoming light must drive out the
black beliefs and deeds of Holy Church, else the oncoming centuries
will have no place for it.""But why do you still remain a
priest?I knew when I saw you on the river boat that you
were none.But," his voice dropping to a whisper, "there is a soldier
in the road below.He might think we were
here to plot."When the soldier had passed, they quietly left the gloomy cemetery and
made their way quickly back through the straggling moonlight to
Rosendo's house.Dona Maria, with characteristic quietude, was
preparing for the duties of the approaching day.Jose went to her bedside and bent over her, wondering.What were the
events of the past few days in her sight?What did Lazaro's death and the
execution of Don Mario mean to her?Did she, as he had done, look upon
them as real events in a real world, created and governed by a good
God?Or did she still hold such things to be the unreal phenomena of
the human mentality?--unreal, because opposed to God, and without the
infinite principle.As for himself, how had the current of his life
been diverted by this rare child!What had she not sought to teach him
by her simple faith, her unshaken trust in the immanence of good!True, as a pure reflection of good she had seemed to be the means of
stirring up tremendous evil.But had he not seen the evil eventually
consume itself, leaving her unscathed?He himself had always conceded to the forces of evil as great power as
to those of good--nay, even greater.And even now as he stood looking
at her, wrapped in peaceful slumber, his strained sight caught no
gleam of hope, no light flashing through the heavy clouds of
misfortune that lowered above her.He turned away with an anxious
sigh."Padre," said the gentle Dona Maria, "the two _Americanos_--"

"Ah, yes," interrupted Jose, suddenly remembering that he had sent
word to them to use his house while they remained in the town."They brought their baggage to your house an hour ago and set up their
beds in your living room."Good," he replied, a wistful sense of gratitude stealing over him at
the reassuring thought of their presence."_Bien_, we will not disturb
them."Summoning Rosendo and Don Jorge, the three men sought the lake's edge.There, seated on the loose shales, they wrestled with their problem
until dawn spread her filmy veil over the shimmering stars.*       *       *       *       *

Long before sun-up the soldiers and the _peones_, whom Captain Morales
had impressed, were busy gathering the commandeered rifles and
carrying them down to the gunboat Hercules, waiting at the mouth of
the Boque river, some six or eight miles distant, and over a wild
trail.The townsfolk, thoroughly frightened, hugged the shelter of
their homes, and left the streets to the troops.Though they detested
the soldiers, yet none would lightly risk a blow from the heavy hand
of Morales, whose authority on a punitive expedition of this sort was
unlimited.The summary execution of the Alcalde had stricken them with
horror, and left an impression which never would be erased from their
memories.Immediately after the early _desayuno_ the captain appeared at
Rosendo's door.He had come to say farewell to the priest.All of the
soldiers had disappeared down the trail, with the exception of the two
who formed the captain's small personal escort."_Conque, adios, Senor Padre_" he called cheerily, as he approached.Jose was sitting at table with Rosendo's family and Don Jorge.Instinctively he rose hastily, and seizing Carmen, thrust her into the
adjoining bedroom and closed the door.Then he went out to face the
captain."Much excitement for your little _pueblo_, no?"exclaimed the captain
with a bluff laugh as he grasped Jose's hand."But a lesson like this
will last a century.I rejoice that I found it unnecessary to burn the
town.""_Senor Capitan_, I, too, rejoice.But--the state of the country--what may we expect?""_Caramba, Padre mio_!There
is much talk, many angry looks, much gesturing and waving of hands.The President sees fit to send me here, without
order from the Departmental Governor.He shrugged his shoulders with that expressive Latin
gesture which indicates complete irresponsibility for and indifference
to results."_Bueno pues, Senor Capitan_,"
he said hurriedly."I wish you every felicitation on your return trip.Ah--ah--your orders contained no reference to--to me?""None whatever, _Senor Padre_," replied the captain genially.He
turned to go, and Jose stifled a great sigh of relief.But suddenly
the captain stopped; then turned again.He fumbled in an inner pocket and drew forth a telegraphic document."_And you will seize the person of one Rosendo Ariza's daughter and
immediately send her with proper conveyance to the Sister Superior of
the convent of Our Lady in Cartagena_," he read aloud.From within Rosendo's house came a soft,
scurrying sound.Morales returned
the folded message to his pocket and started to enter the house.He was rendered suddenly inert, although
vividly conscious of a drama about to be enacted in which he and his
loved ones would play leading _roles_.As in a dream he heard the
captain address Rosendo and gruffly demand that he produce his
daughter.He heard a deep curse from Rosendo; and his blood congealed
more thickly as he dwelt momentarily on the old man's possible conduct
in the face of the federal demand.He heard Morales hunting
impatiently through the shabby rooms.Then he saw him emerge in a
towering rage--but empty-handed.cried the angry captain, "but what is this?Have
they not had one good lesson, that I must inflict another?I demand to
know, has this Rosendo Ariza a daughter?"He stood waiting for the answer that Jose knew he must make.The
priest's hollow voice sounded like an echo from another world."_Bien_, then I have discovered one honest man in yourself, Padre.You
will now assist me in finding her.""I--I know not--where--where she is, _Senor Capitan_," murmured Jose
with feebly fluttering lips.They were alone, this little party of actors, although many an eye
peered out timidly at them from behind closed shutters and barred
doors around the _plaza_.Don Jorge and Rosendo came out of the house
and stood behind Jose.The captain confronted them, bristling with
wrath at the insolence that dared oppose his supreme authority.The
heat had already begun to pour down in torrents.The morning air was
light, but not a sound traversed it.The principals in this tense
drama might have been painted against that vivid tropical background.Then Harris, moved by his piquant Yankee curiosity, appeared at the
door of the parish house, his great eyes protruding and his head
craned forth like a monster heron."Perhaps the _Americano_ hides the daughter of Ariza!"But ere he reached it Reed suddenly
appeared from behind Harris.In his hand he grasped a large American
flag.Holding this high above his head, he blocked the entrance."We are
American citizens, and this house is under the protection of the
American Government!"Morales fell back and stood with mouth agape in astonishment.The
audacity of this foreign adventurer fairly robbed him of his breath.He glanced dubiously from him to the priest.Then, to save the
situation, he broke into an embarrassed laugh."_Bien_, my good friend," he finally said, addressing Reed in his
courtliest manner, "all respect to your excellent Government.And, if
you will accept it, I shall be pleased to secure you a commission in
the Colombian army.But, my orders--you understand, do you not?The
sun is already high, and I can not lose more time.Therefore, you will
kindly stand aside and permit me to search that house."He motioned to
his men and moved forward.Still holding aloft the flag, Reed drew a long revolver.Harris
quickly produced one of equal size and wicked appearance.Morales
stopped abruptly and looked at them in hesitation.His chief delight
when not in the field was the perusal of a battered history of the
American Civil War; and his exclamations of admiration for the
hardihood of those who participated in it were always loud and
frequent.But he, too, had a reputation to sustain.The Americans
stood grimly silent before him.Harris's finger twitched nervously
along the trigger, and a smile played over his thin lips.Then, his face flaming with shame and chagrin, Morales turned to his
escort and commanded them to advance.A moment more, and--

A cry came from Rosendo's house.Ana, her face swollen with weeping,
clasping her sightless babe to her bosom, had emerged and faced the
captain."Senor," she said in a voice strained to a whisper, "I am the daughter
of Rosendo Ariza."A half-suppressed exclamation burst from the lips of Rosendo.A
desperate, suffocating joy surged over the riven soul of the priest.Don Jorge's mouth opened, but no sound came forth.This precipitate
_denouement_ held them rigid with astonishment.In the eyes of Jose Ana's
tense figure, standing grim and rigid before the captain, took on a
dignity that was majestic, a worth that transcended all human
computation.A Magdalen, yes, standing with her sin-conceived child
clasped in her trembling arms.this
sacrificial act broke the alabaster box and spread the precious nard
over the feet of the pitying Christ."It is," murmured the dazed priest, scarce hearing his own words."But--I have no orders respecting a child--"

"They cannot be separated," half whispered Jose, not daring to meet
the vacant gaze of the babe.Then, with an upward glance at
the sun, he gave a sharp command to his men.Placing the woman between
them, the two soldiers faced about and moved quickly away.With a low
bow and a final "_Adios, Senores_," the captain hurriedly joined them.Ere the little group before Rosendo's house had collected their wits,
the soldiers and their frail charge had mounted the hill beyond the
old church and disappeared into the matted trail that led from it to
the distant river.Rosendo was the first to break the mesmeric silence.His knees gave way beneath him and he buried his face in his
hands.Then he rose hastily, and made as if to pursue the soldiers.cried Don Jorge, "but it is the hand of Providence!Listen, friend Rosendo, it but gives us time to act!When the mistake is discovered they will return,
and they will bring her back unharmed--though they may not learn until
she reaches Cartagena!_Bien_, we can not waste time in mourning now!Rosendo strove to unravel his tangled wits.Jose went to him and
clasped his big hand."Rosendo--friend--would you have it different?I--I alone am to blame
that they took Anita!But--it was to save--to save--Ah, God!if I did
wrong, take the American's revolver and shoot me!"He tore open his
cassock and stood rigid before the dazed man.Anguish and soul-torture
had warped his features."We
shall find plenty of others more deserving of shooting, I think!Reed turned back into the parish house, and emerged a moment later
with Carmen and Dona Maria, who knew not as yet of Ana's departure."I
hid them in your bedroom, Padre," Reed explained."Dona Maria," he cried, "do you
take Carmen into your house and await our decision!And you, men, go
into my study!It is as Don Jorge says, we must act quickly!It may serve to protect us further
against the angry people of Simiti!"The five men quickly gathered in Jose's living room in a strained,
excited group.Rapidly he related
in detail Don Mario's last confession.When he had closed, Reed made
reply."Old man," he said, familiarly addressing Jose, "having seen the girl,
I do not at all wonder that blood has been shed over her.But to keep
her another hour in Simiti is to sacrifice her.Sandra moved to the garden.If not, the people will drive you out.With the soldiers gone, the people will rise up against
you all.""But, friend, where shall we go?""There is
no place in Colombia now where she would be safe!""It can not be done," interposed Don Jorge."It would be impossible
for him to escape down the river with the girl, even if he had funds
to carry her away from Colombia, which he has not.To take the trail would only postpone for a short
time their certain capture.And then--well, we will not predict!To
flee into the jungle--or to hide among the _peones_ along the
trails--that might be done--yes.""What's the gibberish about now, pal?"put in Harris, whose knowledge
of the Spanish tongue was _nil_."Well, that's easy," returned Harris."Tell 'em you'll take the girl
out yourself.She's white enough to pass as your daughter, you know."Rosendo, stunned by the sudden departure of Ana, had sat in a state of
stupefaction during this conversation.But now he roused up and turned
to Reed.The latter translated his friend's suggestion, laughing as he
commented on its gross absurdity.Rosendo dropped his head again upon his chest and lapsed into silence.Then he rose unsteadily and passed a hand slowly across his brow.A
strange light had come into his eyes.For a moment he stood looking
fixedly at Reed."Senores," he said, rolling his syllables sonorously, "the time has
come at last!For years I have waited, waited, knowing that some day
the great gift which the good God put into my hands for the little
Carmen would be needed.The cruel
Spaniards drove them to and from their heavy labors with the lash; and
when the great war ended, they sank exhausted into their graves.My
parents--I have not told you this, Padre--were the slaves of Don
Ignacio de Rincon!"An exclamation burst from the astonished priest's lips.What, then,
had this man been concealing all these years?Little wonder that he
had hesitated when he learned that a Rincon had come to the parish of
Simiti!As he continued, his recital became
dramatic.As they listened, his auditors sat spellbound."Don Ignacio de Rincon himself was kind of heart.But his overseers--ah,
_Dios arriba_!Many a time the great lash wound
itself about my poor father's shrinking body, and hurled him shrieking to
the ground--and why?Because his blistered hands could not hold the
_batea_ with which he washed gold for your grandfather, Padre, your
grandfather!"A groan escaped him, and tears
trickled slowly down his sunken cheeks."I bear you no malice, Padre," continued Rosendo."It was hard those
first days to accept you here.But when, during your fever, I
learned from your own lips what you had suffered, I knew that you
needed a friend, and I took you to my bosom.And now I am glad--ah,
very glad, that I did so.But, though my confidence in you increased
day by day, I could never bring myself to tell you my great
secret--the secret that now I reveal for the sake of the little
Carmen.Padre--senores--I--_I am the owner of the great mine, La
Libertad_!"Had the heavens collapsed the astonishment of Don Jorge and the priest
could not have been greater.The coming of the soldiers, the terrific
strain of the past few days, culminating in the loss of Ana--all was
for the moment obliterated.Rosendo paused a moment for the effect which he knew his revelation
would produce, and then went on rapidly:

"Padre, the mine belonged to your grandfather.The gold taken from it was brought down the Guamoco trail to
Simiti, and from here shipped to Cartagena, where he lived in great
elegance.I make no doubt the gold which you and the little Carmen
discovered in the old church that day came from this same wonderful
mine.But the ore was quartz, and _arrastras_ were required to grind
it, and much skill was needed, too.He had men from old Spain, deeply
versed in such knowledge.Ah, the tales my poor father told of that
mine!"_Bien_, the war broke out.The Guamoco region became depopulated, and
sank back into the jungle.The location of the mine had been recorded
in Cartagena; but, as you know, when Don Ignacio fled from this
country he destroyed the record.He did the same with the records in
Simiti, on that last flying trip here, when he hid the gold in the
altar of the old church.And then the jungle grew up around the mine
during those thirteen long years of warfare--the people who knew of it
died off--and the mine was lost, utterly lost!"The little group sat enthralled before him.All
but Harris, who was vainly beseeching Reed to translate to him the
dramatic story."Padre," continued Rosendo at length, "from what my father had told me
I had a vague idea of the location of that mine.And many a weary day
I spent hunting for it!It was while I was on the Tigui, washing gold.I was
working near what we used to call _Pozo Cayman_, opposite La Colorado,
where the Frenchmen died.I camped on the lonely bank there, with only
the birds and the wondering animals to keep me company.One dark
night, as I lay on the ground, I had a dream.I dreamt that the Virgin, all in white, came to me where I
lay--that she whispered to me and told me to rise quickly and drive
away the devil.It was still dark, but a pair of fiery eyes were
gleaming at me from the bush.I seized my _machete_ and started after
them.It was a jaguar, Padre, and he fled up the hill from me.Why I
followed, I know not, unless I thought, still half asleep as I was,
that I was obeying the Virgin."At the top of the hill I lost the animal--and myself, as well.I am a
good woodsman, senores, and not easily lost.But this time my poor
head went badly astray.At last I
came to the edge of a steep ravine.I clambered down the sides into
the gully below.I thought it looked like an old trail, and I followed
it.So narrow was it at times that the walls almost touched.Then it widened, and I knew that at last I was in a trail,
long since abandoned--and how old, only the good God himself knew!"But my story grows as long as the trail!On and on I went, crossing
stream after stream, scaring snakes from my path, frightening the
birds above, who doubtless have never seen men in that region, all the
time thinking I was going toward the Tigui, until at last the old
sunken trail led me up a tremendous hill.At the top, buried in a
dense matting of brush, I fell over a circle of stones.They were the
remains of an ancient _arrastra_.Further on I found another; and
still another.Then, near them, the stone foundations of houses, long
since gone to decay.From these the trail took me into a gully, where
but little water flowed.I struck
off a piece from one of the largest.I went on up the stream, striking
off piece after piece from the great rocks.Every one showed specks of
free gold.Tunnel after tunnel yawned at me from the hillside.Some of
these were still open, where they had been driven through the hard
rock.I had my wallet, in which I always carry
matches and a bit of candle.far within I crossed a quartz vein--I scraped it with my
_machete_.it could not have been less than six feet in
width--and all speckled with gold!Above it, far into the blackness,
where bats were scurrying madly, the ore had been taken out long, long
ago.In the darkness below I stumbled over old, rusted tools.Every
one bore the inscription, 'I de R.'Your grandfather, Padre, put his
stamp on everything belonging to him.Then, as I sat trying to place
myself, my father's oft-told story of the location of the mine flashed
into my brain.I was at the headwaters of the Borrachera._And I had discovered La
Libertad_!"Reed's eager ears had drunk in every word of the old man's dramatic
story.When Rosendo
paused again, he quickly asked:

"The title, senor?"Rosendo drew forth a paper from his bosom."You will recall, Padre," he said, addressing the dully wondering
Jose, "that I once asked you to give me a name for a mine--a rare
name?And you told me to call it the--the--what is it?""Yes," exclaimed the old man excitedly, "that is it!_Bien_, I told no
one of my discovery of years before.I had never had money enough to
get the title to it.But when it seemed that I
might soon have use for it I sold my _finca_ for funds and had Lazaro
apply through Don Mario for title to a mine called--called--"

"The Chicago mine," said Jose, again coming to the rescue._Bien_, Lazaro got the title, which I never could have done,
for at that time Don Mario would not have put through any papers for
me.I then had the unsuspecting Lazaro transfer the title to me,
and--_Bien_, I am the sole owner of La Libertad!"Reed examined the paper at some length, and then handed it back to
Rosendo."Can we not talk business, senor?""I am so situated that I can float an American company
to operate this mine, and allow you a large percentage of the returns.he exclaimed, unable longer to contain himself, "it is
your fortune!""Senor," replied Rosendo, slowly shaking his head, "I want no share in
any of your American companies.But--your friend--he has suggested
just what has been running through my mind ever since you came to
Simiti."The wild, terrifying idea tore through
his fraught brain.He turned quickly to Reed and addressed him in
English."Such a thing is
quite out of the question!"Priest, Reed's wife is
in Cartagena, waiting for him.Came down from New York that far for
the trip.What's to prevent her from taking
the girl to the States and placing her in a boarding school there
until such time as you can either follow, or this stew down here has
settled sufficiently to permit of her returning to you?"Reed threw up a deprecatory hand."But," interposed Harris exasperatedly, "would you leave the ravishing
little beauty here to fall into the hands of the cannibals who are
trailing her?if it weren't for the looks of the thing I'd
take her myself.But you've got a wife, so it'd be easy."He leaned
over to Reed and concluded in a whisper, "The old man's going to make
a proposition--listen!""But," remonstrated the latter, "the expense of keeping her in New
York indefinitely!For, unless I mistake much, none of these people
will ever see the States after she leaves.And then I have an adopted
daughter on my hands!now that my ambitious wife is
determined to break into New York society with her adorable sister, I
have no money to waste on adopted children!"Rosendo, who had been studying the Americans attentively during their
conversation, now laid a hand on Reed's."Senor," he said in a quiet
tone, "if you will take the little Carmen with you, and keep her safe
from harm until Padre Jose can come to you, or she can be returned to
us here, I will transfer to you a half interest in this mine."he cried wildly, "do not do that!_Dios arriba_, no!Ah, senor," turning to Reed, "I beg you will
forgive--but Rosendo is mad to suggest such a thing!We cannot permit
it--we--I--oh, God above!"He sank again into his chair and covered
his face with his hands.Don Jorge gave vent to a long, low whistle.Rosendo, his voice husky
and his lips trembling, went on:

"I know, Padre--I know.I will give the mine to
the American--and to Carmen.He has a powerful government back of him,
and he is able to defend the title and save her interest as well as
his own.As for me, I--_Bien_, I shall want nothing when Carmen
goes--nothing.""If you
don't tell me what all this is about now I shall shoot--and not
straight up, either!""Senores," said Reed in a controlled voice, "let me talk this matter
over with my friend here.Rosendo and Don Jorge bowed and silently withdrew from the parish
house.The former went at once to apprise the wondering Dona Maria of
the events which had crowded the morning's early hours and to answer
her apprehensive questionings regarding Ana.Carmen was to know only
that Ana--but what could he tell her?That the woman had sacrificed
herself for the girl?No; but that they had seized this opportunity to
send her, under the protection of Captain Morales, to the Sisters of
the Convent of Our Lady.The old man knew that the girl would see only
God's hand in the event.It seemed to him that once his arms
closed about her no power under the skies could tear them asunder.He
found her sitting in the doorway at the rear of Rosendo's house,
looking dreamily out over the placid lake.Cucumbra, now old and
feeble, slept at her feet.As the man approached he heard her murmur
repeatedly, "It is not true--it is not true--it is not true!""Gladly, Padre--but where?""God only knows--to the end of the world!""Well, Padre dear," she softly replied, as she smiled up into his
drawn face, "we will start out.But I think we had better rest when we
reach the shales, don't you?"CHAPTER 35


"No, Padre dear," with an energetic shake of her head, "no.Not even
after all that has seemed to happen to us do I believe it true.No, I
do not believe it real.It does not exist,
excepting in the human mind.And that, as you yourself know, can not
be real, for it is all that God is not."They were seated beneath the slowly withering _algarroba_ tree out on
the burning shales.Jose still held the girl's hand tightly in his.Again he was struggling with self, struggling to pass the borderline
from, self-consciousness to God-consciousness; striving, under the
spiritual influence of this girl, to break the mesmeric hold of his
own mortal beliefs, and swing freely out into his true orbit about the
central Sun, infinite Mind.The young girl, burgeoning into a marvelous womanhood, sat before him
like an embodied spirit.Her beauty of soul shone out in gorgeous
luxuriance, and seemed to him to envelop her in a sheen of radiance.The brilliant sunshine glanced sparkling from her glossy hair into a
nimbus of light about her head.Her rich complexion was but faintly
suggestive to him of a Latin origin.Her oval face and regular
features might have indicated any of the ruddier branches of the
so-called Aryan stock.But his thought was not dwelling on these
things now.It was brooding over the events of the past few weeks, and
their probable consequences."Padre dear," she had said, when his tremulous voice ceased, "how
much longer will you believe that two and two are seven?And how much
longer will you try to make me believe it?Oh, Padre, at first you did
seem to see so clearly, and you talked so beautifully to me!And then,
when things seemed to go wrong, you went right back to your old
thoughts and opened the door and let them all in again.And so things
couldn't help getting worse for you.You told me yourself, long ago,
that you would have to empty your mind of its old beliefs.But I guess
you didn't get them all out.If you had cleaned house and got your
mind ready for the good thoughts, they would have come in.You know,
you have to get ready for the good, before it can come.But you go right on getting ready for evil.If you loved
God--really _loved_ Him--why, you would not be worried and anxious
to-day, and you would not be believing still that two and two are
seven.You told me, oh, so long ago!that this human life was just a
_sense_ of life, a series of states of consciousness, and that
consciousness was only mental activity, the activity of thought.Well,
I remembered that, and put it into practice--but you didn't.A true
consciousness is the activity of true thought, you said.A false
consciousness is the activity of false thought.True thought comes
from God, who is mind.False thought is the opposite of true thought,
and doesn't come from any mind at all, but is just supposition.A
supposition is never really created, because it is never real--never
truth.True thought becomes externalized to us in good, in harmony, in
happiness.False thought becomes externalized to us in unhappiness,
sickness, loss, in wrong-doing, and in death.It is unreal, and yet
awfully real to those who believe it to be real.Why don't you act
your knowledge, as you at first said you were going to do?I have all
along tried to do this.Whenever thoughts come to me I always look
carefully at them to see whether they are based on any real principle,
on God.Sometimes it
has been hard to tell just which were true and which false.And
sometimes I got caught, and had to pay the penalty.But every day I do
better; and the time will come at last when I shall be able to tell at
once which thoughts are true and which untrue.When that time comes,
nothing but good thoughts will enter, and nothing but good will be
externalized to me in consciousness.I shall be in heaven--all the
heaven there is.It is the heaven which Jesus talked so much about,
and which he said was within us all.It is so simple, Padre dear, so
simple!"The man sat humbly before her like a rebuked child.Indeed, these were the very things that he had taught her
himself.Why, then, had he failed to demonstrate them?Only because
he had attempted to mix error with truth--had clung to the reality and
immanence of evil, even while striving to believe good omnipotent and
infinite.He had worked out these theories, and they had appeared
beautiful to him.But, while Carmen had eagerly grasped and
assimilated them, even to the consistent shaping of her daily life to
accord with them, he had gone on putting the stamp of genuineness and
reality upon every sort of thought and upon every human event as it
had been enacted in his conscious experience.His difficulty was that,
having proclaimed the allness of spirit, God, he had proceeded to bow
the knee to evil.Carmen had seemed to know that the mortal, material
concepts of humanity would dissolve in the light of truth.He, on the
other hand, had clung to them, even though they seared the mind that
held them, and became externalized in utter wretchedness."When you let God's thoughts in, Padre, and drive out their
opposites, then sickness and unhappiness will disappear, just as
the mist disappears over the lake when the sun rises and the light
goes through it.If you really expected to some day see the now
'unseen things' of God, you would get ready for them, and you would
'rejoice always,' even though you did seem to see the wickedness of
Padre Diego, the coming of the soldiers, the death of Lazaro and Don
Mario, and lots of unhappiness about yourself and me.Those men are
not dead--except to your thought.You ought to know that all these
things are the unreal thoughts externalized in your consciousness.And, knowing them for what they really are, the opposites of God's
thoughts, you ought to know that they can have no more power over
you than anything else that you know to be supposition.We can
suppose that two and two are seven, but we can't make it true.The
supposition does not have any effect upon us.But as regards just thought--and you yourself said that everything
reduces to thought--why, people seem to think it is different.Don't you understand what the good man Jesus meant when he
told the Pharisees to first cleanse the cup and platter within,
that the outside might also be clean?Why, that was a clear case of
externalization, if there ever was one!Cleanse your thought, and
everything outside of you will then become clean, for your clean
thought will become externalized.You once said that you believed
in the theory that 'like attracts like.'I believe that
good thoughts attract good ones, and evil thoughts attract thoughts
like themselves.And you ought to know that your
life shows it, too.You hold fear-thoughts and worry-thoughts, and
then, just as soon as these become externalized to you as misfortune
and unhappiness, you say that evil is real and powerful, and that
God permits it to exist.Yes, God does permit all the existence
there is to a supposition--which is none.You pity yourself and all
the world for being unhappy, when all you need is to do as Jesus told
you, and know God to be infinite Mind, and evil to be only the
suppositional opposite, without reality, without life, without
power--unless you give it these things in your own consciousness.You
don't have to take thought for your life.You don't have to be
covetous, or envious, or fearful, or anxious.You couldn't do
anything if you were.Jesus said that
of himself he could do nothing.But--as soon as he recognized God as
the infinite principle of all, and acted that knowledge--why, then
he raised the dead!And at last, when his understanding was greater,
he dissolved the mental concept which people called his human body.Don't you see it, Padre--don't you?And yet:

"But, Carmen, padre Rosendo would send you out of the country with
these Americans!"And you have said that you have always feared
you would lose me.I have not
feared that I would lose you.But, Padre dear--"

The ghastly look on the man's face threw wide the flood-gates of her
sympathy."Padre--all things work together for good, you know.Listen--" She clung more closely to
him."Padre, it may be best, after all.You do not want me to stay always
in Simiti.And if I go, you will go with me, or soon follow.Oh, Padre
dear, you have told me that up in that great country above us the
people do not know God as you and I are learning to know Him.Padre--I
want to go and tell them about Him!I've wanted to for a long, long
time."The girl's eyes shone with a holy light.Her wistful face glowed with
a love divine."Padre dear, you have so often said that I had a message for the
world.Do not the people up north need that message?The people of Simiti are too dull to hear the message
now.But up there--Oh, Padre, it may be right that I should go!And, if it is right, nothing can prevent it, for the right _will_ be
externalized!Such a spirit as hers could not
long be confined within the narrow verges of Simiti.He must not
oppose his egoism to her interests.And, besides, he might follow
soon.it might be the opening of the
way to the consummation of that heart-longing for--

Ah, the desperate joy that surged through his yearning soul at the
thought!A year, two, three, and he would still
be a young man!She loved him--never had man had such proofs as he of
an affection so divine!"Carmen," he said tenderly, drawing her closer to him, "you may be
right.Yes--we will both go with the Americans.Once out of this
environment and free from ecclesiastical chains, I shall do better."The girl looked up at him with brimming eyes."Padre dear," she
whispered, "I want to go--away from Simiti.Juan--he asks me almost
every day to marry him.Even in
the church, when Don Mario was trying to get us, Juan said he would
save me if I would promise to marry him.He said he would go to
Cartagena and kill the Bishop.He--Padre,
he is a good boy.But--I do not--want to marry him."Jose knew how insistent Juan had
become."Padre, you--you are not always going to be a priest--are you?And--I--I--oh, Padre dear, I love you so!"She turned impulsively and
threw both arms about his neck."I want to see you work out your
problem.You can go with me--and I can always live
with you--and some day--some day--" She buried her face in his
shoulder.The artless girl had never seemed to think it unmaidenly to
declare her love for him, to show him unmistakably that she hoped to
become his wife.The beautiful child in his arms
was human!Young in years, and yet a woman by the conventions of these
tropic lands.Why, she had long
insisted that she would wait for him!And why should he now oppose the
externalization of that sweet thought?"Ah, _chiquita_," he murmured, "I will indeed go with you now!I will
send my resignation to the Bishop at once.No, I will wait and send it
from the States.I will renounce my oath, abjure my promise--"

The girl sat suddenly upright and looked earnestly into his eyes.But--I promised my mother, dearest one,
that I would always remain a priest--unless, indeed, the Church
herself should eject me from the priesthood.But, it was foolish--"

"And your mother--she expects you to keep your word?"The girl sat in pensive silence for a moment."But, Padre," she
resumed, "honesty--it is the very first thing that God requires of us.We have to be--we _must_ be honest, for He is Truth.He cannot see or
recognize error, you know.And so He cannot see you and help you if
you are dishonest."And I tried to be honest, even when circumstances and
my own poor resistive force combined to direct me into the priesthood.But--since that day I have lived a life of hypocrisy, not knowing how
to shape my course."But, Padre, the Church has not put you out?"But, if you went to the States--with me--would you be put out of the
Church?""Possibly, _chiquita_.""And what would that mean, Padre?""The disgrace that always attaches to an apostate priest, child.""And, Padre--your mother--what would she say?""It would kill her," he replied slowly.Carmen reflected long, while Jose, with ebbing hope, waited."Padre
dear," she finally said, "then you have not yet worked out your
problem--have you?"And he was now attempting to solve it by flight."I mean, Padre, you have not worked it out in God's way.For if you
had, no one would be hurt, and there could not be any disgrace, or
unhappiness--could there?""But, _chiquita_," he cried in despair, "nothing but excommunication
can release me!And I long ago ceased to look for that.You do not
understand--you are young!"Why, Padre dear, you can work it out, all out, in God's way.""But--must I remain here--can I let you go alone with the Americans--?""Yes, you can, if it is right," she answered gently.he cried, straining her in his arms."If you go with the
Americans, I shall, I must, go too!""Not unless it is right, Padre," she insisted."If it is right,
nothing can keep you from going.But, unless it is God's way--well,
you can not solve your problem by running away from it.""But--child--to remain here means--God above!you don't realize what
it may mean to us both!"Jose began to feel that they were
drifting hopelessly, abysmally apart."I have been cheated and thwarted all my
wretched life!I can not, would not, hold
you here, if the way opens for you to go!But--I can not remain here
without you--and live!""That is not true, Padre," replied the girl, slowly shaking her head."No human being is necessary to any one's happiness.You are trying to 'acquire that mind which was in
Christ.'If you are really progressing, why, you will surely be happy.But you must work it all out God's way.""And that--"

"You must be honest, Padre, honest with Him and with everybody.If you
can no longer be a priest--if you are not one, and never have been
one--you must be honest with the Church and with yourself.Why do you not write to the Bishop and
tell him all about it?You must--Padre, you _must_--be honest!Write to your
mother--write to the Bishop.But--oh,
Padre dear, you must trust Him, and you must--you _must_--know that He
is good, that He is infinite, and that there is no evil!Otherwise,
the good can not be externalized.If you did that, your problem would
be quickly solved.""Padre dear," she continued, "God is
life--there is no death.God is all
good--there is no poverty, no lack, no loss.God is infinite, and He
is mind--there is no inability to see the right and to do it.God is
my mind, my spirit, my soul, my all.I look at God constantly, and strive always to see only Him.But He is just as much to you as He is to me.You can not outline how
things will work out; but you can know that they can only work out in
the right way.Only by so doing can
you solve your problem.And I have
always worked for you that way.I have always thought the time would
come when you and I would live and work together--always.I have not said that it _had_ to be.If it works
out that way, I know I would be very happy.But, even if it does not,
I shall know that I can not be deprived of any good, for the good God
is everywhere, and He is love, and He has given me all happiness.And
now we must leave everything to Him, while we work, work, work to see
Him only everywhere."Suffering himself to be led by her, they
crossed the shales to the dust-laden road and made their way silently
through the burning heat into the village.At the door of the parish house stood Rosendo.His face was grave, but
his manner calm."Padre," he announced, "it is arranged."Jose's knees shook under him as he followed the old man into the
house.Reed, Harris, and Don Jorge sat about the table, on which were
strewn papers covered with figures and sketches.The priest sat down
dumbly and drew Carmen to him.Harris fell to devouring the girl with
his bulging eyes.Reed at once plunged into the topic under
consideration."I have been saying," he began, addressing the priest, "that I can
accept the proposal made by Don Rosendo, but with some amendments.Harris and I are under contract with the Molino Company to report upon
their properties along the Boque river.I am informed by Don Rosendo
that he is acquainted with these alleged mines, and knows them to be
worthless.Be that as it may, I am obliged to examine them.But I will
agree to take this girl to New York, under the protection of my wife,
upon the consideration that when I reach my home city I be allowed to
form a company to take over this mine, returning to the girl a
fifty-one per cent interest in the stock, one half of which she agrees
in writing to deliver to me immediately upon its issuance.Being under
contract, I can not accept it now.The balance of the stock must be
sold for development purposes.I further agree to place the girl in a
boarding school of the first quality in the States, and to bear all
expenses of her maintenance until such time as she is either
self-supporting, or one or several of you may come to her, or effect
her return to Colombia.Now, according to Ariza's sketches, we may
proceed up the Boque river to its headwaters--how far did you say,
friend?""Some hundred and fifty miles from Simiti, senor," replied Rosendo."And then," resumed Reed, "we can cut across country from the sources
of the Boque, following what is known as Rosario creek, down to the
river Tigui, striking the latter somewhere near the ancient point
known as La Colorado.""But, senor," interposed Rosendo, "remember that the headwaters of the
Boque are practically unknown to-day.Many years ago, when I was a
small lad, some liberated slaves worked along Rosario creek, which was
then one day's journey on foot with packs from La Colorado.But that
old trail has long since disappeared.Probably no one has been over it
since.""Very well," returned the practical Reed, "then we shall have to make
our own trail across the divide to the Tigui.But once at La Colorado,
you tell me there is an ancient trail that leads down to Llano, on the
Nechi river?""Yes, to the mouth of the Amaceri.Llano was something of a town long
ago.But river steamers that go up the Nechi as far as Zaragoza once a
month, or less frequently, still touch there, I am told.And so you
can get down the Cauca to Maganguey, where you can change to a
Magdalena river boat for Calamar.The trail
to Llano can not be more than fifty miles in length, and fairly
open."Harris, who had been studying the sketches, whistled softly.he muttered, "nearly two hundred miles, and all by foot, over
unspeakable jungle trails!""Very well, then," he continued, "we
had best set out as soon as possible.To you, friend Rosendo, I leave
all arrangements regarding supplies and _cargadores_.I will furnish
funds for the entire expedition, expecting to be reimbursed by La
Libertad."Carmen listened, with dilated eyes.Starting hurriedly after Rosendo, who rose immediately to inaugurate
preparations, he drew him into the latter's house.he
cried, his whole frame tremulous with agitation, "do you know what you
are doing?Do you--"

"_Na_, Padre," replied Rosendo gently, as he held up a restraining
hand, "it is best.I want the _Americanos_ to take Carmen.At any moment an order might come for your arrest or
mine.The struggle has been long, and I weary of it."He sat down in
exhaustion and mopped his damp brow.If I can but know that she is safe--_Bien_, that is all.From what we
have learned, this country will soon be plunged again into war.I do
not wish to live through another revolution.I seem
to have fought all my life.I doubt
if I could even hold it, were it known here that I had the title to
such a famous mine.But the _Americano_ can hold it.He will save Carmen's interest, and deal fairly with her._Bien_, let him place her in a school in the States.If you weather
the oncoming revolution, then you may be able to send for her."Rosendo," he said, "I will go with her.""Do you mean, Padre, that you
will leave the Church?""Can I remain longer in Simiti, where the people have become
divided--where they look upon me askance, as the cause of the trouble
that has befallen them?What, think you, will it mean to Simiti?And Wenceslas,
what has he further in store for you and me?What he has for Carmen,
we well know.But the disappearance
of Diego has not been explained.The trick which Anita played upon
Morales to save Carmen must bring down increased wrath upon our heads,
especially yours and mine.No, Rosendo, you and I must go, and go at
once!""We will pick her up in Cartagena.I have certain information to give him that will enlist his
services--information which, I think, will serve to introduce him
to His Grace, and somewhat abruptly.But, come, Rosendo, do you and
Dona Maria prepare for flight!"I will go with
the _Americanos_ up the Boque and to La Libertad.Then I will return
to Simiti--or to the _hacienda_ of Don Nicolas, if Maria wishes to
remain there while I am in the hills.But--do you go, Padre--go and
look after the girl.Yes,
Padre, go--go!""But--ah, Rosendo, you will reconsider?The Americans will take us all
for that mine!"No, Padre," said the old man firmly, but in a voice heavy with
sadness.My work is done when I have
seen the girl safely out of this unhappy country.Carmen came bounding in and flew into Rosendo's arms.she cried, aglow with animation, "we are all going to the States up
north!Oh, padre, isn't it beautiful!""Ah, _chiquita_," said Rosendo cheerily, straining her to him, "I
guess we have decided to send you on ahead--a little ahead of us.Your
old padre has some business he must attend to here before he leaves."Jose knew what his effort at cheerfulness was
costing him."But, padre Rosendo, you will come--later?She
looked into his eyes, pleading wistfully."Yes, little one, yes--of course.For where you are, there your old
padre will always be--always--always!"panted the girl under Rosendo's tight grasp as she
turned her head toward the priest."He goes with us," assured Rosendo--"I think--at least as far as the
coast.He will see Anita--and--" His voice broke, and he turned
abruptly away."And she will go to the States with us!cried the girl,
bounding up and down with joy.Jose turned and went quickly into his own house.With grim determination
he drew the battered haircloth trunk from beneath his bed and began
to throw his few effects into it.But he had scarce begun when Juan, now bearing the proud title of
official courier between Simiti and Bodega Central, entered with a
letter.Jose recognized the writing, and tore it open at once."My beloved son, at last, after these many years of most rigid
economy, even of privation, I have saved enough from my meager income,
together with what little you have been able to send me from time to
time, and a recent generous contribution from your dear uncle, to
enable me to visit you.I shall sail for Colombia just as soon as you
send me detailed instructions regarding the journey.And, oh, my son,
to see you offering the Mass in your own church, and to realize that
your long delayed preferment is even at hand, for so your good uncle
informs me daily, will again warm the blood in a heart long chilled by
poignant suffering.Till we meet, the Blessed Virgin shield you, my
beloved son."The letter slipped from the priest's fingers and drifted to the floor.With a moan he sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.CHAPTER 36


What had kept Jose de Rincon chained all these years to an institution
to which in thought, feeling, and sympathy he was so utterly alien, we
have repeatedly pointed out--a warped sense of filial devotion, a
devotion that would not willingly bring sorrow upon his proud,
sensitive mother, and yet the kind that so often accomplishes just
that which it strives to avoid.But yet he had somehow failed to note
the nice distinction which he was always making between the promises
he had given to her and the oath which he had taken at his ordination.He had permitted himself to be held to the Church by his mother's fond
desires, despite the fact that his nominal observance of these had
wrecked his own life and all but brought her in sorrow to the grave.The abundance of his misery might be traced to forgetfulness of the
sapient words of Jesus: "For whosoever shall do the will of my Father
which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."And he had sacrificed his new-found life to the
child.He had exhausted every expedient to keep himself in Simiti,
that he might transfer his own great learning to this girl, and at the
same time yield himself to her beneficent influence.Yet, despite his
vague hopes, he had always dimly seen the day when she would leave
him; but he had likewise tried to feel that when it arrived his own
status would be such that the ecclesiastical ties which bound him
would be loosened, and he would be free to follow her.the lapse
of years had brought little change in that respect.But now he saw the girl entering upon that very hour of departure
which all his life in Simiti had hung like a menacing cloud above
him.And the shock had been such that he had thrown every other
consideration to the winds, and, regardless of consequences, was madly
preparing to accompany her.Then, like a voice from the tomb, had come
his mother's letter.Indeed, for the past two nights sleep had
avoided his haggard eyes.In the feeble glow of his candle he sat in
his little bedroom by his rough, bare table, far into the hours of
morning, struggling, resolving, hoping, despairing--and, at last,
yielding.If he had been born anew that fateful day, seven years
before, when Rosendo first told him the girl's story, he had this
night again died.When the gray hours of dawn stole silently across
the distant hills he rose.He staggered as he passed out through the living room where
lay the sleeping Americans.Rosendo met him in front of the house.exclaimed the old man as he noted the priest's appearance."Do not speak of it, Rosendo."It has been hard on you, Padre.And in the States with her--"

"For God's sake, friend, never speak of that again!"How long will it take to complete your preparations?""_Bien_," returned the amazed Rosendo when he recovered his breath,
"we can get away to-morrow."But you--"

"Hear me, friend.Everything must be conducted in the greatest
secrecy.It must be given out that the Americans go to explore the
Boque; that you accompany them as guide; that Carmen goes as--as cook,
why not?""_Cierto_, she cooks as well as Maria."Juan must be kept in complete ignorance of the real nature
of your trip.He is the courier--I will see
that Fernando sends him again to Bodega Central to-morrow, and keeps
him there for several days.You say it is some two hundred miles to
Llano.How long will it take to go that distance?""Why--_Quien sabe_, Padre?""With a
fair trail, and allowing the _Americanos_ some time to prospect on the
Boque--where they will find nothing--and several days to look over La
Libertad, we ought to reach Llano in six weeks.""A week later, if you do not have to wait a month on the river bank
for the boat.""Then, all going well, within two months Carmen should be out of the
country."You and she--"

"Enough, friend."Go now and bid Carmen come to me immediately after the _desayuno_.Tell Dona Maria that I will eat nothing this morning.I am going up to
the old church on the hill."But Jose turned abruptly and
started away, leaving the old man in a maze of bewilderment.In the gloom of the old church Jose threw himself upon a bench near
the door, and waited torpidly.A few moments later came a voice, and
then the soft patter of bare feet in the thick dust without.Carmen
was talking as she approached.Jose rose in curiosity; but the girl
was alone.In her hand she held a scrubby flower that had drawn a
desperate nourishment from the barren soil at the roadside.She
glanced up at Jose and smiled."It is easy to understand their language, isn't it, Padre?They don't
speak as we do, but they reflect.They stand for His ideas in the human mind.And I. Aren't they wonderful, these flowers!But you know,
they are only the way we interpret certain of God's wonderful ideas.Only, because we mortals believe in death, we see these beautiful
things at last reflecting our thought of death--don't we?We see only
our thoughts, after all.Everything we see about us is reflected
thought.First we see our thoughts of life and beauty and good.And
then our thoughts of decay and death."But God--He never sees anything but the good," she went on."He sees
the real, not the supposition.And when we learn to see only as He
does, why, then we will never again see death.We will see ourselves
as we really are, immortal.Jesus learned
to see that way, didn't he?His thought was finally so pure that he
saw nothing but good.And that gave him such power that he did those
things that the poor, ignorant, wrong-thinking people called miracles.But they were only the things that you and I and everybody else ought
to be doing to-day--and would be doing, if we thought as he did,
instead of thinking of evil."But," she panted, as she sat down beside him, "I've talked a lot,
haven't I?And you sent for me because you wanted to talk.But,
remember," holding up an admonitory finger, "I shall not listen if you
talk anything but good.Oh, Padre dear," looking up wistfully into his
drawn face, "you are still thinking that two and two are seven!How can you ever expect to see good if
you look only at evil?If I looked only at wilted flowers I would
never know there were any others.""Carmen," he said in a hollow voice, "I love you.""Why, of course you do," returned the artless girl.You have just _got_ to love me and everything and everybody.But it had been floating like foam on
his tossing mind."You are going away from me," he continued, almost in a whisper."Why, no, Padre," she replied quickly; "you are going too!Padre
Rosendo said we could start to-morrow at sunrise.""I do not go," he said in a quavering voice.What meant this change which had
come over him so suddenly?His mother's face hovered before him in the dim light.Behind her
a mitered head, symbolizing the Church, nodded and beckoned
significantly.Back of them, as they stood between him and the
girl, he saw the glorified vision of Carmen.He
turned wearily from it to the gentle presence at his side."I stay--to work out--my problem," was his scarcely audible reply.But her breath came more quickly, and her hand
closed more tightly about his."Dearest one," he murmured, bending over the brown curls, "it is God's
way, I guess.Perhaps in the years which I have spent here with you I
have had the time and the opportunity to work out my salvation.But, though I strove in my way, I could not quickly
acquire your spirituality.I could not at once shake loose those
poisonous thoughts of a lifetime, which have at last become
externalized in separation from all that I hold dearest in this life,
you, my beloved girl, you."He buried his face in her luxuriant hair
and strove to hold back the rush of scalding tears."It but shows how poisonous thoughts separate us from all that is
good--even from God," he continued in a choked voice."Oh, my sweet
girl, I love you as it seems to me no human being could love another!It has been so from that first day when, a mere babe, your wonderful
eyes held me until I could read in them a depth of love for mankind
that was divine."It did not seem to him that a mature man was
speaking to a mere girl.She seemed, as always, ages beyond him in
wisdom and experience.Carmen reached up and wound her arms about his neck.He bent low and
kissed her brow.Then he drew himself up quickly and resumed his
broken talk."I believed at first that my salvation lay in you.And so it did, for
from your clear thought I gleaned my first satisfying knowledge of the
great principle, God.I could not seem to realize that
between recognizing righteousness as 'right-thinking' and daily
practicing it so as to 'prove' God there was a great difference.And
so I rested easy in my first gleams of truth, expecting that they
would so warm my soul that it would expand of itself out of all
error."She made as if to reply, but he checked her."I learned enough, I repeat, those first few months here to have
enabled me to work out my salvation, even though with fear and
trembling.But I procrastinated; I vacillated; I still clung to
effete beliefs and forms of thought which I knew were bound to
manifest in unhappiness later.I was afraid to boldly throw myself
upon my thought.Yes, the great Paul was at times
under the same mesmeric spell of human belief, even after he had seen
the vision of the Christ.And now
I see that I must do likewise, for salvation is an individual
experience.No vicarious effort, even of the Christ himself, can save
a man.We must apply it to our
problems ourselves.My unfinished task--scarcely even begun!--lies
still before me.My environment is what I have made it by my own
thought.I believe you, that I can enter another only as I externalize
it through righteousness, right-thinking, and 'proving' God."He paused and bent over the silent little figure nestling so quietly
at his side."You, Carmen, though but a child in years, have risen beyond me, and
beyond this lowly encompassment.Why, when you were a mere babe, you
should have grasped your padre Rosendo's casual statement that 'God is
everywhere,' and shaped your life to accord with it, I do not know.That must remain one of the hidden mysteries of God.But
the fact stands that you did grasp it, and that with it as a light
unto your feet you groped your way out of this environment, avoiding
all pitfalls and evil snares, until to-day you stand at the threshold
of another and higher one.So progress must ever be, I now realize.Up
we must rise from one plane of human mentality to another, sifting and
sorting the thoughts that come to us, clinging to these, discarding
those, until, even as you have said, we learn at last instantly to
accept those that mirror forth God, infinite, divine mind, and to
reject those that bear the stamp of supposition.""Padre," the girl said, lifting her beautiful face to his, "I have
told you so often--when a thought comes to me that I think is not from
God, or does not reflect Him, I turn right on it and kill it.You
could do the same, if you would.""Assuredly, child--if I would!"And then the millennium would be with us, and the
kingdom of heaven revealed.The mesmeric belief in evil as an entity
and a power opposed to good alone prevents that.Destroy this belief,
and the curtain will instantly rise on eternity."His eyes struggled with hers, as he gazed long and wistfully into
them.Lost in his impassioned speech, he had for the moment seemed to
be translated.Then a surge of fear-thoughts swept him, and left him
dwelling on the hazardous journey that awaited her.He wildly clutched
her again to his side."Carmen--child--how can I let you go!And that
awful journey--two hundred miles of unknown jungle, to the far-off
Nechi!And then the burning river, to Cartagena, where--where _he_ is!And the States--God, what awaits you there!""Padre," she answered softly, "I shall not go unless it is right.If
it is right, then God will take care of me--and of you."Again she saw only the "right-best" thought, while he sat trembling
before its opposite.And the opposite was as yet a supposition!"Padre dear, there is no separation, you know.God is everywhere, and
so there is no separation from good--is there?""Not in your thought, dearest child," he murmured huskily."Well, Padre dear, I am still with you, am I not?Can't you live one
day at a time?You are borrowing from
to-morrow, and you have no right to do it.God says,
'Thou shalt not steal,' even from to-morrow."The thought seemed to
lighten his load momentarily."You have been thinking so many bad thoughts of late--I don't suppose
you have had any good thoughts at all about Anita's little babe?"You promised me that every day you
would just _know_ that."Aye, his crowning sin was revealed again in
all its ugly nakedness.His thought was always of his own
troubles, his own longings, his own fears.Self-centeredness had left
no room for thoughts of Ana's blind babe.And why was he now straining
this beautiful girl to himself?Was it fear for her, or for himself?Yet she gave but little heed to her own needs.Always her concern was
for others, others who stumbled and drooped because of the human
mind's false, unreal, undemonstrable beliefs and ignorance of the
allness of God."Ah, child," he exclaimed penitently, "such love!How could I dare to
hope ever to claim it!"Why, Padre, I love the real 'you,' the 'you' that is going to be
brought out, and that will become more and more clear, until at last
it stands as the perfect reflection of God.Haven't I told you that,
time and time again?"But--to live with me--to be my--"

"Well, Padre, if we were not still human we would not be thinking that
we were on earth.We have got to work out of this human way of
thinking and living.And it has seemed to me that you and I could work
out of it so much better together, you helping me, manifesting God's
protection and care, and I helping you, as you say I can and do.And
how can we live together and work together unless we marry?He would not try to explain her reasoning, her contempt for
convention.As for him, women had never
constituted a temptation.He knew that he loved this simple, ingenuous
girl with a tenderness of passion that was wholly free from the dross
of mesmerism."Padre, if you think you must stay here for a little while, to work
out your problem, why, I shall just _know_ that evil can not separate
us.I don't like to even seem to go away without you.But--it will be
only seeming, after all, won't it?God's children can not really be
separated--never!"She was still paying faithful tribute to her vision of the spiritual
universe.How like a benison they
flowed over his drooping spirits!"And now, Padre dear," she said, rising from the bench,--"we have done
all we could--left everything with God--haven't we?I must go now, for
madre Maria told me to come back soon.Sing
again the sweet melody that I heard when I awoke from the fever that
day long ago!"Nestling close against him, her
head resting on his shoulder and her hand in his, she sang again the
song that had seemed to lift him that distant day far, far above the
pitiful longings and strivings of poor humanity, even unto the gates
of the city of eternal harmony.She finished, and the last clear, sweet note echoed through the musty
room and died among the black rafters overhead.A holy silence fell
upon them as they sat, hand in hand, facing the future.Hot tears were
streaming down the man's cheeks.They fell sparkling like drops of
dew upon her brown curls.The girl, obedient
to the vision, was reaping her reward.He, timid, wavering, doubting,
was left, still pecking at the shell of his dreary environment.It was
but the working of the infinite law of cause and effect.But did he
imagine that out in the world she would not still find tribulation,
even as the Saviour had said?But she
leaned on her sustaining God.She had already passed through such fiery trials that
he knew no contrary belief in evil now could weaken or counterbalance
her supreme confidence in immanent good."If I have to go and leave you, will you promise me that you will act
your knowledge of the Christ-principle and work out your problem, so
that you may come to me soon?"The tug at his heartstrings brought a moan to his lips."And--you will keep your promise about Anita's babe?"She rose and, still holding his hand, led him down the hill and to
Rosendo's house.Throughout the remainder of that feverishly busy day the priest clung
to the girl like a shadow.They talked together but little, for she
was in constant demand to help her foster-mother in the preparations
for the long journey.Again and again
he would seize her hand and press it to his burning lips.Again and
again he would stroke her soft hair, or stretch out his hand to touch
her dress as she passed him.Always when she glanced up at him the
same sweet, compassionate smile glowed on her face.When she left the
house, he followed.When she bent over the ash-strewn fireplace, or
washed the few plain dishes, he sought to share her employment; and,
when gently, lovingly repulsed, sat dully, with his yearning eyes
riveted upon her.Rosendo saw him, and forgot his own sorrow in pity
for the suffering priest.The preparations carried the toilers far into the night.But at length
the last bundle was strapped to its _siete_, the last plan discussed
and agreed upon, and the two Americans had thrown themselves upon
their cots for a brief rest before dawn.Rosendo took Jose aside,
while Dona Maria and Carmen sought their beds."Fernando sends Juan to Bodega Central at daybreak," the old man said.Maria remains
here with you until I return.Then we may go to the _hacienda_ of Don
Nicolas, on the Boque.I shall tell him to have it in readiness on my
return.I shall probably not get back to Simiti for two months.If, as
you say, you still think best not to go with the Americans and the
girl, what will you do here?Some say
they intend to ask the Bishop to remove you._Bien_, will you not
decide to go?"He shook his head, and waved
Rosendo away.Then, taking a chair, he went into the sleeping room and
sat down at the bedside of the slumbering girl.Reaching over, he took
her hand.What was it that she had said to him that day, long gone, when Diego
claimed her as his child?Ah, yes:

"Don't feel badly, Padre dear.His thoughts have only the minus
sign--and that means nothing, you know."And later, many weeks later:

"Padre, you can not think wrong and right thoughts together, you know.You can not be happy and unhappy at the same time.You can not be sick
and well together."In other words, the wise little maid was trying to
show him that Paul spoke directly to such as he when he wrote: Know ye
not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants
ye are--?"You can not have both good and evil, Padre," she had so often
insisted."You must want good--want it more than anything else.And
then you must prepare for it by thinking right thoughts and unthinking
wrong ones.And as you prepare for good, you must _know_ that it is
coming.But you must not say how it shall come, nor what it shall look
like.You must not say that it shall be just as you may think you
would like to have it."You see, Padre dear"--oh, how the memory of her words smote him
now!--"you see, the good Jesus told the people to clean their
window-panes and let in the light--good thoughts--for then these would
be externalized in health, happiness, and all good, instead of the
old, bad thoughts being externalized longer in sickness and evil.He saw that the Christ-idea found expression and
reflection in the pure mentality of this girl.He saw that that
mentality was unsullied, uneducated in the lore of human belief, and
untrained to fear.He saw that the resurrection of the Christ, for
which a yearning world waits, was but the rising of the Christ-idea
in the human mentality.And he saw, too, that ere the radiant
resurrection morn can arrive there must be the crucifixion, a
world-wide crucifixion of human, carnal thought.But will ye not learn that following him means _thinking_
as he did?But Jose had tried to think aright during those years in Simiti.True,
but the efforts had been spasmodic.From childhood he had passed
through doubt, fear, scepticism, and final agnosticism.Then he had
started anew and aright.And then had come the "day of judgment," the
recurrent hours of sore trial--and he had not stood.Called upon to
prove God, to prove the validity of his splendid deductions, he had
vacillated between the opposing claims of good and evil, and had
floundered helplessly.And now he stood confronting his still unsolved
problem, realizing as never before that in the solving of it he must
unlearn the intellectual habits of a lifetime.There were other problems which lay still unsolved before him as he
sat there that night.The sable veil of mystery which hung about
Carmen's birth had never been penetrated, even slightly.What woman's
face was that which looked out so sadly from the little locket?"Dolores"--sorrowful, indeed!What tragedy had those great, mournful
eyes witnessed?He used to
think so, but not of late.Did she, he wondered, resemble the man?And
had the mother's kisses and hot tears blurred the portrait beneath
which he had so often read the single inscription, "Guillermo"?If so,
could not the portrait be cleaned?But Jose himself had not dared
attempt it.Perhaps some day that could be done by one skilled in such
art.And did Carmen inherit any of her unique traits from either of her
parents?Her voice, her religious instinct, her keen mentality--whence
came they?"From God," the girl would always answer whenever he voiced
the query in her presence.And Jose found himself sitting beside the
sleeping girl and dumbly yielding to the separation which now had
come.And, if he must live and
solve his problem, could he stand after she had left?He bent closer
to her, and listened to the gentle breathing.He seemed again to see
her, as he was wont in the years past, flitting about her diminutive
rose garden and calling to him to come and share her boundless joy."Come, Padre dear, and see my beautiful
thoughts!"And then, so often, "Oh, Padre!"bounding into his arms,
"here is a beautiful thought that came to me to-day, and I caught it
and wouldn't let it go!"Lonely, isolated child, having nothing in
common with the children of her native heath, yet dwelling ever in a
world peopled with immaculate concepts!He thought of the day when he had
approached Rosendo with his great question."Rosendo," he had said in
deep earnestness, "where, oh, where did Carmen get these ideas?"No, Padre," Rosendo had replied gravely."When she was a little
thing, just learning to talk, she often asked about God.And one day I
told her that God was everywhere--what else could I say?_Bien_, a
strange light came into her eyes.And after that, Padre, she talked
continually about Him, and to Him.And she seemed to know Him well--so
well that she saw Him in every thing and every place.Padre, it is
very strange--very strange!"No, it was not strange, Jose had thought, but beautifully natural.And
later, when he came to teach her, his constant endeavor had been to
impart his secular knowledge to the girl without endangering her
marvelous faith in her immanent God.In that he had succeeded, for in
that there had been no obstructing thoughts of self to overcome.And now--

"For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will
I gather thee--"

The night shadows fled.Jose still sat at the girl's
bedside, dumb and motionless.Carmen awoke, and threw her arms about
him.But Rosendo appeared and hurried her out to the light morning
repast, for they must lose no time in starting.By ten o'clock the savannas would be too hot to cross, and
they lay some distance from Simiti.Reed and Harris were bustling
about, assembling the packers and cracking jokes as they strapped the
chairs to the men's backs.Dona Maria's eyes were red with weeping,
but she kept silence.Don Jorge
grimly packed his own kit and prepared to set out for the Magdalena,
for he had suddenly announced his determination not to accompany
Rosendo and his party, but to go back and consult with Don Carlos
Norosi in regard to the future.At last Rosendo's voice rang out in a great shout:

"_Ya esta!"_

"Bully-bueno!"The _cargadores_ moved forward in the direction of the Boque trail.The Americans, with a final _adios_ to Dona Maria and the priest,
swung into line behind them.Rosendo again tenderly embraced his
weeping spouse, and then, turned to Jose."The Virgin watch over you and Maria, Padre!If the war comes, flee with her to the Boque."He threw an arm about the priest and kissed him on both cheeks.Then,
calling to Carmen, he turned and started after the others."Padre," she murmured, clinging to him and showering him with kisses,
"I love you, love you, love you!You
will come--or I will come back to you.And I will work for you every
day.I will know that you are God's child, and that you will solve
your problem!"Rosendo, half way down the road, turned and called sharply to her.But again she stopped, turned around, and flew
back to Jose, as he knelt in the dust and, with tongue cleaving to his
mouth, held out his trembling arms."Padre, dearest, dearest Padre," she sobbed, "I love you, I love you!And--I had forgotten--this--it is for you to read every day--every
day!"Again she tore herself
away and ran after the impatient Rosendo.In a moment they were out of
sight.A groan of anguish escaped the stricken priest.He rose from his knees
and followed stumbling after the girl.As he reached the shales he saw
her far in the distance at the mouth of the trail.She turned, and
waved her hand to him.Then the dark trail swallowed her, and he saw
her no more.For a moment he stood like a statue, striving with futile gaze to
penetrate that black opening in the dense bush that had engulfed his
very soul.His hand
closed convulsively over the paper which the girl had left with him.Mechanically he opened it and read:

  "Dearest, dearest Padre, these four little Bible verses I leave
  with you; and you will promise your little girl that you will
  always live by them.Thou shall have no other gods before me.Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
  heaven is perfect.Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."And, Padre, my dearest, dearest Padre, _God is everywhere_."His brain reeled, and he swayed like a drunken man.He
turned about, muttering incoherently.Tenderly taking his arm, she led him back to the forlorn little house.Its ghastly emptiness smote him until his reason tottered.He sank
into a chair and gazed with dull, stony eyes out over the placid
lake, where the white beams of the rising sun were breaking into
myriad colors against the brume.CHAPTER 37


The two hundred miles which lay before Rosendo and his little band
stretched their rugged, forbidding length through ragged canons,
rushing waters, and dank, virginal forest.Only the old man, as he
trudged along the worn trail between Simiti and the Inanea river,
where canoes waited to transport the travelers to the little village
of Boque, had any adequate conception of what the journey meant.Even
the _cargadores_ were unfamiliar with the region which they were to
penetrate.Some of them had been over the Guamoco trail as far as
Culata; a few had ascended the Boque river to its farthest navigable
point.But none had penetrated the inmost reaches of the great canon
through which the headwaters tumbled and roared, and none had ever
dreamed of making the passage over the great divide, the _Barra
Principal_, to the Tigui beyond.To the Americans, fresh from the luxury and convention of city life,
and imbued with the indomitable Yankee spirit of adventure, the
prospect was absorbing in its allurements.Especially to the
excitable, high-strung Harris, whose great eyes almost popped from his
head at the continuous display of tropical marvels, and whose
exclamations of astonishment and surprise, enriched from his
inexhaustible store of American slang and miner's parlance, burst from
his gaping mouth at every turn of the sinuous trail.From the outset,
he had constituted himself Carmen's special protector, although
much to Rosendo's consternation, for the lank, awkward fellow, whose
lean shoulders bent under the weight of some six-feet-two of
height, went stumbling and tripping along the way, swaying against
every tree and bush that edged the path, and constantly giving noisy
vent to his opinions regarding trails in general, and those of the
tropics in particular.His only accouterment was a Winchester
rifle of tremendous bore, which he insisted on carrying in constant
readiness to meet either beasts of prey or savage Indians, but
which, in his absent-mindedness and dreamy preoccupation, he
either dragged, muzzle up, or carried at such dangerous angles that
the natives were finally obliged, in self-protection, to insist
that he hand the weapon over to Rosendo.To Carmen, as the days
passed and she gradually recognized his sterling qualities, he
became a source of delight.Hour after hour she trotted along after
him, chatting merrily in her beloved English tongue, poking fun at
his awkwardness, and laughing boisterously over his quaint slang and
naive Yankee expressions.She had never heard such things from Jose;
nor had the priest, despite his profound knowledge, ever told her
such exciting tales as did Harris, when he drew from his store of
frontier memories and  his narratives with the rich tints
furnished by his easy imagination.The first day out had been one of mental struggle for the girl.She
had turned into the trail, after waving a last farewell to Jose, with
a feeling that she had never experienced before.For hours she trudged
along, oblivious of her environment, murmuring, "It isn't true--it
isn't true!"until Harris, his curiosity aroused by the constant
repetition which floated now and then to his ears, demanded to know
what it was that was so radically false."It isn't true that we can be separated," she answered, looking at him
with moist eyes."Yes, God's children--people--people--who--love each other," she
replied.Then she dropped her eyes in evident embarrassment, and
refused to discuss the topic further.ejaculated Harris, pondering the cryptical remark, "you
surely are a queer little dud!"But the girl turned from him to Rosendo.Nor would
she permit the old man to leave her until, late that night, exhausted
by the excitement of the day, she dropped asleep in the house of Don
Nicolas, on the muddy margin of the river Boque, still clinging to
Rosendo's hand.Despite the protestations of Don Nicolas and the pleading of the
_cargadores_, Rosendo stolidly refused to spend a day at Boque.They were still within reach of
the federal authorities.He dared not rest until the jungle had
swallowed them."Ah, _compadre_," said Don Nicolas, in disappointment, "I would like
much for you to enjoy my house while it is still clean.they swarmed down upon us but a day ago.They came out of the bush in millions, straight for the house.had we remained, we should have been eaten alive.But
they swept the house--_Hombre_!no human hands could have done so
well.Every spider, every rat, beetle, flea, every plague, was
instantly eaten, and within a half hour they had disappeared again,
and we moved back into a thoroughly cleaned house!"Harris stood with mouth agape in mute astonishment when Carmen, whom
he had constituted his interpreter, translated to him the story.That evening, after they had eaten out in the open before the house,
and the Americans had tickled the palates of the villagers with some
tinned beef of uncertain quality, Don Nicolas approached Reed."Senor," he said, "my mother, now very aged, is sick, and we think she
can not recover.But you Americanos are wonderfully skilled, and your
medicines powerful.Have you not some remedy in your pack that will
alleviate the good woman's sufferings?Reed knew how great was the faith of these simple people in the wisdom
of the American, and he had reason to wish to preserve it.But he had
come into that country illy prepared to cope with disease, and his
medical equipment contained nothing but quinine.He reflected a
moment, then turned to Harris."Did you smuggle any of your beloved root-beer extract into the
equipment?"Harris looked sheepish, but returned a sullen affirmative."Well," continued Reed, "dig out a bottle and we'll fix up a dose of
pain-killer for our worthy host's mother.""Cierto, senor," he said with an air of
confidence."I have a remedy which I know to be unfailing for any
disease."He disappeared into the house, from which he emerged again in a few
moments with an empty cola bottle.Washing this clean in the river, he
partly filled it with water.Then he poured in the small bottle of
root-beer extract which Harris handed him, and added a few grains of
quinine.Shaking the mixture thoroughly, he carried it to Don
Nicolas."Be very careful, senor," he admonished, giving him the bottle."It is
a medicine extremely powerful and immediate in its action.Give the
senora a small teaspoonful every hour.By morning you will notice a
marked change."Don Nicolas's eyes lighted with joy, and his gratitude poured forth in
extravagant expressions.With the first indications of approaching day Rosendo was abroad,
rounding up his cargadores, who were already bickering as to their
respective duties, and arranging the luggage in the canoes for the
river trip.Additional boats and men had been secured; and Don Nicolas
himself expressed his intention of accompanying them as far as his
hacienda, Maria Rosa, a day's journey up-stream."It was there that I hid during the last revolution," he said, "when
the soldiers burned the village and cut off the ears and fingers of
our women for their rings.Ah, senores, you can not know how we
suffered!All my goods stolen or burned--my family scattered--my
_finca_ destroyed!We lived two years at Maria Rosa, not daring to
come down the river again.His eyes burned fiercely as he spoke, and his hands opened
and closed convulsively.He was a representative of that large class
of _rurales_ upon whom the heaviest burdens, the greatest suffering,
and the most poignant sorrow attending a political revolution always
fall.he exclaimed, suddenly turning to Reed, "I had all but
forgotten!She would see the kind
American whose remedies are so wonderful.For, senor, she rose from
her bed this morning restored!And you must leave us another bottle of
the remedy--at whatever price, senor!"Reed gazed at the man uncomprehendingly, until at length the truth
dawned upon him.His root-beer remedy had done its work!Then a broad
grin mantled his face; but he quickly suppressed it and went with Don
Nicolas to receive in person his patient's effusive thanks.When he
returned and took his place in the waiting boat, he shook his head."It's past all understanding," he muttered to Harris, "what faith will
do!I can believe now that it will remove mountains."Throughout the long, interminably long, hot day the perspiring men
poled and paddled, urged and teased, waded and pushed against the
increasing current, until, as the shadows began to close around them,
they sighted the scarcely visible opening in the bush which marked the
trail to the _hacienda_ of Maria Rosa.It was a desperately lonely
clearing on the verge of the jungle; but there were two thatch-covered
sheds, and to the exhausted travelers it gave assurance of rest and
protection.Before they made the landing Rosendo's sharp eyes had
spied a large ant-eater and her cub, moving sluggishly through the
bush; and Reed's quick shots had brought them both down.The men's
eyes dilated when the animals were dragged into the canoes.It meant
fresh meat instead of salt _bagre_ for at least two days.Early next morning the travelers bade farewell to Don Nicolas and set
their course again up-stream.They would now see no human being other
than the members of their own little party until they reached Llano,
on the distant Nechi."Remember," called Don Nicolas, as the canoes drifted out into the
stream, "the _quebrada_ of Caracoli is the third on the right.An old
trail used to lead from there across to the Tiguicito--but I doubt if
you find even a trace of it now.There is no water between that point
and the Tiguicito._Conque, adios, senores, adios_!"The hallooing of farewells echoed along the river and died away in the
dark forest on either hand.Harris and Reed settled back in their
canoe and yielded to the fascination of the slowly shifting scene.Carmen chose to occupy the same canoe with them, and perforce Rosendo
acted as _patron_.Between his knees
Reed held the rifle upright, in readiness for any animal whose
curiosity might bring it to the water's edge to view the rare pageant
passing through that unbroken solitude.The river was now narrowing, and there were often rapids whose ascent
necessitated disembarking from the canoes, while the _bogas_ strained
and teased the lumbering dugouts up over them.In places the stream
was choked by fallen trees and tangled driftwood, until only a narrow,
tortuous opening was left, through which the waters raced like a
mill-course, making a heavy draft on the intuitive skill of the
_bogas_.Often slender islets rose from the river; and then heated,
chattering, often acrimonious discussions ensued among the men as to
the proper channel to take.Always on either side rose the matted,
tangled, impenetrable forest wall of dense bush and giant trees, from
which innumerable trailers and _bejuco_ vines dropped into the waters
beneath.From the surface of the river to the tops of the great trees,
often two hundred feet above, hung a drapery of creeping plants, of
parasitical growths, and diversified foliage, of the most vivid shades
of green, inextricably laced and interwoven, and dotted here and there
with orchideous flowers and strange blossoms, while in the tempered
sunlight which sifted through it sported gorgeous insects and
butterflies of enormous size and exquisite shades, striped and spotted
in orange, blue, and vivid red.Scarcely a hand's breadth of the
jungle wall but contained some strange, eerie animal or vegetable form
that brought expressions of wonder and astonishment from the
enraptured Americans.At times, too, there were grim tragedies being
enacted before them.In one spot a huge, hairy spider, whose delicate,
lace-like web hung to the water's edge, was viciously wrapping its
silken thread about a tiny bird that had become entangled.Again, a
shriek from beyond the river's margin told of some careless monkey or
small animal that had fallen prey to a hungry jaguar.Above the
travelers all the day swung the ubiquitous buzzards, with their
watchful, speculative eyes ever on the slowly moving cavalcade.If her thought reverted at all to the priest,
she gave no hint of it.But once, leaning back and gazing off into
the opalescent sky overhead, she murmured: "And to think, it is only
the way the human mind translates God's ideas!And some day I shall see those ideas, instead of the mortal mind's
interpretations of them!"Harris heard her, and asked her to repeat her comments in English."You would not understand," she said simply.And no
badinage on his part could further influence her.Rosendo, inscrutable and silent, showed plainly the weight of
responsibility which he felt.Only twice that day did he emerge from
the deep reserve into which he had retired; once when, in the far
distance, his keen eye espied a small deer, drinking at the water's
edge, but which, scenting the travelers, fled into cover ere Reed
could bring the rifle to his shoulders; and again, when they were upon
a jaguar almost before either they or the astonished animal realized
it.In the tempered rays of the late afternoon sun the flower-bespangled
walls of the forest became alive with gaily painted birds and insects.Troops of chattering monkeys awoke from their midday _siesta_ and
scampered noisily through the treetops over the aerial highways
formed by the liana vines, whose great bush-ropes, often a foot and
more in thickness, stretched their winding length long distances
through the forest, and bound the vegetation together in an
intricate, impenetrable network.Yellow and purple blossoms, in a
riot of ineffable splendor, bedecked the lofty trees and tangled
parasitical creepers that wrapped around them, constituting
veritable hanging gardens.Great palms, fattened by the almost
incessant rains in this hot-house of Nature, rose in the spaces
unoccupied by the buttressed roots of the forest giants.Splendidly
tailored kingfishers swooped over the water, scarce a foot above its
surface.Quarreling parrots and nagging macaws screamed their
inarticulate message to the travelers.Tiny forest gems, the
infinitely variegated _colibri_, whirred across the stream and
followed its margins until attracted by the gorgeous pendent flowers.On the _playas_ in the hazy distance ahead the travelers could often
distinguish tall, solemn cranes, dancing their grotesque measures, or
standing on one leg and dreaming away their little hour of life in
this terrestrial fairy-land.Darkness fell, almost with the swiftness of a snuffed candle.For an
hour Rosendo had been straining his eyes toward the right bank of the
river, and as he gazed his apprehension increased.But, as night
closed in, a soft murmur floated down to the cramped, toil-worn
travelers, and the old man, with a glad light in his eyes, announced
that they were approaching the _quebrada_ of Caracoli.A half hour
later, by the weird, flickering light of the candles which Reed and
Harris held out on either side, Rosendo turned the canoe into a
brawling stream, and ran its nose into the deep alluvial soil.Plunging fearlessly through the fringe of delicate ferns which lined
the margin of the creek, he cut a wide swath with his great _machete_
and uncovered a dim trail, which led to a ramshackle, thatch-covered
hut a few yards beyond.It was the tumbled vestige of a shelter which
Don Nicolas had erected years before while hunting wild pigs through
this trackless region.An hour later the little group lay asleep on
the damp ground, wrapped in the solitude of the great forest.The silvery haze of dawn was dimming the stars and deepening into
ruddier hues that tinged the fronds of the mighty trees as with
streaks of blood when Rosendo, like an implacable Nemesis, prodded his
little party into activity.Their first day's march through the
wilderness was to begin, and the old man moved with the nervous,
restless energy of a hunted jaguar.The light breakfast of coffee and
cold _arepa_ over, he dismissed the _bogas_, who were to return to
Boque with the canoes, and set about arranging the cargo in suitable
packs for the _cargadores_ who were to accompany him over the long
reaches of jungle that stretched between them and Llano.Two
_macheteros_ were sent on ahead of the main party to locate and open a
trail.Before the shimmering,
opalescent rays which overspread the eastern sky had begun to turn
downward, the little cavalcade, led by Rosendo, had taken the narrow,
newly-cut trail and plunged into the shadows of the forest--

  "the great, dim, mysterious forest, where uncertainty wavers to an
  interrogation point."CHAPTER 38


The emotion of the jungle is a direct function of human temperament.Where one sees in it naught but a "grim, green sepulcher," teeming with
malignant, destructive forces, inimical to health, to tranquillity, to
life, another--perhaps a member of the same party--will find in the
wanton extravagance of Nature, her prodigious luxury, her infinite
variety of form, of color, and sound, such stimuli to the imagination,
and such invitation to further discovery and development, as to
constitute a lure as insidious and unescapable as the habit which too
often follows the first draft of the opium's fumes.There are those
who profess to have journeyed through vast stretches of South
American _selva_ without encountering a wild animal.Others, with sight
and hearing keener, and with a sense of observation not dulled by
futile lamentations over the absence of the luxuries of civilized
travel, will uncover a wealth of experiences which feed the memory
throughout their remaining years, and mold an irresistible desire to
penetrate again those vast, teeming, baffling solitudes.It is true, the sterner aspect of the South American jungle
affords little invitation to repose or restful contemplation.And
the charm which its riotous prodigality exerts is in no sense
idyllic.For the jungle falls upon one with the force of a blow.It
grips by its massiveness, its awful grandeur.It does not entice
admiration, but exacts obeisance by brute force.Its rest is continuous motion, incessant activity.The
garniture of its trackless wastes is that of great daubs of vivid
color, laid thick upon the canvas with the knife--never modulated,
never worked into delicate shading with the brush, but attracting
by its riot, its audacity, its immensity, its disdain of convention,
its utter disregard of the canons cherished by the puny mind that
contemplates it.The forest's appeal is a reflex of its own infinite
complexity.The sensations which it arouses within the one who steps
from civilization into its very heart are myriad, and often
terrible.The instinct of self-preservation is by it suddenly,
rudely aroused and kept keenly alive.The roar of its howling monkeys strikes terror to the timid heart.The plaintive calls of its persecuted feathered denizens echo through
the mysterious vastnesses like despairing voices from a spirit
world.The crashing noises, the strange, weird, unaccountable
sounds that hurtle through its dimly lighted corridors blanch the
face and cause the hand to steal furtively toward the loosely
sheathed weapon.The piercing, frenzied screams which arise with
blood-curdling effect through the awful stillness of noonday or the
dead of night, turn the startled thought with sickening yearning
toward the soft charms of civilization, in which the sense of
protection is greater, even if actual security is frequently less.Because of Nature's utter disregard of the individual, life is
everywhere.And that life is sharply armed and on the defensive.Their droning murmur crowds the air.The trunks of trees, the
great, pendent leaves of plants, the trailing vines, slimy with dank
vegetation, afford footing and housing to countless myriads of
them, keenly alert, ferociously resistive.The decaying logs fester
with scorpions.Daniel went to the bathroom.The ground is cavernous with the burrows of
lizards and crawling forms, with centipedes and fierce formicidae.Where
one falls, countless others spring up to fill the gap.The rivers
and _pantanos_ yield their quota of variegated forms.The flat
_perania_, the dreaded electric eel, infests the warm streams, and
inflicts its torture without discrimination upon all who dare invade
its domain.Snakes lurk in the fetid swamps and lagoons, the
brilliant coral and the deadly _mapina_.Beneath the forest leaves
coils the brown adder, whose sting proves fatal within three days.To those who see only these aspects of the jungle, a journey such as
that undertaken by Rosendo and his intrepid little band would prove a
terrifying experience, a constant repetition of nerve-shocks, under
which the "centers" must ultimately give way.But to the two
Americans, fresh from the mining camps of the West, and attuned to any
pitch that Nature might strike in her marvelous symphony, the
experience was one to be taken in the same spirit as all else that
pertained to their romantic calling.Rosendo and his men accepted the
day's stint of toil and danger with dull stolidity.Carmen threw
herself upon her thought, and saw in her shifting environment only the
human mind's interpretation of its mixed concept of good and evil.The
insects swarmed around her as around the others.The tantalizing
_jejenes_ urged their insidious attacks upon her, as upon the rest.Her hands were dotted with tiny blood-blisters where the ravenous
gnats had fed.But she uttered no complaint; nor would she discuss the
matter when Harris proffered his sympathy, and showed his own red
hands."It isn't true," she would say."But you have no religion, and you
don't understand--as yet."Well, you have mighty
strange beliefs, young lady!""But not as strange and illogical as those you hold," she replied."Oh, I don't believe anything," he answered, with a shrug of his
shoulders."I'm an agnostic, you know.""There is just where you mistake, Mr."For, instead of not believing anything, you firmly believe in the
presence and power of evil.It is just those very people who boast
that they do not believe in anything who believe most thoroughly in
evil and its omnipotence and omnipresence."Yes, even the animals which she saw about her were but the human
mind's concepts of God's ideas--not real.In the
Bible allegory, or dream, the human, mortal mind names all its own
material concepts.From the rippling Tiguicito,
which they reached choking with thirst and utterly exhausted, they
dropped down again to the Boque, where they established camps and
began to prospect the Molino company's "near-mines," as Harris called
them after the first few unsuccessful attempts to get "colors" out of
the barren soil.At certain points, where there seemed a more likely
prospect, they remained for days, until the men, under Rosendo's
guidance, could sink pits to the underlying bedrock.Such work was
done with the crudest of tools--an iron bar, wooden scrapers in lieu
of shovels, and wooden _bateas_ in which the men handed the loosened
dirt up from one stage to another and out to the surface.It was slow,
torturing work.The food ran low, and they
complained.Then Harris one evening stumbled upon a tapir, just as the great
animal had forded the river and was shambling into the bush
opposite.It fell
with a broken hip, and the men finished it with their _machetes_.Its hide was nearly a half inch in thickness, and covered with
_garrapatas_--fierce, burrowing vermin, with hooked claws, which
came upon the travelers and caused them intense annoyance throughout
the remainder of the journey.Then Reed shot a deer, a delicate, big-eyed creature that had never
seen a human being and was too surprised to flee.Later, Fidel Avila
felled another with a large stone.And, finally, monkeys became so
plentiful that the men all but refused to eat them any longer.Two weeks were spent around the mouth of the Tiguicito and the Boque
canon.The little party
shouldered their packs and began the ascent of the ragged gorge.For
days they clambered up and down the jagged walls of the cut, or
skirted its densely covered margin.Twice Harris fell into the
brawling stream below, and was fished out by Rosendo, his eyes
popping, and his mouth choked with uncomplimentary opinion regarding
mountain travel in the tropics.Once, seizing a slender vine to aid
him in climbing, he gave a sudden lurch and swung out unexpectedly
over the gorge, hundreds of feet deep.Again Rosendo, who by this time
had learned to keep one eye on the ground and the other on the
irresponsible Harris, rescued him from his perilous position."Why don't you watch where you are going?""I might," sputtered Harris, "if I could keep my eyes off of you."Whereat Carmen pursed her lips and told him to reserve his compliments
for those who knew how to appraise them rightly.They camped where night overtook them, out in the open, often falling
asleep without waiting to build a fire, but eating soggy corn _arepa_
and tinned food, and drinking cold coffee left from the early morning
repast.But sometimes, when the fatigue of day was less, they would
gather about their little fire, chilled and dripping, and beg Carmen
to sing to them while they prepared supper.Then her clear voice would
ring out over the great canon and into the vast solitudes on either
hand in strange, vivid contrast to the cries and weird sounds of the
jungle; and the two Americans would sit and look at her as if they
half believed her a creature from another world.Sometimes Harris
would draw her into conversation on topics pertaining to philosophy
and religion, for he had early seen her bent and, agnostic that he
was, delighted to hear her express her views, which to him were so
childishly impossible.But as often he would voluntarily retire from
the conflict, sometimes shaking his head dubiously, sometimes
muttering his impatience with a mere child whose logic he, despite his
collegiate training, could not refute.He was as full of philosophical
theories as a nut with meat; but when she asked for proofs, for less
human belief and more demonstration, he hoisted the white flag and
retired from the field.But his admiration for the child became
sincere.And by the time
they had reached the great divide through which the Rosario fell, he
was dimly aware of a feeling toward the beautiful creature who walked
at his side day after day, sharing without complaint hardship and
fatigue that sorely taxed his own endurance, that was something more
than mere regard, and he had begun to speculate vaguely on a possible
future in which she became the central figure.At Rosario creek they left the great canon and turned into the rugged
defile which wound its tortuous course upward into the heights of the
_Barra Principal_.They were now in a region where, in Rosendo's
belief, there was not one human being in an area of a hundred square
miles.He himself was in sore doubt as to the identity of the
_quebrada_ which they were following.But it tallied with the brief
description given him by Don Nicolas.And, moreover, which was even
more important, as they began its ascent there came to him that sense
of conviction which every true son of the jungle feels when he is
following the right course.He might not say how he knew he was right;
but he followed the leading without further question.Up over the steep talus at the base of the canon wall they clambered,
up into the narrowing _arroyo_, cutting every foot of the way, for the
_macheteros_ were now no longer keeping ahead of them--the common
danger held the band united.Often they believed they discovered
traces of ancient trails.But the jealous forest had all but
obliterated them, and they could not be certain.In the higher and
drier parts of the forest, where they left the creek and followed
the beds of dead streams, slender ditches through which the water
raced in torrents during the wet season, they were set upon by
countless swarms of bees, a strange, stingless variety that covered
them in a buzzing, crawling mass, struggling and fighting for the
salt in the perspiration which exuded from the human bodies.Harris
swore he would cease to eat, for he could not take even a mouthful
of food without at the same time taking in a multitude of bees.Often, too, their _machetes_ cut into great hornet nests.Then, with
the shrill cry, "_Avispas_!"Rosendo would tear recklessly through
the matted jungle, followed by his slapping, stumbling companions,
until the maddened insects gave up the chase.Frequently they
walked into huge ant nests before they realized it, sometimes the
great _tucanderas_, so ferociously poisonous."Ah, senores,"
commented Rosendo, as he once stopped to point out the marvelous
roadway cut by these insects for miles straight through the jungle,
"in the days of the Spaniards the cruel taskmasters would often tie
the weak and sick slaves to trees in the depths of the forest and
let these great ants devour them alive!Senores, you can never know
the terrible crimes committed by the Spaniards!"murmured Harris, eying Carmen furtively.But she knew, though she voiced it not, that the Spaniard had never
known the Christ.Night was spent on the summit of the divide.Then, without further
respite, Rosendo urged the descent.Down through ravines and gullies;
over monster bowlders; waist deep through streams; down the sheer
sides of gorges on natural ladders formed by the hanging _mora_
vines; skirting cliffs by the aid of tangled and interlaced roots
of rank, wet vegetation; and then down again into river bottoms,
where the tenacious mud challenged their every step, and the streams
became an interminable morass, through which passage was possible
only by jumping from root to root, where the gnarled feeders of the
great trees projected above the bottomless ooze.The persecution
of the _jejenes_ became diabolical.At dawn and sunset the raucous
bellow of the red-roarer monkeys made the air hideous.The
flickering lights of the forest became dismally depressing.The men
grew morose and sullen.Reed and Harris quarreled with each other on
the slightest provocation.Then, to increase their misery, came the rain.It fell upon them in
the river bottoms in fierce, driving gusts; then in sheets that
blotted out the forest and wet their very souls.The mountains roared and trembled with the hideous
cannonade of thunder.The jungle-matted hills ran with the flood.An
unvaried pall of vapor hung over the steaming ground, through which
uncanny, phantasmagoric shapes peered at the struggling little band.Again the sun burst forth, and a fiery vapor seethed above the moist
earth.The reek of their damp clothing and the acrid odor of the wet
soil increased the enervation of their hard travel.Again and again
the peevish Harris accused Rosendo of having lost the way.The old man
patiently bore the abuse.Reed chided Harris, and at length quarreled
violently with him, although his own apprehension waxed continually
greater.Hour after hour she toiled along,
floundering through the bogs, fording the deeper streams on Rosendo's
broad back, whispering softly to him at times, often seizing and
pressing his great horny hand, but holding her peace.In vain at
evening, when gathered about the damp, smudging firewood, Harris would
bring up to her the causes of her flight.In vain he would accuse the
unfortunate Alcalde, the Bishop, the soldiers.Carmen refused to lend
ear to it, or to see in it anything more than a varied expression of
the human mind.She
saw, not persons, not things, but expressions of thought in the
phenomena which had combined to urge her out of her former environment
and cast her into the trackless jungle.At length, one day, when it seemed to the exhausted travelers that
human endurance could stand no more, Rosendo, who had long been
straining his ears in the direction straight ahead, announced that the
singing noise which floated to them as they descended a low hill and
plunged into a thicket of tall lush grass, undoubtedly came from the
river Tigui.Another hour of straining and plunging through the dense
growth followed; and then, with a final effort, which manifested in a
sort of frenzied rush, the little band emerged suddenly upon the east
bank of the crystal stream, glittering and shimmering in the bright
morning sun as it sang and rippled on its solitary way through the
great jungle.The men threw off their packs and sprawled full length upon the
ground."La Colorado," he said, indicating what the Americans at length made
out to be a frame house, looming above the high grass."And there,"
pointing to the north, "is _Pozo Cayman_, where the trail begins that
leads to La Libertad."That night, as they lay on the rough board floor of the house at La
Colorado, Rosendo told them the story of the misguided Frenchmen who,
years before, had penetrated this wild region, located a barren quartz
vein, then floated a company and begun developments.The soil was fertile; the undeveloped country
ceaselessly rich in every resource, the water pure and sparkling, and
abounding in fish.The climate, too, was moderate and agreeable.It
seemed to the foreigners a terrestrial paradise.It crept out of the jungle like a thief in the night.One by one the Frenchmen fell sick and died.He remained to protect the
company's property.But he, too, fell a victim to the plague.One day,
as he lay burning upon his bed, he called feebly to his one remaining
servant, the native cook, to bring him the little package of quinine.She hastened to comply; but, alas!she brought the packet of
strychnine instead, and soon he, too, had joined his companions in
that unknown country which awaits us all.The old woman fled in
terror; and the evil spirits descended upon the place.They haunt it
yet, and no man approaches it but with trembling.Reed and Harris listened to the weird story with strange sensations.The clouds above had broken, and the late moon streamed through the
night vapor, and poured through the bamboo walls of the house.The
giant frogs in the nearby creek awoke, and through the long night
croaked their mournful plaint in a weird minor cadence that seemed to
the awed Americans to voice to the shimmering moon the countless
wrongs of the primitive Indians, who, centuries before, had roamed
this marvelous land in happy freedom, until the Spaniard descended
like a dark cloud and, with rack and stake, fastened his blighting
religion upon them.A day's rest at La Colorado sufficed to revive the spirits of the
party and prepare them for the additional eight or ten hour journey
over boggy morass and steep hill to La Libertad.For this trip Rosendo
would take only the Americans and Carmen.The _cargadores_ were not to
know the nature of this expedition, which, Rosendo announced, was
undertaken that the Americans might explore for two days the region
around the upper Tigui.The men received this explanation with grunts
of satisfaction.Trembling with suppressed excitement, oblivious now of fatigue,
hunger, or hardship, Reed and Harris followed the old man that day
over the ancient, obliterated trail to the forgotten mine of Don
Ignacio de Rincon.They experienced all the sensations of those who
find themselves at last on the course that leads to buried treasure.To Harris, the romance attaching to the expedition obliterated all
other considerations.But Reed was busy with the practical end of it,
with costs, with the problems of supplies, of transportation, and
trail.Carmen saw but one vision, the man in far-off Simiti, whose
ancestor once owned the great mine which lay just ahead of them.When night fell, the four stood, silent and wondering, at the mouth of
the crumbling tunnel, where lay a rusted shovel bearing the scarce
distinguishable inscription, "I de R."*       *       *       *       *

Two weeks later a group of natives, sitting at a feast of baked
alligator tail, at the mouth of the Amaceri, near the dirty,
straggling riverine town of Llano, rose in astonishment as they saw
issuing from the clayey, wallowing Guamoco trail a staggering band of
travelers, among them two foreigners, whose clothes were in shreds and
whose beards and unkempt hair were caked with yellow mud.With them
came a young girl, lightly clad and wearing torn rope _alpargates_ on
her bare feet.From the
neighboring town floated a brawling bedlam of human voices.It was
Sunday, and the villagers were celebrating a religious _fiesta_."_Compadres_," said Rosendo, approaching the half-intoxicated group.One of the group, his mouth too full to speak, pointed in expressive
pantomime up-stream.Rosendo murmured a fervent "_Loado sea Dios_,"
and sank upon the ground."It will be down to-morrow--to-day, perhaps," gurgled another of the
rapidly recovering feasters, his eyes roving from one member to
another of the weird-looking little band.exclaimed Harris, as he squatted upon the damp ground
and mopped his muddy brow."I'm a salamander for heat, that's
certain!""Senor," said Rosendo, addressing Reed, "it would be well to pay the
men at once, for the boat may appear at any time, and it will not wait
long."While the curious group from the village crowded about and eagerly
watched the proceedings, Reed unstrapped his pack and drew out a bundle
of Colombian bills, with which he began to pay the _cargadores_,
according to the reckoning which Rosendo had kept.As the last man,
with a grunt of satisfaction, received his money, Harris exclaimed:
"And to think, one good American dollar is worth a bushel of that paper
stuff!"The words were scarcely out of his mouth when a shrill whistle came
echoing down the river.A cloud of smoke above the distant treetops
heralded the approach of the steamer.The little party had escaped a
wait of a month in the drenching heat of Llano by the narrow margin of
an hour.Rosendo hastened to Reed and drew him aside.He tried to speak, but
words failed him."I understand, my friend," he
said gently.My wife
and I will care for the girl until we hear from you.And we will keep
in touch with you, although it will take two months for a letter to
reach us and our reply to get back again to Simiti.The development
company will be formed at once.Within six months you may expect to
see the work started.It is your fortune--and the girl's.""Padre, I am coming back to you--yes?""_Cierto, chiquita_!"The old man would not permit himself to say
more.The girl had known for some time that he was not to accompany
her to the States, and that she should not see Ana in Cartagena.To
this she had at length accustomed herself.In a few minutes the lumbering boat had swung around and thrown out
its gang plank.A hurried embrace; a struggle with rushing tears;
another shriek from the boat whistle; and the Americans, with Carmen
standing mute and motionless between them, looked back at the fading
group on shore, where Rosendo's tall figure stood silhouetted
against the green background of the forest.For a moment he held his
arm extended toward them.Carmen knew, as she looked at the
great-hearted man for the last time, that his benediction was
following her--following her into that new world into which he might
not enter.*       *       *       *       *

Reed lifted the silent, wondering, big-eyed girl from the dinkey
train which pulled into Cartagena from Calamar ten days later, and
took her to the Hotel Mariana, where his anxious, fretting wife
awaited.Their boat had hung on a hidden bar in the Cauca river
for four interminable, torturing days.CHAPTER 39


On the day that Carmen arrived in Cartagena, Rosendo staggered down
the Guamoco trail into Simiti.On that same momentous day the flames
of war again flared up throughout the country.The Simiti episode, in
which the President had interfered, brought Congress to the necessity
of action.A few days of fiery debate followed; then the noxious
measure was taken from the table and hastily enacted into a law.But news travels slowly in Latin America, and some time was required
for this act of Congress to become generally known.The delay saw
Carmen through the jungle and down to the coast.There Reed lost no
time in transacting what business still remained for him in Cartagena,
and securing transportation for his party to New York.Jose, the shadow of his former self, clung pitiably to Rosendo's hand,
imploring the constant repetition of the old man's narrative.Then
came Juan, flying to the door.He had seen and talked with the
returned _cargadores_.Neither Jose nor Rosendo could
calm him.At length it seemed wise to them both to tell him that she
had gone to the States with the Americans, and would return to Simiti
no more.He gathered groups of companions about him and talked to them
excitedly.Then, evidently acting on
the advice of some cooler head, he rushed to his canoe and put off
across the lake toward the _cano_.But when he did, the town knew that he had been to Bodega Central, and
that the country was aflame with war.*       *       *       *       *

Reed's wife had not received Carmen in an amiable frame of mind."For
heaven's sake, Charles," she had cried, turning from his embrace to
look at the wondering girl who stood behind him, "what have you
here?""Oh, that," he laughingly replied, "is only a little Indian I lassoed
back in the jungle."And, leaving the girl to the not very tender
graces of his wife, he hurried out to arrange for the return voyage.At noon, when Harris appeared at Reed's room, Carmen rushed to him and
begged to be taken for a stroll through the town.Yielding to her
husband's insistence, Mrs.Reed had outfitted the girl, so that she
presented a more civilized appearance.At first Carmen had been
delighted with her new clothes.They were such, cheap as they were, as
she had never seen in Simiti.But the shoes--"Ah, senora," she
pleaded, "do not make me wear them, they are so tight!She was beginning her education in the conventions
and trammels of civilization.As Carmen and Harris stood that afternoon in the public square, while
the girl gazed enraptured at an equestrian statue of Simon Bolivar, a
ragged little urchin approached and begged them to buy an afternoon
paper.Harris humored him and bade Carmen ask him his name."Rincon," the lad answered, drawing himself up proudly."In the Calle Lozano," he replied, wondering why these people seemed
interested in him."Ask him who his father
is," suggested the latter."I do not know," replied the little fellow, shaking his head.He lives far away, up the great river, so Tia Catalina says."Come with me to your home,"
she said, taking his hand.The boy led them willingly through the winding streets to the little
upper room where, years before, he had first seen the light."Tia Catalina," he cried to the shabby woman who rose in amazement as
the visitors entered, "see, some strangers!"Carmen lost no time, but went at once to the heart of her question."The little fellow's father--he is a Rincon?And--he lives up the
great river?"The woman eyed her suspiciously for some moments without replying."Yes, senorita," he said eagerly, "in
Simiti.And his name--I am named for him--it is Jose.And I am going
to visit him some day.Tia Catalina said I should, no, Tia?"Harris fumbled in his pocket and drew out some money, which he handed
to the woman.Her eyes lighted, and a cavernous smile spread over her
wrinkled face."_Ah, gracias, senor_," she murmured, bending over his hand; "we need
it.The boy's father has sent us but little of late."Carmen's heart was fluttering wildly."Tell me," she said in a cold
voice, "the boy's father is Padre Jose de Rincon, of Simiti?We have just come from Simiti, and have seen him.We are leaving to-morrow for the States.""Yes, senorita," replied the woman in a thin, cracking voice, now
completely disarmed of her suspicion."The little fellow was born here
some seven years ago.But the good Padre has sent
us money ever since to care for him, until of late.Senorita, why is
it, think you, that he sends us so little now?""I--do--not--know," murmured Carmen abstractedly, scarce hearing the
woman.She bent over him and looked long
and wistfully into his eyes.He was a bright, handsome little fellow;
and though her heart was crushed, she took him into it.Swallowing the
lump which had come into her throat, she drew him to the window and
sat down, holding him before her."Your father--I know him--well.But--I did not
know--I never knew that he had a son.""Tia Catalina says he is a fine man," proudly answered the boy."And she wants me to be a priest, too.But I am going to be a
bull-fighter.""It is true, senorita," interposed the woman."We cannot keep him
from the _arena_ now.He hangs about it all day, and about the
slaughter-house.We can hardly drag him back to his meals.What
can we do, senorita?But," with a touch of pride as she looked at him,
"if he becomes a bull-fighter, he will be the best of them all!"Her question carried an appeal which
came from the depths of her soul."Senora, is there no doubt--no doubt
that Padre Rincon is the father of the boy?"The lad's mother died in the good Padre's
arms.She would not say positively who was the boy's father.We
thought at first--it was some one else.Marcelena insisted on it to
her dying day.But now--now we know that it was Padre Jose.And he was
sent to Simiti for it.But--ah, senorita, the little mother was so
beautiful, and so good!She--but, senorita, you are not leaving so
soon?""Yes, my good senora," she said wearily."We must
now return to the hotel.But--here is more money for the boy.And,
senora, when I reach the States I will send you money every month for
him.""Come," she said simply, "I have seen enough
of the city."*       *       *       *       *

At noon the next day a message from Bodega Central was put into the
hand of the acting-Bishop of Cartagena, as he sat in his study,
wrapped in the contemplation of certain papers before him.Hostilities
had begun along the Magdalena river the day before.The gates of
Cartagena were to be barricaded that day, for a boatload of rebels was
about to leave Barranquilla to storm the city and seize, if possible,
the customs.When he had read the message he uttered an exclamation.Had not the Sister Superior of the Convent of Our Lady reported the
arrival of the daughter of Rosendo Ariza some days before?He seized
his hat and left the room.Hastening to the Department of Police, he had a short interview with
the chief.Then that official despatched policemen to the office of
the steamship company, and to the dock.Their orders were to arrest
two Americans who were abducting a young girl.They returned a half
hour later with sheepish faces."Your Excellency," they announced to
their chief, "the vessel sailed from the port an hour ago, with the
Americans and the girl aboard."The announcement aroused in Wenceslas the fury of a tiger.Exacerbation
succeeded surprise; and that in turn gave way to a maddening thirst for
sanguinary vengeance.He hastened out and despatched a telegraphic
message to Bogota.Then he returned to his study to await its effect.Two days later a river steamer, impressed by the federal authorities,
stopped at the mouth of the Boque, and a squad of soldiers marched
over the unfrequented trail to Simiti, where they arrived as night
fell.Their orders were to take into custody the priest, Jose de
Rincon, who was accused of complicity in the recent plot to overthrow
the existing government.At the same time, on a vessel plowing its way into the North, a young
girl, awkwardly wearing her ill-fitting garments, hung over the rail
and gazed wistfully back at the Southern Cross.The tourists who saw
her heterogeneous attire laughed.But when they looked into her
beautiful, sad face their mirth died, and a tender pity stirred their
hearts.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The blanket of wet fog which had hung over the harbor with such
exasperating tenacity lifted suddenly, late in the raw fall afternoon,
and revealed to the wondering eyes of the girl who stood alone at the
rail of the _Joachim_ a confusion of mountainous shadows, studded with
myriad points of light which glittered and shimmered beneath the gray
pall.Across the heaving waters came the dull, ominous breathing of
the metropolis.Clouds of heavy, black smoke wreathed about the bay.Through it shrieking water craft darted and wriggled in endless
confusion.For two days the port of New York had been a bedlam of raw
sound, as the great sirens of the motionless vessels roared their
raucous warnings through the impenetrable veil which enveloped them.Their noise had become acute torture to the impatient tourists, and
added bewilderment to the girl.The transition from the primitive simplicity of her tropical home had
not been one of easy gradation, but a precipitate plunge.The
convulsion which ensued from the culmination of events long gathering
about little Simiti had hurled her through the forest, down the
scalding river, and out upon the tossing ocean with such swiftness
that, as she now stood at the portal of a new world, she seemed to be
wandering through the mazes of an intricate dream.During the ocean
voyage she had kept aloof from the other passengers, partly because of
embarrassment, partly because of the dull pain at her heart as she
gazed, day after day, at the two visions which floated always before
her: one, the haggard face of the priest, when she tore herself from
his arms in far-off Simiti; the other, that of the dark-faced,
white-haired old man who stood on the clayey river bank at wretched
Llano and watched her, with eager, straining eyes, until the winding
stream hid her from his earthly sight--forever.She wondered dully now
why she had left them, why she had so easily yielded to the influences
which had caused the separation.They might have fled to the jungle
and lived there in safety and seclusion.The malign influences which
beset them all in Simiti never could have reached them in the
trackless forest.And yet, she knew that had not Rosendo and Jose held
out to her, almost to the last moment, assurances of a speedy reunion,
she would not have yielded to the pressure which they had exerted, and
to the allurements of life in the wonderful country to which they had
sent her.Her embarrassment on the boat was due largely to a sense of
awkwardness in the presence of women who, to her provincial sight,
seemed visions of beauty.To be sure, the priest had often shown her
pictures of the women of the outside world, and she had some idea of
their dress.But that such a vast difference existed between the
illustrations and the actualities, she had never for a moment
imagined.Their gowns, their jewels, their coiffures held her in
open-mouthed marvel, until Mrs.Reed, herself annoyed and embarrassed,
remanded her to her cabin and bade her learn the impropriety of such
manners.Nor had the conduct of this lady throughout the voyage conduced to
Carmen's happiness.Reed showed plainly that the girl was an
awkward embarrassment to her; that she was tolerated because of
reasons which pertained solely to her husband's business; and she took
pains to impress upon her fellow-travelers that, in view of the
perplexing servant problem, this unmannered creature was being taken
to the States to be trained as a maid, though, heaven knew!the
training would be arduous, and the result uncertain.Reed, though measurably kind, gave Carmen scant attention.Harris
alone saved the girl from almost complete neglect.He walked the deck
with her, regardless of the smiles of the other passengers.He taught
her to play shuffle-board, checkers, and simple card games.He
conducted her over the boat and explained the intricate machinery and
the numberless wonders of the great craft.He sat with her out on the
deck at night and told her marvelous stories of his experiences in
frontier camps.And at the table he insisted that she occupy the seat
next to him, despite the protestations of the chief steward, who would
have placed her apart with the servants.Carmen said little, but she clung to the man with an appeal which,
though mute, he nevertheless understood.At Kingston he took her on a
drive through the town, and bought post cards for her to send back to
Jose and Rosendo.It consoled her immeasurably when he glowingly
recounted the pleasure her loved ones would experience on receiving
these cards; and thereafter the girl daily devoted hours to the
preparation of additional ones to be posted in New York.The lifting of the fog was the signal for a race among the stalled
craft to gain the harbor entrance.The enforced retention of the
vessels in the bay had resulted in much confusion in docking, and the
_Joachim_ was assigned to a pier not her own.The captain grumbled,
but had no choice.At the pier opposite there docked a huge liner from
Havre; and the two boats poured their swarming human freight into the
same shed.When the gang plank dropped, Harris took charge of Carmen,
while Reed and his wife preceded them ashore, the latter giving a
little scream of delight as she spied her sister and some friends with
a profusion of flowers awaiting her on the pier.She rushed joyfully
into their arms, while Reed hastened to his equipage with a customs
officer.But as Harris and the bewildered Carmen pushed into the great crowd in
the shed, the absent-minded man suddenly remembered that he had left a
bundle of Panama hats underneath his bunk.Dropping the girl's hand,
the impetuous fellow tore back up the gang plank and dived into the
boat.For a moment Carmen, stood in confusion, bracing herself against
the swarming multitude, and clinging tenaciously to the small,
paper-wrapped bundle which she carried.But the eager, belated crowd almost swept her off her
feet, and she turned again, drifting slowly with it toward the
distant exit.As she moved uncertainly, struggling the while to
prevent being crushed against the wall, she felt some one grasp her
hand.sounded a gentle voice close to her ear.Come, they are waiting for
us up ahead."It was a woman, comely of feature,
and strikingly well dressed.The
anxious fears of a moment before vanished.Reed and the others are waiting for us.The automobiles came for you all; but I presume the
others have gone by this time.However, you and I will follow in mine.the girl asked eagerly, as the woman forced a way for them
through the mass of humanity."Did he write to you--from Simiti?"He said
your name was--"

"Carmen," interrupted the girl, with a great surge of gladness, for
here was one woman who did not avoid her.cried Carmen, suddenly stopping as she remembered.He knows where to find the
automobiles.I will leave word with the pier-master to tell him."By this time they had wormed their way clear of the crowd and gained
the street.The woman, still retaining Carmen's hand, went directly to
a waiting automobile and pushed the unresisting girl through the open
door.Carmen had never seen a conveyance like this, and her thought
was instantly absorbed.And
then, sinking into the luxurious cushions, she fell to speculating as
to how the thing was moved.As the chauffeur reached back to close the door a policeman, who had
been eying the party since they came out of the shed, stepped up and
laid a hand on the car."Er--little girl," he said, looking in and addressing Carmen,
"_you--you know this lady, do you_?""Yes," replied Carmen, looking up confidently into the woman's smiling
face.She thought his blue uniform
and shining buttons and star gorgeously beautiful.Suspicion lurked in his eyes as
he looked at the woman and then back again at the girl."She is a little girl who came up from the South with my nephew, Mr.I
will give you my card, if you wish."The chauffeur, too, as he got out and
leisurely examined his engine, served further to disarm suspicion.The
officer raised up and removed his hand from the machine.The chauffeur
slowly mounted the box and threw on his lever.As the car moved gently
into the night the officer glanced at its number.What's a fellow going to do in a case like this, I'd like to know--go
with 'em?"Some minutes later, Harris, wild and disheveled, followed by Reed and
his party, emerged hurriedly into the street.asked the officer, planting himself in front
of Harris, and becoming vaguely apprehensive.sputtered Harris, his eyes protruding and his long arms pawing
the air."Girl--so high--funny dress--big straw hat!Aunt took her just now in an auto!"For a moment they all stood silent, big-eyed and gaping.The
girl came up from South America with me.Describe the woman--"

"Reed!"cried the policeman excitedly, his eyes lighting.cried the distracted Harris,
menacing the confused officer.Night had fallen, and a curious crowd was gathering around the
excited, noisy group.Reed quickly signaled a taxicab and hustled the
bewildered officer into it."You, Harris, get the women folks home,
and wait for me!I'll go to central with this officer and report the
case!""I'm going to visit every dance hall
and dive in this bloomin' town before I go home!And you, you blithering idiot," shaking a fist at the
officer, "you're going to lose your star for this!"Meantime, the car, in which Carmen lay deep in the soft cushions, sped
through the dusk like a fell spirit.A confused jumble of shadows flew
past, and strange, unfamiliar noises rose from the animated streets.The lights shimmered on the moist glass.The girl
ceased trying to read any meaning in it.It all fused into a blur; and
she closed her eyes and gave herself up to the novel sensations
stimulated by her first ride in a carriage propelled--she knew not
how.At length came a creaking, a soft, skidding motion, and the big car
rolled up against a curb and stopped."We are home now," said the woman softly, as she descended and again
took Carmen's hand.They hurriedly mounted the white stone steps of a
tall, gloomy building and entered a door that seemed to open
noiselessly at their approach.A glare of light burst upon the
blinking eyes of the girl.A <DW64> woman softly closed the door after
them.With a wondering glance, Carmen looked about her.In the room at
her right she caught a glimpse of women--beautiful, they seemed to
her--clad in loose, low-cut, gaily  gowns.There were men
there, too; and some one sat at a piano playing sprightly music.She
had seen pianos like that in Cartagena, and on the boat, and they had
seemed to her things bewitched.In the room at the end of the hall men
and women were dancing on a floor that seemed of polished glass.Loud
talk, laughter, and singing floated through the rooms, and the air
was warm and stuffy, heavy with perfume.The odor reminded her of the
roses in her own little garden in Simiti.It was all beautiful,
wonderful, fairy-like.But she had only a moment for this appraisal.Seizing her hand again,
the woman whisked her up the flight of stairs before them and into a
warm, light room.Then, without speaking, she went out and closed the
door, leaving the girl alone.Carmen sank into a great, upholstered rocking chair and tried to grasp
it all as she swayed dreamily back and forth.She
wondered if Harris dwelt in a place of such heavenly beauty; for he
had said that he did not live with Reed.What would the stupid people
of Simiti think could they see her now!She had never dreamed that
such marvels existed in the big world beyond her dreary, dusty, little
home town!Jose had told her much, ah, wonderful things!But how pitifully inadequate now seemed all their stories!She
still wondered what had made that carriage go in which she had come up
from the boat.Would her interest in
La Libertad suffice to buy one?She passed her hand over
the clean, white counterpane of the bed."Oh," she murmured, "how
beautiful!"She went dreamily to the bureau and took up, one by one,
the toilet articles that lay there in neat array.she
murmured, again and again.The
little figure reflected there contrasted so oddly with the gorgeously
beautiful ones she had glimpsed below that she laughed aloud.Then she
went to the window and felt of the soft curtains."It is heaven," she
murmured, facing about and sweeping the room, "just heaven!Oh, how
beautiful even the human mind can be!I never thought it, I never
thought it!"Again she sat down in the big rocker and gave herself up to the charm
of her surroundings.Her glance fell upon a vase of flowers that stood
on a table near another window.She rose and went to them, bending
over to inhale their fragrance.she exclaimed, as she
felt them crackle in her fingers.But she would learn, ere long, that they fittingly symbolized the life
of the great city in which she was now adrift.She began to wonder why the woman did not return.Were
not the Reeds anxious to know of her safe arrival?It was a ball--but so
different from the simple, artless _baile_ of her native town.Stray
snatches of music drifted into the room from the piano below.She went to the door, thinking to open
it a little and listen.She went hastily, instinctively, to a window and raised the
curtain.She remembered suddenly
that prison windows were like that.Terror's clammy hand gripped at her heart.Then she
caught herself--and laughed.she exclaimed, sinking again
into the rocker.At that moment the door opened noiselessly and a woman entered.She
was younger than the one who had met the boat.When she saw the girl
she uttered an exclamation.Carmen glanced down at her odd attire and then smiled up at the woman.The woman laughed, a sharp, unmusical laugh.The dry cosmetic
plastered thick upon her cheeks cracked.She was not beautiful like
the others, thought Carmen.Her cheeks were sunken, and her low-cut
gown revealed great, protruding collarbones."Come," she said
abruptly, "get out of those rags and into something modern."She
opened a closet door and selected a gown from a number hanging there.It was white, and there was a gay ribbon at the waist."It'll have to be pinned up," she commented to herself, holding it out
before her and regarding Carmen critically.she exclaimed, "am I to wear that?The woman returned no answer, but opened a bureau drawer and took from
it several other garments, which she threw upon a chair, together with
the dress."Into the whole lot of 'em," she said sharply, indicating the
garments."And move lively, for supper's waitin' and there'll be
callers soon--gentlemen callers," she added, smiling grimly.The woman stopped
abruptly and stood with arms akimbo, regarding the girl.Carmen gazed
up at her with a smile of happy, trustful assurance.She mentioned Simiti, Padre Jose, and Rosendo.Her
voice quavered a little; but she brightened up and concluded: "And Mr.Reed's Auntie, she met us--that is, me.Oh, isn't she a beautiful
lady!"The woman seemed to be fascinated by the child's gaze.Then, suddenly,
as if something had given way under great strain, she cried: "For
God's sake, don't look at me that way!She dropped into
a chair and continued to stare at the girl."Well, I've told you," replied Carmen."But," she continued, going
quickly to the woman and taking her hand, "you haven't told me your
name yet.And we are going to be such good friends, aren't we?And you are going to tell me all about this beautiful house, and
that wonderful carriage I came here in.Reed will take me out in it every
day!"Then, in a low voice:

"Your mother--is she living?""But my mother, my own real mother,
she died, long, long ago, on the banks of the great river.My father
left her, and she was trying to follow him.Then I was born--"

"The same old story!""I've been there,
girl, and know all about it.I followed the man--but it was my kid
that died!God, if I could have laid my hands on him!And now you have
come here--"

She stopped abruptly and swallowed hard.Carmen gently stole an arm
about her neck."It isn't true," she murmured, laying her soft cheek
against the woman's painted one."No one can desert us or harm us, for
_God is everywhere_.Padre Jose said I had a message for the people up here; and now you
are the first one I've told it to.And if we know that, why, nothing bad can ever happen to us.But you
didn't know it when your husband left you, did you?"Then she looked up into the girl's
deep, wondering eyes and checked herself."Come," she said abruptly,
rising and still holding her hand."We'll go down to supper now as you
are."Carmen's companion led her down the stairs and through the hall to a
brightly lighted room at the rear, where about a long table sat a half
dozen women.There were places for as many more, but they were
unoccupied.The cloth was white, the glass shone, the silver
sparkled.And the women, who glanced up at the girl, were clad in
gowns of such gorgeous hues as to make the child gasp in amazement.Over all hung the warm, perfumed air that she had thought so delicious
when she had first entered the house.The woman led her to a chair next to
the one she herself took.Carmen looked around for the lady who had
met her at the boat.The silence and the steady
scrutiny of the others began to embarrass her."Where--where is
Auntie?"she asked timidly, looking up at her faded attendant.One of the women, who swayed slightly
in her chair, looked up stupidly.A burst of laughter followed this remark, and Carmen sat down
in confusion.asked one of the younger women of Carmen's
attendant.Headache," was the laconic reply."She landed a queen this time, didn't she?"looking admiringly at
Carmen."Gets me, how the old girl does it!"Carmen," replied the girl timidly, looking questioningly about the
room."Carmen Ariza," the child amended, as her big, wondering eyes swept
the group."Where do you hail from,
angel-face?"The girl looked uncomprehendingly at her interlocutor."Tell them where you lived, child," said the woman called Jude in a
low voice."Simiti," replied Carmen, tears choking her words.A
burst of mirth punctuated the question."Long way from Paris, judging by the fashions."Carmen answered in a scarcely audible voice, "South America."Low exclamations of astonishment encircled the table, while the women
sat regarding the girl curiously."But," continued Carmen in a trembling voice, "where is Mrs.Her beautiful face wore
such an expression of mingled fear, uncertainty, and helplessness as
to throw a hush upon the room.she
muttered, "it's a shame!"She looked for a moment uncertainly into the
big, deep eyes of the girl, and then turned and hastily left the
room.The silence which followed was broken by a pallid, painted creature at
the end of the table."What an old devil the Madam is!One look into those eyes
would have been enough for me!""This is only a recruiting
station for the regular army.She'll go over to French Lucy's; and the
Madam will get a round price for the job.""Old Lucy'll get rich off of her!Ames owns
her house, too, doesn't he?"replied Jude, brightening under the stimulus of her
wine."He owns every house in this block, they say.The Madam rolls on the
floor and cusses for a week straight every time she pays hers.But
just the same, if you've ever noticed, the houses that Ames owns are
never raided by the coppers.Ames whacks up with the mayor and the
city hall gang and the chief of police.That means protection, and we
pay for it in high rents.But it's a lot better'n being swooped down
on by the cops every few weeks, ain't it?We know what we're expected
to pay, that way.And we never do when we keep handin' it out to the
cops."And he's got a new
collector, fellow from the Ketchim Realty Company.They're the old
man's agents now for his dive-houses.He can't get anybody else to
handle 'em, so the collector tells me.""Belle Carey's place was pulled last night, I hear," said one of the
women, pushing back her plate and lighting a cigarette."Yes," returned Jude, "and why?Cause the house is owned by
Gannette--swell guy livin' up on Riverside Drive--and he don't divvy
with the city hall.Belle don't pay no such rent as the Madam does--at
least so old Lucy tells me."The half-intoxicated woman down the table, who had stirred their
laughter a few minutes before, now roused up heavily.Caught a pippin for her once--right off
the train--jus' like this li'l hussy.Went to th' depot in a hack.Saw
th' li'l kid comin' an' pretended to faint.Li'l kid run to me an'
asked could she help.Got her to see me safe home--tee!She's
workin' f'r ol' Lucy yet, sound's a dollar."She fixed her bleared eyes upon Carmen and lapsed back into her former
state of sodden stupidity.The policeman's words at the
pier were floating confusedly through her thought.The strange talk of
these women increased the confusion.Another of the women got up hurriedly and left the table."I haven't
the nerve for another sob-scene," she commented as she went out.pleaded Carmen, turning from one to
another.Jude reached out and seized her hand tightly.Then, to Carmen:

"You are in a--a hotel," she said abruptly."Oh--then--then it was a mistake?"The girl turned her great, yearning
eyes upon the woman."Sit down, and finish
your supper," she said harshly, pulling the girl toward the chair.The maudlin woman down the table chuckled thickly.The <DW64> waitress
went quickly out and closed the door.Jude rose, still holding the
girl's hand."Come up stairs with me," she said, leading her away.commented one of the women, when the two had left the
room.But she's housekeeper, and that's part of her job.Jude took the girl into her own room and locked the door.Then she
sank wearily into a chair.she cried, "I'm sick of this--sick
of the whole thing!"It was all a
mistake, and we can go.""Why, you said this was a hotel--"

"Hotel!Carmen gazed at the excited woman with a puzzled expression on her
face."Now listen," said Jude, bracing herself, "I've got something to tell
you.For God's sake, child,
don't look at me that way!"Your face looks as if you had come down from the sky.But if you did,
and if you believe in a God, you had better pray to Him now!"I was afraid--a
little--at first.When we stop and just know that we love
everybody, and that everybody really loves us, why, we can't be afraid
any more, can we?"The woman looked up at the child in blank amazement.That
warped, twisted word conveyed no meaning to her.And God--it was only
a convenient execrative.But--what was it that looked out from that
strange girl's eyes?What
was emerging from those unfathomable depths, twining itself about her
withered heart and expanding her black, shrunken soul?Whence came
that beautiful, white life that she was going to blast?"Look here," she cried sharply, "tell me again all about yourself, and
about your friends and family down south, and what it was that the
Madam said to you!Carmen sat down at her feet, and taking her hand, went again over the
story.As the child talked, the woman's hard eyes widened, and now and
then a big tear rolled down the painted cheek.Her thought began to
stray back, far back, along the wreck-strewn path over which she
herself had come.At last in the dim haze she saw again the little New
England farm, and her father, stern, but honest and respected,
trudging behind the plow.In the cottage she saw her white-haired
mother, every lineament bespeaking her Puritan origin, hovering over
her little household like a benediction.Then night fell, swiftly as
the eagle swoops down upon its prey, and she awoke from a terrible
dream, stained, abandoned, lost--and seared with a foul oath to drag
down to her own level every innocent girl upon whom her hands might
thereafter fall!"And I have just had to know," Carmen concluded, "every minute since I
left Simiti, that God was everywhere, and that He would not let any
harm come to me.But when we really know that, why, the way _always_
opens.For that's prayer, right prayer; the kind that Jesus taught."The woman sat staring at the girl, an expression of utter blankness
upon her pallid face.Oh, yes, she had been taught to pray.Well she remembered, though the memory now cut like a knife, how she
knelt at her beautiful mother's knee and asked the good Father to
bless and protect them all, even to the beloved doll that she hugged
to her little bosom.But God had never heard her petitions, innocent
though she was.And He had let her fall, even with a prayer on her
lips, into the black pit!A loud sound of male voices and a stamping of feet rose from below.The woman sprang to the door and stood listening."It's the boys from
the college!"She turned and stood hesitant for a moment, as if striving to
formulate a plan.A look of fierce determination came into her face.She went to the bureau and took from the drawers several articles,
which she hastily thrust into the pocket of her dress."Now," she said, turning to Carmen and speaking in a low, strained
voice, "you do just as I say.And for God's sake
don't speak!"Leaving the light burning, she stepped quickly out with Carmen and
locked the door after her.Then, bidding the girl wait, she slipped
softly down the hall and locked the door of the room to which the girl
had first been taken.Laughter and music floated up from below, mingled with the clink of
glasses.The air was heavy with perfume and tobacco smoke.A door near
them opened, and a sound of voices issued.The woman pulled Carmen
into a closet until the hall was again quiet.Then she hurried on to
another door which she entered, dragging the girl with her.Groping through the darkness, she reached a
window, across which stood a hinged iron grating, secured with a
padlock.The woman fumbled among her keys and unfastened this.Swinging it wide, and opening the window beyond, she bade the girl
precede her cautiously."It's a fire-escape," she explained briefly.She reached through the
window grating and fastened the padlock; then closed the window; and
quickly descended with the girl to the ground below.Pausing a moment to get her breath, she seized Carmen's hand and crept
swiftly around the big house and into a dark alley.There she stopped
to throw over her shoulders a light shawl which she had taken from the
bureau.Their course lay through the muddy alley for several blocks.When they
emerged they were in a dimly lighted cross street.The air was chill,
and the thinly clad woman shivered.Carmen, fresh from the tropics,
felt the contrast keenly.A few moments' rapid walking down the street
brought them to a large building of yellow brick, surrounded by a high
board fence.The woman unfastened the gate and hurried up to the door,
over which, by the feeble light of the street lamp, Carmen read, "The
Little Sisters of the Poor."A black-robed woman admitted them and went to summon the Sister
Superior.Carmen marveled at her strange attire.A moment later they
were silently ushered into an adjoining room, where a tall woman,
similarly dressed, awaited them."Sister," said Jude excitedly, "here's a little kid--you got to care
for her until she finds her friends!"The Sister Superior instantly divined the status of the woman."Let
the child wait here a moment," she said, "and you come with me and
tell your story.It would be better that she should not hear."Carmen was drowsing in her
chair."She's chock full of religion," the woman was saying."But you," the Sister replied, "what will you do?"Then you will stay here until--"

"No, no!I have friends--others like myself--I will go to them.I--I
couldn't stay here--with her," nodding toward the girl."But--you will
take care of her?""Surely," returned the Sister in a calm voice.Then she turned abruptly and went swiftly out into the chill night."Come," said the Sister to Carmen, extending a hand.CHAPTER 2


Carmen was astir next morning long before the rising-bell sounded its
shrill summons through the long corridors.When she opened her eyes
she gazed at the ceiling above in perplexity.She still seemed to feel
the tossing motion of the boat, and half believed the bell to be the
call to the table, where she should again hear the cheery voice of
Harris and meet the tolerant smile of Mrs.Then a rush of
memories swept her, and her heart went down in the flood.She was
alone in a great foreign city!She turned her face to the pillow, and
for a moment a sob shook her.Then she reached under the pillow and
drew out the little Bible, which she had taken from her bundle and
placed there when the Sister left her the night before.The book fell
open to Isaiah, and she read aloud:

  "I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine
  hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the
  people, for a light of the Gentiles.""That means me," she said
firmly."Padre Jose said I had a message for the world; and now I
am to tell it to these people up here.That means, He has called me to do _right thinking_.And I am to tell these people how to think right.Suddenly her thought reverted to Cartagena, and to the sturdy little
lad who had so proudly claimed the name of Rincon.Then she burst into tears and threw herself back upon the
bed."I must think only God's thoughts,"
she said, struggling to her feet and checking her grief."If it is
right for the little boy to be his son, then I must want it to be so.I _must_ want only the right--I have _got_ to want it!And if it is
not right now, then God will make it so.It is all in His hands, and I
must not think of it any more, unless I think right thoughts."She dressed herself quickly, but did not put on the shoes."I simply
can not wear these things," she mourned, looking at them dubiously;
"and I do not believe the woman will make me.I wonder why the other
woman called her Sister.Why did she wear that ugly black bonnet?And
why was I hurried away from that hotel?It was so much pleasanter
there, so bright and warm; and here it is so cold."She shivered as
she buttoned her thin dress."But," she continued, "I have got to go
out now and find Mr.Harris--I have just _got_ to find
them--and to-day!But, oh, this city is so much larger than Simiti!"She shook her head in perplexity as she put the Bible back again in
the bundle, where lay the title papers to La Libertad and her mother's
little locket, which Rosendo had given her that last morning in
Simiti.The latter she drew out and regarded wistfully for some
moments."I haven't any father or mother but God," she murmured."But
He is both father and mother to me now."With a little sigh she tied
up the bundle again.Holding it in one hand and carrying the much
despised shoes in the other, she left the cheerless room and started
down the long, cold hall.When she reached the stairway leading to the floor below she stopped
abruptly."I have been
thinking only of myself.What is it that the Bible says?--'And I will bring them by a way
that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not
known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things
straight.'And Padre Jose said he would
remember it, too."Again she choked back the tears which surged up at the remembrance of
the priest, and, bracing herself, hastily descended the stairs,
murmuring at every step, "God is everywhere--right here!"At the far end of the lower hall she saw, through an open door, a
number of elderly people sitting at long tables.When she reached the door, she stopped and peered
curiously within.A murmur of astonishment rose from the inmates
when they caught sight of the quaint object in the doorway, standing
uncertainly, with her shoes in one hand, the awkwardly tied bundle in
the other, and garbed in the chaotic attire so hastily procured for
her in Cartagena.A Sister came quickly forward and, taking the girl's hand, led her
into a smaller adjoining room, where sat the Sister Superior at
breakfast.The latter greeted the child gently and bade her be seated
at the table.Carmen dropped into a chair and sat staring in naive
wonder."Well," began the Sister at length, "eat your breakfast quickly.This
is Sunday, you know, and Mass will be said in the chapel in half an
hour.But you are with friends
here, little girl.Carmen quickly recovered her spirits, and her nimble tongue its wonted
flexibility.Without further invitation or preface she entered at once
upon a lively description of her wonderful journey through the jungle,
the subsequent ocean voyage, and the mishap at the pier, and concluded
with the cryptical remark: "And, you know, Senora, it is all just as
Padre Jose said, only a series of states of consciousness, after
all!"The Sister stared blankly at the beaming child.What manner of being
was this that had been so strangely wafted into these sacred precincts
on the night breeze!The abandoned woman who had brought her there,
the Sister remembered, had dropped an equally cryptical remark--"She's
chock full of religion."But gratitude quickly mastered her wonder, and the woman, pondering
the child's dramatic recital, murmured a sincere, "The Virgin be
praised!""Oh," said Carmen, looking up quickly as she caught the words, "you
people up here talk just like those in Simiti.But Padre Jose said you
didn't know, either.You ought to, though, for you have had so many
more ad--advantages than we have.Senora, there are many big, clumsy
words in the English language, aren't there?We used to speak it all the time during the
last years we were together.He said it seemed easier to talk about
God in that language than in any other."And who is this
Jose that you talk so much about?""He--taught me--in Simiti."Well," replied the Sister warmly, "he seems to have taught you queer
things!"returned Carmen quickly, "he just taught me the truth.He
didn't tell me about the queer things in the world, for he said they
were not real."Again the Sister stared at the girl in dumb amazement.But the child's
thought had strayed to other topics.she
exclaimed, shivering and drawing her dress about her."I guess I'll
have to put on these shoes to keep my feet warm.""Didn't you
wear shoes in your country?""No," replied Carmen, tugging and straining at the shoes; "I didn't
wear much of anything, it was so warm.Oh, it is beautiful down there,
Senora, so beautiful and warm in Simiti!"She sighed, and her eyes
filled with tears.But she brushed them away and smiled bravely up at
the Sister."I've come here because it is right," she said with a firm
nod of her head."Padre Jose said I had a message for you.He said you
didn't know much about God up here.Why, I don't know much of anything
else!"She laughed a happy little laugh as she said this.Then she
went on briskly:

"You know, Senora, Padre Jose isn't really a priest.But he said he
had to stay in the Church in order to teach me.I am sure he just thought wrong about it.But, anyway,
he will not have to be a priest any more, now that I have gone, will
he?You know, Don Jorge said priests were a bad lot; but that isn't
so, for there are many good priests, aren't there?Why, Senora," she exclaimed,
suddenly remembering the Sister's previous injunction, "is this a
church?You said there would be Mass in the chapel--"

"No," replied the Sister, still studying the girl attentively, while
her manner became more severe; "this is a home for old people, a
charitable institution.""Oh," replied Carmen, with a very vague idea of what that meant."Well," her face alight and her eyes dancing, "I don't belong here
then, do I?I am never going to be old," she meditated.The Bible says we
are made in His image and likeness.Well, if that is so, how can we
ever grow old?Just think of God hobbling around in heaven with a cane
and saying: 'Well, I'm getting old now!We wouldn't grow old and die if it wasn't for our wrong
way of thinking, would we?When we think His thoughts, why, we will be
like Him.Padre Jose says this, and he knows it is
true--only, he seems to have a hard time proving it.But, Senora, we
have all got to prove it, some time, every one of us.And then there
will not be any places like this for old people--people who still
believe that two and two are seven, you know.The woman looked at her blankly; but the girl rambled on."Padre Jose
sometimes talked of the charitable institutions out in the world, and
he always said that charity was a crime against the people.And he was
right, for that is just the way Jesus looked at it, isn't it?Jesus
did not give money to beggars, but he did better, he healed them of
the bad state of mind that was making them poor and sick.Jesus, when he taught,
first said a thing, and then he turned right around and proved it.And, why, Senora,
I've had thousands of proofs!"The Sister did not reply; and Carmen, stealing a covert glance at her,
continued:

"You know, Senora, it is just as wicked to be sick and poor as it is
to tell a lie, because being sick and poor is just the ex--the
ex-ter-nal-i-zation of our thought; and such thought is not from God;
and so to hold such thoughts and to believe them real is to believe in
power apart from God.It is having other gods than the one God; and
that is breaking the very first Commandment, isn't it?Yes, it is; and
you can prove it, just as you can prove the principles in mathematics.Senora, do you know anything about mathematics?"The astonished woman made an involuntary sign of negation."Oh, Senora," cried the enthusiastic girl, "the things that Jesus
taught can be proved just as easily as we prove the rules in
mathematics!for they are truth, and all truth can be
demonstrated, you know.You know, Senora, God is everywhere--not only
in heaven, but right here where we are.Heaven, Padre Jose used to say
so often, is only a perfect state of mind; and so it is, isn't it?And when we reflect Him perfectly, why, we
will be in heaven.But," she went on after catching
her breath, "we can't reflect Him as long as we believe evil to be
real and powerful.It is just zero, nothing--"

"I've heard that before," interrupted the woman, recovering somewhat
from her surprise."But I think that before you get out of New York
you will reverse that idea.There's a pretty fair amount of evil here,
and it is quite real, we find.""If it is real, then God made it.It
seems real to you--but that is only because you give it reality in
your consciousness.You believe it real, and so it becomes to you.""Well," said the woman dryly, "on that basis I think the same may be
said of good, too.""No," answered Carmen eagerly, "good is--"

"There," interrupted the Sister coldly, holding up an admonitory hand,
"we are not going to discuss the foolish theological notions which
that fallen priest put into your poor little head.The child looked at the woman in mute protest.It was a new thought, and
one that she would not accept."Senora," she began again, after a brief interval, "Padre Jose is a
good man, even the human Padre Jose.And he is trying to solve his
problem and know God.And he is trying to know himself, not as other
people think they know him, but as God knows him, and as I have always
tried to know him.You have no right to judge him--and, anyway, you
are not judging him, but only your wrong idea of him.And that," she
said softly, "is nothing."She was beginning to feel the spell of
those great brown eyes, that soft, rich voice, and the sparkling
expression of innocence, purity, and calm assurance that bubbled from
those red lips.And she was losing herself in contemplation of the
girl's luxuriant beauty, whose rich profusion her strange, foreign
attire could not disguise."Senora," said Carmen suddenly, "the people on the boat laughed at my
clothes.But I don't think them half as funny as that great black
bonnet you are wearing.I never saw one until I
was brought here."It was said innocently, and with no thought of offense.But the woman
instantly roused from her meditation and assumed an attitude of
severe dignity."And
remember after this that children's manners here are not those of your
country."The girl fell quiet under the rebuke, and the meal ended in silence.As they were rising from the table a cheery voice came from the outer
room, and presently a priest looked in."Good morning, Sister," he cried heartily.He was a young man, apparently still in the
twenties, of athletic build, inclined rather to stoutness, and with a
round, shining face that radiated health and good nature."It is a little
waif," she said in answer to his query, "who strayed in here last
night.""Aha," said the priest, "another derelict!And will you send her to
the orphanage?""I'm afraid if I do the little heretic will corrupt all the other
children," replied the Sister."Father," she continued seriously, "I
want you to examine this child, and then tell me what you think should
be done with her.""No," replied the Sister; "but another priest has gone wrong, and
this," pointing to Carmen, "is the result of his pernicious
teachings.""Very well, Sister," he said in a low voice."I will talk with her
after the service."He seemed suddenly to have lost his cheerfulness,
as he continued to converse with the woman on matters pertaining to
the institution.Carmen, wondering and receptive, took the place assigned to her in the
chapel and sat quietly through the service.She had often seen Jose
celebrate Mass in the rude little church in Simiti, but with no such
elaboration as she witnessed here.Once or twice she joined in the
responses, not with any thought of worship, but rather to give vent,
even if slight, to the impelling desire to hear her own musical voice.She thought as she did so that the priest looked in her direction.She
thought others looked at her attentively at the same time.But they
had all stared at her, for that matter, and she had felt confused and
embarrassed under their searching scrutiny.Yet the old people
attracted her peculiarly.Never had she seen so many at one time.And
never, she thought, had she seen such physical decrepitude and
helplessness.And then she fell to wondering what they were all there
for, and what they got out of the service.Did they believe that thereby their sins were atoned?Did
they believe that that priest was really changing the wafer and wine
into flesh and blood?She recalled much that Jose had told her about
the people up in the States.They were not so different, mentally,
from her own, after all.The people, still gossiping cheerfully,
had prostrated themselves before it.The sermon had been short, for
the old people waxed impatient at long discourses.Then the priest
descended from the pulpit and came to Carmen."Now, little girl," he
said, seating himself beside her, "tell me all about yourself, who you
are, where you come from, and what you have been taught.Carmen smiled up at him; then plunged into
her narrative.It was two hours later when the Sister Superior looked in and saw the
priest and girl still sitting in earnest conversation."But," she heard the priest say, "you tell me that this
Father Jose taught you these things?""He taught me English, and French, and German.And he taught me all I know of history, and of the
world," the girl replied."Yes, yes," the priest went on hurriedly; "but these other things,
these religious and philosophical notions, who taught you these?"The Sister drew closer and strained her ears to hear.The girl looked down as she answered softly, "God."He reached out and laid a hand
on hers."I believe you," he said, in a voice scarcely audible."I
believe you--for we do not teach such things.""Then," she said quizzically,
"you are not really a priest."The Sister's voice rang sternly through the quiet
chapel."The dinner-bell
will ring in a few minutes," continued the Sister, regarding the man
severely."Ah, true," he murmured, hastily glancing at the clock."The time
passed so rapidly--a--a--this girl--"

"Leave the girl to me," replied the Sister coldly."Unless," she
added, "you consider her deranged.Coming from that hot country
suddenly into this cold climate might--"

"No, no," interrupted the priest hastily; "she seems uncommonly strong
mentally.She has some notions that are a--somewhat different from
ours--that is--but I will come and have a further talk with her."He raised his hand in silent benediction, while the Sister bowed her
head stiffly.Then, as if loath to take his eyes from the girl, he
turned and went slowly out.Carmen followed her out into the hall
and down a flight of steps to the kitchen below."Katherine," said the Sister Superior, addressing an elderly,
white-haired Sister who seemed to be in charge of the culinary
department, "put this girl to work.Let her eat with you and sleep in
your room.And see if you can't work some of the foolish notions out
of her head."CHAPTER 3


"Get some o' th' foolish notions out of your head, is it?Och, puir
bairn, wid yer swate face an' that hivenly hair, it's welcome ye air
to yer notions!Ye have talked too brash to the Sister
Superior.But, mind your tongue,
honey.Tell your funny notions to old Katie, an' they'll be safe as
the soul of Saint Patrick; but keep mum before the others, honey.""But, Senora, don't they want to know the truth up here?"There was a
note of appeal in the quavering voice."Now listen, honey; don't call me sich heathen names.I'm no Senora, whativer that may be.And as for wantin' to know the
truth, God bless ye, honey!"They don't, Sen--Sister!""Well, thin, they don't--an' mebby I'm not so far from agreein' wid
ye.But, och, it's dead beat I am, after the Sunday's work!But ye air
a right smart little helper, honey--only, ye don't belong in th'
kitchen.""Sen--I mean, Sister--"

"That's better, honey; ye'll get it in time.""Sister, I've just _got_ to find Mr."No, honey, it's few I know outside these walls.But ye can put up a
bit of a prayer when ye turn in to-night.An' we'd best be makin' for
th' bed, too, darlin', for we've a hard day's work to-morrow."It was Carmen's second night in New York, and as the girl silently
followed the puffing old woman up the several long, dark flights of
stairs to the little, cheerless room under the eaves, it seemed to her
that her brain must fly apart with the pressure of its mental
accumulation.The great building in which she was now sheltered, the
kitchen, with its marvels of equipment, gas stoves, electric lights,
annunciators, and a thousand other equally wonderful appliances which
the human mind has developed for its service and comfort, held her
fascinated, despite her situation, while she swelled with questions
she dared not ask.Notwithstanding the anxiety which she had not
wholly suppressed, her curiosity, naive, eager, and insatiable, rose
mountain high.Sister Katherine had been kind to her, had received her
with open arms, and given her light tasks to perform.And many times
during the long afternoon the old woman had relaxed entirely from her
assumed brusqueness and stooped to lay a large, red hand gently upon
the brown curls, or to imprint a resounding kiss upon the flushed
cheek.Now, as night was settling down over the great, roaring city,
the woman took the homeless waif into her big heart and wrapped her in
a love that, roughly expressed, was yet none the less tender and
sincere."Ye can ask the Virgin, honey, to send ye to yer frinds," said the
woman, as they sat in the gloaming before the window and looked out
over the kindling lights of the city."Not much, I guess, honey," answered the woman frankly."Troth, an'
I've asked her fer iverything in my time, from diamonds to a husband,
an' she landed me in a convint!"You didn't ask in the right way, Sister--"

"Faith, I asked in ivery way I knew how!An' whin I had th' carbuncle
on me neck I yelled at her!Sure she may have answered me prayer, fer
th' whoop I gave busted the carbuncle, an' I got well.Ye nivir kin
tell, honey."But, Sis--I can't call you Sister!"pleaded the girl, going to the
woman and twining her arms about her neck."Och, honey darlin'"--tears started from the old woman's eyes and
rolled down her wrinkled cheeks--"honey darlin', call me Katie, just
old Katie.Och, Holy Virgin, if I could have had a home, an' a
beautiful daughter like you--!"She clasped the girl in her great arms
and held her tightly."Katie, when you pray you must pray knowing that God has already given
you what you need, and that there is nothing that can keep you from
seeing it.""An' so, darlin', if I want
diamonds I must know that I have 'em, is it that, honey?"murmured Carmen, drawing closer, and laying her soft
cheek against the leathery visage of the old woman."Say that again, honey--och, say it again!It's words, darlin', that's
nivir been said to old Katie!""Why, hasn't any one ever been kind to you?"Och, ivirybody's kind to me, honey!But nobody has ivir loved
me--that way.The good Lord made me a fright, honey--ain't ye noticed?An' they told me from th' cradle up I'd nivir
land a man.An' I didn't, honey; they all ran from me--an' so I become
a bride o' th' Church."But, Katie, the face is nothing.Why, your heart is as big--as big as
the whole world!I hadn't been with you an hour before I knew that."Och, darlin'," murmured the woman, "sure th' Virgin be praised fer
sendin' ye to me, a lonely old woman!""It was not the Virgin, Katie, but God who brought me here," said the
girl gently, as she caressed the old Sister's cheek."It's all one, honey; the Virgin's th' Mother o' God.""Troth, child, she has th' same power as God!Don't we pray to her,
an' she prays to th' good God to save us?There is no person or thing that persuades God to be
good to His children.He is
infinite--infinite mind, Katie, and infinite good.Oh, Katie, what
awful things are taught in this world as truth!How little we know of
the great God!And yet how much people pretend they know about Him!But if they only knew--really _knew_, as Jesus did--why, Katie, there
wouldn't be an old person, or a sick or unhappy one in the whole
world!Katie," after a little pause, "I know."Air these more o' yer funny
notions, darlin'?""I suppose they are what the world thinks funny, Katie," answered the
girl.But then,
th' world moves, girlie--even old Katie sees that.Only, the Church
don't move with it.An' old Katie can see that, too.An' so, I'm
thinkin', does Father Waite.""Faith, an' how do ye know it, child?""He talked with me--a long time, this morning.He said God had taught
me what I know."Thin me own suspicions air right; he's out o' tune!Did ye say, girlie dear, that he didn't scold ye fer yer funny
notions?""No, Katie, he said they were right."Thin, lassie dear, things is goin' to happen.An' he's a
good man--troth, they make no better in this world!"Carmen looked out wonderingly over
the city.She yearned to know what it held for her."Katie," she said at length, bending again over the woman, "will you
help me find Mr."Och, lassie--what's your name again?""Carmen," replied the girl, "Carmen Ariza.""Cair-men Aree--now ain't that a name fer ye!An' I'm Scotch-Irish, honey; an' we're both a long
way from th' ol' sod!Lassie dear, tell me about last night.But, no;
begin 'way back.Old Katie's weak in th' head,
girlie, but she may see a way out fer ye.Th' Virgin help ye, puir
bairn!"Midnight boomed from the bell in a neighboring tower when Carmen
finished her story.exclaimed the old Sister, staring at the girl
in amazement."Now do ye let me feel of ye to see that ye air human;
fer only a Saint could go through all that an' live to tell it!An'
the place ye were in last night!Now be Saint Patrick, if I was rich
I'd have Masses said every day fer that Jude who brung ye here!Don't
tell me th' good Lord won't forgive her!"She's a good woman, Katie; and, somehow, I felt sorry for her, but I
don't know why.She has a beautiful home in that hotel--"

"Hotel, is it!But--och, sure, it was a hotel, honey.Only, ye air better off here wi' old Katie."But--unless it's wi' Father
Waite, I don't know what I can do.Ye air in bad with th' Sister
Superior fer yer talk at th' breakfast table.Ye're a fresh little
heathen, honey.An' she's suspicious of Father Waite, too.An' he th' best man on airth!But his doctrine ain't just sound,
sweatheart.There,
honey, lave it to me.But it's got to be done quick, or th' Sister
Superior'll have ye in an orphan asylum, where ye'll stay till ye air
soused in th' doctrine!I can manage to get word to Father Waite
to-morrow, airly.A bit of a word wi'
him'll fix it, lassie dear.An' now, honey swate, off with them funny
clothes and plump into bed.it's all but marnin' now!"A few minutes later the woman turned to the girl who lay so quiet at
her side."Honey," she whispered, "was ye tellin' me awhile back that ye knew
the right way to pray?""Yes, Katie dear," the child murmured."Thin do you pray, lass, an' I'll not trouble the Virgin this night."*       *       *       *       *

"Well, Father, what do you think now?"The Sister Superior looked up
aggressively, as Father Waite slowly entered the room.His head was
bowed, and there was a look of deep earnestness upon his face."I have talked with her again--an hour, or more," he said reflectively."She is a--a remarkable girl, in many ways.""She attracts and repels me, both," she
said.And she appears to be
suffering from religious dementia.It was a compromising question, and the priest weighed his words
carefully before replying."She does--seem to--to have rather--a--rather
unusual--religious views," said he slowly."Would it not be well to have Dr."That we may know what to do with her.If she is mentally unsound she
must not be sent to the orphanage.""She should be taken--a--I mean, we should try to locate her friends.I have already searched the city directory; but, though there are many
Reeds, there are none listed with the initials she gave me as his.I
had thought," he continued hesitatingly, "I had thought of putting her
in charge of the Young Women's Christian Association--"

"Father Waite!"The Sister Superior rose and drew herself up to her
full height."Do you mean to say that you have contemplated delivering
her into the hands of heretics?"she demanded coldly, her tall figure
instinct with the mortal pride of religious superiority."Why, Sister," returned the priest with embarrassment, "would it not
be wise to place her among those whose views harmonize more closely
with hers than ours do?"urged the man, with a gesture of
impatience.The combined weight of all the
centuries of church authority could not make her one--never!I must
take her to those with whom she rightfully belongs."The Sister Superior's eyes narrowed and glittered, and her face grew
dark.I am in charge here, and I
shall report this case to the Bishop!"The futility of his case
seemed to impress him.Taking up his hat, he bowed without speaking
and went out.Outside
the door the man listened until he caught the number she called.His
face grew dark and angry, and his hands clenched a she strode down the
hall.On the stairs that led up from the kitchen stood Sister Katherine."Wait on th' corner--behind the church!The lassie will meet you
there!"Before he could reply the woman had plunged again into the dark
stairway.Stopping at a small closet below, she took out a bundle.Then she hurried to the kitchen and summoned Carmen, who was sitting
at a table peeling potatoes."Troth, lazy lass," she commanded sharply, "do you take the bucket and
mop and begin on the front steps.And mind that ye don't bring me
heavy hand down on ye!Och, lassie darlin'," she added, when she had
drawn the startled girl out of hearing of the others, "give yer old
Katie a kiss, and then be off!Troth, it breaks me heart to see ye
go--but 'twould break yours to stay!Go, lassie darlin', an' don't
fergit old Katie!Here," thrusting the girl's bundle and a dollar bill
into her hands, "an' God bless ye, lass!Ye've won me, heart an' soul!Ye'll find a frind at th' nixt corner!"She
strained the girl again to her breast, then opened the door and
hastily thrust her out into the street.For a moment Carmen stood dazed by the suddenness of it all.She
looked up confusedly at the great, yellow building from which she had
been ejected.Then, grasping her
bundle and the dollar bill, she hurried out through the gate and
started up the street.The man's face was furrowed, and
his body trembled.The girl went up to him with a glad smile.The
priest looked up, and muttered something incoherent under his breath a
she took her hand.He drew some loose change from his pocket, and hailed an approaching
street car."To police headquarters," he replied, "to ask them to help us find
your friends."CHAPTER 4


From the mysterious wastes which lie far out on the ocean, the fog was
again creeping stealthily across the bay and into the throbbing
arteries of the great city.Through half-opened doors and windows it
rolled like smoke, and piled like drifted snow against the mountains
of brick and stone.Caught for a moment on a transient breeze, it
swirled around a towering pile on lower Broadway, and eddied up to the
windows of the Ketchim Realty Company, where it sifted through the
chinks in the loose frames and settled like a pall over the dingy
rooms within.To Philip O. Ketchim, junior member of the firm, it seemed a fitting
external expression of the heavy gloom within his soul.Crumpled into
the chair at the broad table in his private office, with his long,
thin legs stretched out before him, his hands crammed into the pockets
of his trousers, and his bullet-shaped head sunk on his flat chest,
until it seemed as if the hooked nose which graced his hawk-like
visage must be penetrating his breast-bone, the man was the embodiment
of utter dejection.On the littered table, where he had just tossed
it, lay the report of Reed and Harris on the pseudo-mineral properties
of the Molino Company--the "near-mines" in the rocky canon of the
far-off Boque.Near it lay the current number of a Presbyterian
review, wherein the merits of this now moribund project were
advertised in terms whose glitter had attracted swarms of eager,
trusting investors.The firm name of Ketchim Realty Company was something of a misnomer.The company itself was an experiment, whose end had not justified its
inception.It had been launched a few years previously by Douglass
Ketchim to provide business careers for his two sons, James and
Philip.The old gentleman, still hale and vigorous, was one of those
sturdy Englishmen who had caught the infection of '49 and abruptly
severed the ties which bound them to their Kentish homes for the
allurements of the newly discovered El Dorado of western America.Across the death-haunted Isthmus of Panama and up the inhospitable
Pacific coast the indomitable spirit of the young adventurer drove
him, until he reached the golden sands of California.There he toiled
for many years, until Fortune at length smiled upon his quenchless
efforts.Then he tossed aside his rough tools and set out for the less
constricted fields of the East.He invested his money wisely, and in the course of years turned it
several times.He aspired to the hand of a
sister of a railway president, and won it.He educated his sons in the
best colleges of the East, and then sent them to Europe on their
honeymoons.And finally, when the burden of years began to press
noticeably, and the game became less attractive, he retired from
the field of business, cleared off his indebtedness, organized the
Ketchim Realty Company, put its affairs on the best possible basis,
and then committed the unpardonable folly of turning it over to the
unrestricted management of his two sons.At the expiration of a year the old gentleman
hurried back into the harness to save the remnant of his fortune, only
to find it inextricably tied up in lands of dubious value and
questionable promotional schemes.The untangling of the real estate he
immediately took into his own hands.A word in passing regarding these sons, for they typify a form of
parasitical growth, of the fungus variety, which in these days has
battened and waxed noxious on the great stalk of legitimate commercial
enterprise.They were as dissimilar, and each as unlike his father, as
is possible among members of the same family.Both sought, with
diligent consecration, the same goal, money; but employed wholly
different means to gain that end.James, the elder, was a man of ready
wit, a nimble tongue, and a manner which, on occasions when he could
think of any one but himself, was affable and gracious.He was a
scoffer of religion, an open foe of business scruple, and the avowed
champion of every sort of artifice and device employed in ancient,
mediaeval, or modern finance to further his own selfish desires, in
the minimum of time, and at whatever cost to his fellow-man.In his
cups he was a witty, though arrogant, braggart.In his home he was
petulant and childish.Of real business acumen and constructive
wisdom, he had none.He would hew his way to wealth, if need be,
openly defiant of God, man, or the devil.Or he would work in subtler
ways, through deceit, jugglery, or veiled bribe.But he generally wore
his heart on his sleeve; and those who perforce had business relations
with him soon discovered that, though utterly unscrupulous, his
character was continuously revealed through his small conceit, which
caused him so to work as to be seen of men and gain their cheap
plaudits for his sharp, mendacious practices.Philip retained a degree of his father's confidence--which James
wholly lacked--and he spared himself no pains to cultivate it.Though
far less ready of wit than his stubby, bombastic brother, he was a
tenacious plodder, and was for this reason much more likely ultimately
to achieve his sordid purposes.His energy was tireless, and he never
admitted defeat.He never worked openly; he never appeared to have a
decided line of conduct; and no one could ever say what particular
course he intended to pursue.Apparently, he was a man of exemplary
habits; and his mild boast that he knew not the taste of tobacco or
liquor could not be refuted.He was an elder in the Presbyterian
church in the little suburb where he lived, and superintendent of its
Sunday school.His prayers were beautiful expressions of reverent
piety; and his conversation, at all times chaste and modest, announced
him a man of more than ordinary purity of thought and motive.While it
is true that no one could recall any pious deed, any charitable act,
or any conduct based on motives of self-abnegation and brotherly love
performed by him, yet no one could ever point to a single coarse or
mean action emanating from the man.If there was discord in company
affairs, the wanton James always bore the onus.And because of this,
relations between the brothers gradually assumed a condition of
strain, until at length James openly and angrily denounced Philip as a
hypocrite, and refused longer to work with him.Thereupon the milder
Philip offered the other cheek and installed a mediator, in the person
of one Rawlins, a sickly, emaciated, bearded, but loyal Hermes, who
thenceforth performed the multifold functions of pacificator,
go-between, human telephone, and bearer of messages, documents, and
what-not from one to the other for a nominal wage and the crumbs that
dropped from the promoter's table.The fog and the gloom thickened, and Ketchim sat deeply immersed in
both.He was still shaking from the fright which he had received that
morning.On opening the door as he was about to leave his house to
take the train to the city, he had confronted two bulky policemen.With a muffled shriek he had slammed the door in their astonished
faces and darted back into the house, his heart in his throat and
hammering madly.How could he know that they were only selling tickets
to a Policemen's Ball?Then he had crept to the window and, concealed
in the folds of the curtain, had watched them go down the street,
laughing and turning often to glance back at the house that held such
a queer-mannered inmate.Rousing himself from the gloomy revery into which he had lapsed,
Ketchim switched on the light and took up again the report of Reed
and Harris.Sullenly he turned its pages, while the sallow skin on his
low forehead wrinkled, and his bird-like face drew into ugly
contortions."Didn't they see that clause in their contract,
providing an additional fifty thousand in stock for them in case they
made a favorable report?"A light tap at the door, and a low cough, preceded the noiseless
entrance of the meek-souled Rawlins."A--a--this is the list which Reverend Jurges sent us--names and
addresses of his congregation.I've mailed them all descriptive
matter; and I wrote Mr.Jurges that the price of his stock would be
five dollars, but that we couldn't sell to his congregation for less
than seven.I told him Molino stock would go
up to par next month."How much stock did Jurges say he'd take?"demanded Ketchim, without
looking up."Why, he said he could only get together two thousand dollars at
present, but that later he would have some endowment insurance falling
due--"

"How soon?""About a year, I think he said.""Well, he ought to be able to borrow on that."Do so--but only hint at it.And tell him to send his check at once
for the stock he has agreed to take.""Why, he sent that some days ago.I thought you--"

"He did?"cried Ketchim, his interest now fully aroused."Er--your brother James received the letter, and I believe he put the
check in his pocket."Ketchim gave vent to a snort of rage."You tell James," he cried,
pounding the desk with his fist, "that as president and treasurer of
the Molino Company I demand that check!""Yes, sir--and--"

"Well?"Cass 'phoned before you got down this morning.He said the bank
refused to extend the time on your note."Ketchim sank back limply into his chair, and his face became ashen."And here is the mail," pursued the gentle Hermes, handing him a
bundle of letters.Ketchim roused himself with an effort."Do
you know whether James has been selling any of his own Molino stock?""I--I believe he has, sir--a little.""He sold some two hundred shares yesterday--I believe; to a Miss
Leveridge.""Why, the Leveridge children--grown men and women now--have just sold
their farm down state; and Mr.James saw the sale announced in the
papers.So he got in touch with Miss Alvina Leveridge.I believe he
sent Houghton down there; and he closed a deal.James got eight
dollars a share, I believe."Ketchim gulped down his wrath, and continued:

"How much did the Leveridges get for their farm?And why didn't you
inform me of the sale?"he demanded, fixing the humble Rawlins with a
cold eye."A--a--twenty-five thousand dollars, sir, I believe.And I didn't see
the notice until--"

"As usual, James saw it first!"James is still dickering with Miss Leveridge, I
suppose?""Nezlett got back last night, didn't he?Very well, call him up and
tell him to get ready to go at once to--wherever the Leveridges live.And--I want to see him right away!"He abruptly dismissed the factotum and turned to his mail.As his
glance fell upon the pile he gasped.Then he quickly drew out a letter
and tore it open.His thin lips moved rapidly as his eyes roved over
the paper.He laid the letter down and looked wildly about.Then he
took it up again and read aloud the closing words:

  "--and, having bought somewhat heavily of Molino stock, and
  believing that your representations were made with intent to
  deceive, I shall, unless immediate reparation or satisfactory
  explanation is made, take such steps as my counsel may advise."Yours, etc.,
                                                 "J. WILTON AMES."Congealing with fear, Ketchim took his stock memorandum from a drawer
and consulted it."He put in ten thousand, cash," he murmured, closing
the book and replacing it."And I always wondered why, for he doesn't
go into things that he can't control.He
shouldn't have been sold a dollar's worth!He knows we can't return
the money; and now he's tightening the screws!He has something up his
sleeve; and we've fallen for it!"He settled back in his chair and groaned aloud.Did
he think he'd reach Uncle Ted through us?For a
year or more he's wanted to oust Uncle from the C.& R., and now he
thinks by threatening the family with disgrace, and us fellows with
the pen, he can do it!Oh, if I ever get out of
this I'll steer clear of these deals in the future!"It was his stock
resolution, which had never borne fruit.The door opened slightly, and the noiseless Rawlins timidly announced
the arrival of Reed and Harris.cried Ketchim, jumping up and hastily passing
his hands over his hair and face.Then, advancing with a wan smile, he
courteously greeted the callers."Well, fellows," he began, waving them to seats, "it looks a
little bad for Molino, doesn't it?I've just been reading your
report--although of course you told me over the 'phone yesterday
that there was no hope.But," he continued gravely, and his face
grew serious, "I'm glad, very glad, of one thing, and that is that
there are men in the world to-day who are above temptation.""Why," continued Ketchim, smiling pallidly, "the little joker that
James inserted in the contract, about your getting fifty thousand in
the event of a favorable report.I told him it didn't look well--but
he said it would test you.He would be funny, though, no matter how
serious the business.Harris snickered; but Reed turned the conversation at once."We have
been studying how we could help you pull the thing out of the fire.Suppose you give us," he suggested, "a little of Molino's history."There isn't much to tell," replied Ketchim gloomily."The mines were
located by a man named Lakes, at one time acting-Consul at Cartagena.He came up to New York and interested
Bryan, Westler, and some others, and they asked us to act as fiscal
agents.""But you never had title to the property," said Reed."Because, on our way down the Magdalena river we made the acquaintance
of a certain Captain Pinal, of the Colombian army.When he learned
that we were mining men he told us he had a string of rich properties
that he would like to sell.I inquired their location, and he said
they lay along the Boque river.And I learned that he had clear title
to the property, too--Molino's mines.Now you have sold some three or
four hundred thousand dollars' worth of stock on alleged mines to
which you never had even the shadow of a claim!""But--" murmured Ketchim weakly, "we thought we had.We acted in good
faith--we took Mr.Lakes's word--and we showed our confidence and
sincerity by purchasing machinery to operate--"

"Oh, the machinery went down there, all right!""I judge it was designed to manufacture barrel staves, rather
than to extract gold!Lakes had it shipped to Cartagena; rented part
of an old woman's house; dumped the machinery in there; and now she's
wild.Can't get her pay from you for storing the machinery; and can't
sell the stuff, nor move it.So there she sits, under some six or
eight tons of iron junk, waiting for the Lord to perform a miracle!""But Molino has no
funds--"

"You are still selling stock, aren't you?""We would not sell any more stock
until we received your report--and not then, unless the report were
favorable.But the image of truth sat enthroned upon
Ketchim's sharp features."It is unfortunate, boys," the promoter continued dejectedly."But I
care nothing for my own losses; it's the poor stockholders I am
thinking about.I've prayed to be
led to do right."I suggest," blurted out Harris, "that, having already relieved them
considerably, you'll soon be wearing a striped suit!"The last trace of color faded from Ketchim's face, but the sickly
smile remained."I'd wear it, willingly, if by so doing I could help
these poor people," he mournfully replied."Well," pursued Harris, "it'll help some when they learn that you're
in one.""Boys," said Ketchim suddenly, quite disregarding the insinuation,
"to-morrow is Sunday, and I want you both out to dinner with me, and
we will talk this all over.Then in the afternoon I want you to come
over and see my little Sunday school.Fellows," he continued gravely,
"I've prayed for you and for your success every day since you left.And my faith in my Saviour is too great to be shattered now by your
adverse report.He certainly will show us a way out; and I can trust
him and wait."Reed and Harris looked at him and then at each other with puzzled
expressions on their faces.The man continued earnestly:

"Colombia is a rich and undeveloped country, you have said.There must
be other mineral properties available there.Did you see none on your
travels?Or could we not organize an exploration party to search for
mines?""Will your sheep stand for further shearing?""Fellows," said Ketchim, brightening and drawing his chair closer,
"you've got something--I know it!You've got something to suggest that
will save the Molino stockholders!""I shall sacrifice myself," answered Ketchim deprecatingly.His manner
had now become animated, and he leaned expectantly toward them.Reed and Harris again looked questioningly at each other."I guess we
might as well," said Reed in a low voice."It is bound to come out,
anyway.""Sure," returned Harris; "drive ahead."Ketchim," began Reed, turning to the eager, fidgeting man, "when
I came to New York a year ago, looking for a business opening, my
friend and former classmate in the University, Mr.Cass, put me in
touch with you.At that time you were booming the Molino company hard,
and, I have no doubt, thought you really had something down in
Colombia.But when you offered to lease me a portion of your
properties there, I laughed at you.And, in the course of time, I
succeeded in convincing you that you knew nothing whatsoever about the
properties on which you were selling so much stock.Then, after months
of parley, from an offer to permit me to go down to Colombia at my own
expense to examine Molino's mines, to ascertain whether or not I
wished to operate a part of them on a royalty basis, you adopted my
own view, namely, that the time had come for you to know whether the
company possessed anything of value or not.And so you sent my
associate, Mr.Harris, and myself down there to examine and report on
Molino's so-called mines.And you gave us each a block of stock as
part compensation.And now you have got to
face a body of stockholders from whom you have lured thousands of
dollars by your misrepresentations.From talks with your salesmen, I
am convinced that this body of stockholders is made up chiefly of
widows and indigent clergymen.""Which of my salesmen told you that?""Let us waive that," replied Reed calmly."The fact is, you are in a
hard way just at present, is it not so?""Fellows," said Ketchim, with an air of penitent humility, "the
officers and stockholders of the Molino Company have been grossly
deceived and unfortunately--"

"All right," interrupted Reed, "we'll pass that.But Harris and I have
played square with you.And we are going to continue to do so, and to
offer you a possible opportunity to do something for your poor
stockholders, and incidentally for yourself and us.The fact is, we do
know of another property down there, but we haven't the title--"

"That makes no difference!""I mean, it can be
acquired--" striving to restrain his eagerness."That's just the question," replied Reed."The title is at present
vested in a young Colombian girl, who, unfortunately, is lost.This
girl came up to the States with us--"

"Ha!"exclaimed Ketchim, unable longer to hold himself."Then you
broke your contract, for that stipulated that whatever you might
acquire there should belong to me!"I believe," put in Harris dryly, "we were employed by the Molino
company.""But my mother advanced the funds to send you down there!"queried Harris, with an insinuating
grin."I'm speaking for the stockholders, of course," said Ketchim,
subsiding."There is no likelihood that this poor girl will ever be heard of
again," continued Reed."Nor is it likely that the title papers, which
she has with her, will be of any use to those into whose hands she has
fallen.Her old foster-father held the title to this mine, but
transferred it to the girl, stipulating that she and I should divide a
large interest in the stock of a company formed to develop and operate
it.For my share, I agreed to bring the young girl to the States and
place her in a school, at my own expense."He went on to relate the
manner in which Carmen had been lost, and then continued: "Of course,
the title to this mine is registered in Cartagena, and in the girl's
name, as the old man gave me power to have that change made.But, now
that she is gone, the property naturally reverts to him.""No, that wouldn't be right to the old man," returned Reed."But, it
might be that the property could now be secured from him.He is old
and penniless, and without any further interest in life.It is a bare
chance, but we might prevail upon him to join us in the formation of a
company to take over his mine, La Libertad."asked Ketchim, reaching for a writing pad.Reed complied, and then continued: "Now, Mr.Ketchim, we are living
strictly up to the letter of our contract by giving you this
information.It would require not less than one hundred thousand
dollars, cash in hand, to acquire that mine, develop it, make trails,
and erect a stamp-mill.Harris and I are in no condition
financially to advance or secure such an amount.""It is barely possible," mused Harris, "that my father and Uncle John
could do something.""We don't have to call upon them!"Reed, in this mine already belongs to Molino, as you were acting under
contract with us--"

"I have covered that point, Mr."But
the time has come for us all to put our shoulders to the wheel, act
fairly with one another, help the Molino stockholders, and at the same
time make good ourselves.Harris and I have barely entered upon
our business careers, and we have come to New York to establish
ourselves.We know where this mine
is--we know the old man, and may be able to influence him.To
forestall possible complications, we should begin negotiations with
him at once.But--remember--everything must be done in the name of the
company, not in your own name.Harris and I must personally
negotiate with the old man, and receive a very liberal compensation
for our work."why didn't
you tell me this yesterday over the 'phone, and save me a night of
torment?Rawlins," he said, addressing
that individual, who had entered in response to the buzzer, "'phone
Cass to come right over.And tell Miss Honeywell to give you ten
dollars for our lunch, and charge it to Molino.Since the old man gave
you a share in the mine, Molino has property, after all!""Has it to get," amended Harris dubiously.cried Ketchim, rubbing his hands gleefully."But
now while waiting for Cass, tell me more about your trip.In the midst of the ensuing recital, Cass was announced; and Ketchim,
after detailing to him the previous conversation, launched into the
project which had been developing in his own mind while Reed had been
describing his experiences in the South."What we want is another organization, fellows," he said in
conclusion, "to take over the tottering Molino; purchase its assets
with stock; give Molino stockholders an opportunity to get in on the
ground floor, and so on.We'll let Molino die in the arms of a new
company, eh?""But one with a somewhat wider scope," suggested Cass, with an air of
importance."A sort of general development company, to secure La
Libertad, if possible; prospect for other mineral properties; and
develop the resources of the country.""Just so," assented Ketchim, with increasing enthusiasm."A company to
go in for coffee, cotton--you say you saw wild cotton, didn't you,
fellows?And cocoanuts, timber, cattle--in fact, we'll get
concessions from the Colombian Government, and we'll--"

"Just rip things wide open, eh?""Uncle Ted has influence at
Washington, with the Pan American Union, and so on--why, we can get
anything we want!Ames and the bank will both cool down--by Jove, this
is great!""But where's the cold and vulgar cash coming from to oil the wheels?""Oh, I can sell the stock," replied Ketchim."Then, too, there's the
Molino stockholders; why, I'll bet there's hardly one that wouldn't be
able to scrape up a few dollars more for the new company!By the way,
what'll we call it?"I'd call it the Salvation Company," drawled Harris, "as it is likely
to delay your trip to Sing Sing."A general laugh, in which Ketchim joined heartily, followed the
remark."I suggest we call it the Simiti Development Company," said Cass,
after a moment's dignified reflection."If these gentlemen can acquire that mine, I
think I would capitalize for, say, about three millions."He went to
the desk and made some calculations."I assume," he continued somewhat
pompously after a few moments' figuring, "that you wish to retain me,
and that I am to take my compensation in stock?"He knew that Cass had correctly concluded
that in no other way was he likely to be reimbursed.And, at best, it
was only a hazard, a wild gamble.In fact, it was a last desperate
chance.Moreover, stock was always available; while cash was a rare
commodity."Suppose, then," continued the sapient young lawyer, "that we
capitalize for three millions; set aside one million, five hundred and
one thousand as treasury stock, to be sold to raise money for
development purposes; transfer to the Ketchim Realty Company one
million, as compensation for acting as fiscal agents of the new
company; transfer to these two gentlemen, as part compensation for
past and future services, the sum of four hundred thousand in stock;
give to the stockholders of the Molino Company the sum of fifty-nine
thousand in stock for all the assets, machinery, good will, _et
cetera_, of that company; and to me, for services to be rendered,
forty thousand dollars' worth of the stock.All of us shall agree not
to sell any of our personal holdings of stock until the company shall
be placed upon a dividend-paying basis.Harris,
or both, will return to Colombia immediately to relocate the mine, and
prepare for its development, while the Ketchim Realty Company at once
endeavor to sell the treasury stock."Having delivered himself of this comprehensive plan, Cass settled back
in his chair and awaited remarks."Well," observed Ketchim at length, "that's all right--only, I think
we should be allowed to sell our personal stock if we wish.Of
course," with a deprecating wave of his hand, "there isn't the
slightest likelihood of our ever wanting to do that--with a mine such
as you have described, fellows."Not one dollar's worth of your stock shall you be permitted to sell!"cried Harris, bringing his fist down upon the desk."I suggest that we leave that for the Directors to decide later,"
offered Cass, anxious to avoid discord.He was young, scarcely out of
the twenties, just married, just admitted to the bar, and eager to get
a toe-hold in the world of business."And now," he concluded, "if
agreeable to you, I will put this through at once, organize the
company, and get the charter.You gentlemen will return to Colombia as
soon as Mr.Harris and I have formed an engineering partnership," said Reed."As such, we will handle the affairs of the new company in Colombia.Harris will proceed to that country, while I go to California to
open a copper mine which we have taken over there."I'll send Houghton and Nezlett out on the road to-morrow.Rawlins
has just told me of one prospect, a bully one!We don't need to
wait for the papers from Albany before going ahead.But we find it
costs about forty-eight cents to sell a dollar's worth of stock, and
so some time will be needed to raise enough to send Mr.Harris back
to Colombia--unless," he added, eying Harris furtively, "he will
advance us the amount of his own expenses--"

"Which he will not!""There's a revolution on down there now," said Reed, "and we'd better
go easy for a while.Besides, Harris needs time to study the language.But, are we all agreed on the terms?Salary for Harris while in
Colombia to be settled later, of course.""It's all satisfactory, I think," said Ketchim, smiling happily."The
details can be worked out anon--Molino stockholders' meeting, and so
on.""Then," said Reed, rising, "we will consider the new company launched,
to take over the defunct Molino and to operate on a comprehensive
scale in Colombia, beginning with the development of La Libertad, if
we can secure it."At that moment Rawlins opened the door and peered in.Reed," he announced softly; "a priest, I believe."The door swung open, and Father Waite
entered with Carmen.With a glad cry the girl dropped her bundle and bounded into the arms
of the astonished Harris.Reed grasped the priest's hand, and begged
him to speak.Ketchim and the young lawyer looked on in perplexity."I was unable to find your name in the city directory, Mr.Reed,"
explained the priest, his face beaming with happiness."But at police
headquarters I found that you had made inquiries, and that detectives
were searching for the girl.I learned that you were living with your
wife's sister, and that you had no business address, having just come
up from South America.So I telephoned to your sister-in-law, and your
wife informed me that you had an appointment this morning at this
office.I therefore came directly here with the girl, who, as you see,
is safe and sound, but with an additional interesting experience or
two to add to the large fund she already possessed."He looked down at
Carmen and smiled."And now," he concluded, laughing, as he prepared
to depart, "I will not ask for a receipt for the child, as I see I
have several witnesses to the fact that I have delivered her to the
proper custodian."cried Reed, seizing him by the hand.We
want to know you--"

"I will give you my card," replied the priest."And I would be very
happy, indeed, if some time again I might be permitted to see and talk
with the little girl."He handed his card to Reed; then nodded and
smiled at Carmen and went out.sputtered Harris, pushing the girl aside and making after
him.The priest had already caught a descending
elevator, and disappeared."I
guess that knocks the Simiti Company sky-high," he exclaimed, "for
here is the sole owner of La Libertad!"Ketchim collapsed into a chair, while Reed, saying that he would keep
his dinner engagement with Ketchim on the following day, picked up
Carmen's precious bundle and, taking her hand, left the room."I am
going home," he called back to Harris; "and you be sure to come up to
the house to-night.We'll have to readjust our plans now."CHAPTER 5


"Reed," said Harris the following day, as they sat in the dusty,
creaking car that was conveying them to their dinner appointment with
Ketchim, "who is this Ames that Ketchim referred to yesterday?"The men were not alone, for Carmen accompanied them.Reed was
reluctantly bringing her at the urgent request received from Ketchim
over the telephone the previous evening.But the girl, subdued by the
rush of events since her precipitation into the seething American
world of materialism, sat apart from them, gazing with rapt attention
through the begrimed window at the flying scenery, and trying to
interpret it in the light of her own tenacious views of life and the
universe.If the marvels of this new world into which she had been
thrown had failed to realize her expectations--if she saw in them, and
in the sense of life which they express, something less real, less
substantial, than do those who laud its grandeur and power to
charm--she gave no hint.She was still absorbing, sifting and
digesting the welter of impressions.She had been overpowered,
smothered by the innovation; and she now found her thoughts a tangled
jumble, which she strove incessantly to unravel and classify according
to their content of reality, as judged by her own standards."Why, Ames," replied Reed, turning a watchful eye upon Carmen, "is a
multimillionaire financier of New York--surely you have heard of him!He and his clique practically own the United States, and a large
slice of Europe.For some reason Ames bought a block of Molino stock.And now, I judge, Ketchim would give his chances on eternal life if he
hadn't sold it to him.And that's what's worrying me, too.For, since
Ames is heavily interested in Molino, what will he do to the new
company that absorbs it?""There isn't going to be any new company," asserted Harris doggedly."Ketchim holds us strictly to our
contract.Our negotiations with old Rosendo were made while in the
employ of Molino.It wouldn't be so bad if we had only Ketchim to deal
with.We've got the goods on him and could beat him.But here enters
Ames, a man of unlimited wealth and influence.If he wants La
Libertad, he's going to get it, you mark me!Where we fell down was in
ever mentioning it to Ketchim.For if we don't come over now he will
lay the whole affair before Ames.He told me over the 'phone last
night that he was badly in debt--that Ames was pressing him--that many
of the Molino stockholders were making pertinent inquiries.And yesterday I saw on his desk a letter from
Ames.Ketchim would sacrifice us and
everything else to keep himself out of Ames's grip.We're in for it, I
tell you!And all because we were a bit too previous in believing that
the girl had disappeared for good."exclaimed Harris, "but doesn't it sound like a fairy-tale,
the way Carmen got back to us?""And here I am," continued Reed, with a gesture of vexation, "left
with the girl on my hands, and with a very healthy prospect of losing
out all around.My wife said emphatically last night that she wouldn't
be bothered with Carmen.""But do you realize
that that involves expense?I'm a comparatively poor man, just getting
a start in my profession, and with a young and socially ambitious
wife!""But--your wife--er, she's going to--to have money some day, isn't
she?"But the grim reaper has a little work to do first.And on
occasions like this he's always deucedly deliberate, you know.Meantime, we're skating close to the edge--for New Yorkers.""Well, we may be able to beat Ketchim.Now, my father and Uncle
John--"

"Oh, shoot your father and Uncle John!"The conductor opened the door and bawled a cryptical announcement."This is the place," said Reed, starting up and making for the door."And now you rake your thought for some way to deal with Ketchim.And
leave your father and Uncle John entirely out of the conversation!"Ketchim was just bowing out a caller as the young engineers mounted
the steps.he exclaimed, after giving them a hearty
welcome."I just sold him a hundred shares of Simiti stock, at five
dollars a share--just half of par."But--" protested Harris, as they entered the spacious parlor, "the
company isn't even in existence yet--and hasn't an asset!""Oh, that's all right," replied Ketchim easily."It's coming into
existence, and will have the grandest mine in South America!Boys," he
went on earnestly, "I've been talking over the 'phone with Mr.Ames,
our most influential stockholder, and a very warm friend of mine.I
told him about our conversation of yesterday.He says, go right ahead
with the new company--that it's a great idea.He's satisfied with his
present holding, and will not increase it.Says he wants Molino
stockholders to have the opportunity to purchase all the treasury
stock, if they want to.""Decidedly magnanimous," returned Reed."But--what about the basis of
organization of the new company?""Leave it as we planned it, he says.He thinks the arrangement and
division of stock fine!"Reed and Harris looked at each other questioningly."But," went on Ketchim, "have you seen the morning papers?They are
full of the revolution in Colombia.The country is torn wide open,
and reports say nothing can be done down there until peace is
restored--and that may take a year or two.But, meantime, we will go
ahead and organize the new company and take over Molino and prepare
to begin work just as soon as you fellows can get into that country.And so this," going to
Carmen and taking her hand, "is the wonderful little girl!Ketchim and her troop of children at this
juncture interrupted the conversation."All enthusiastic Simiti
stockholders," said Ketchim, waving his hand toward them, after the
introductions."And all going to get rich out of it, too--as well as
yourselves, boys.It simply shows how Providence works--one with God
is a majority, always."Carmen glanced up at him wonderingly.Dinner over, the men were left alone.Carmen had been taken upstairs
by the children to the nursery."I've got myself slated for the presidency of the new company," said
Ketchim, plunging again into the subject nearest his heart; "and I
think we'd better put brother James in as vice-president.Perfectly
safe," looking at Harris and winking."He's got to be recognized, you
know, since the Ketchim Realty Company act as fiscal agents.Now for
directors I've put down Judge Harris, your father--that's to assure
you boys that there'll be some one to look after your interests.Then
we'll say Reverend Jurges for another.He's got a big congregation and
will be able to place a lot of stock.You just ought to see the letter
he wrote me about selling stock to his people!You'd never believe he
was a good, spiritually-minded clergyman, with an eye single to
heavenly riches!Then one of you fellows, say Reed, had better go on
the directorate, since Harris will be in Colombia in charge of
operations.He's young and immature, but
absolutely square.He'll do all the legal work for his stock interest."But what do I do while we are waiting?"asked Harris in some
perplexity."Reed goes to California right away, you know.""That's all right, old man," Ketchim genially assured him."The new
company will be organized at once--this week, if possible.You go on
salary from the moment of its incorporation, and you open your office
right here in this building.I'll see that the rent is paid until you
go back to Colombia.Everything's arranged, and you turn right in and
help Cass with the new company.You've got
to prepare circulars; write boosting letters to stockholders and
prospects; follow up leads; and--oh, you'll be busy!But here comes
Reverend Coles," looking out of the window as a man came up the steps."He's interested in some projects I've been exploiting.He hastened out to greet the visitor and conducted him into a back
room.Reed and Harris were left to the contemplation of their own
mixed thoughts.Presently Harris, whose eyes had been dilating
for some moments, broke out in a hoarse whisper: "Listen!God
a'mighty!--he's praying!"He got up softly and approached the door of the room into which
Ketchim had taken his caller.In a few minutes he returned to his
chair."I could see Ketchim through the
keyhole, on his knees by the bed, praying with that fellow!Through the silence that fell upon
them snatches of the prayer being offered in the adjoining room
floated to their ears--"O, blessed Saviour, vouchsafe prosperity to
our venture, we beseech thee!The earth is the Lord's, and the
fullness thereof--we ask thy blessing on these efforts of ours to
wrest from the ground the wealth which the Father of lights has
deposited there for the benefit of His children--"

Harris snickered aloud."It may not be a game," he replied."But if it is, it's an old one, hiding behind the mask of religion.But I'm inclined to believe the man sincere."I
know James to be an out-and-out rascal--he openly flies the black
flag.But this pious fellow--well, he's got me guessing!"The caller soon departed, and Ketchim again joined the young men."He's our assistant pastor," he said musingly, as he watched the man
go down the walk."Nice young fellow, waiting for a church.He and
some of his friends are interested in a zinc mine we've been floating,
down in the Joplin district."queried the cynical Harris, with a twinkle in his eyes."Oh, yes," Ketchim smiled affably.Lots of development work to be done, you know.And there's a lot of water in this mine.""And in the stock, too, eh?""We haven't struck the deposit yet, although we expect to soon.But,"
glancing up at the clock on the mantel, "we'll have to be going over
to Sunday school now.And I want that little girl to go with Marjorie.Fellows," the man's face became deeply serious, "I have no doubt you
are both church members?"Reed fidgeted uneasily under Ketchim's searching glance; but Harris
frankly met the question."Nope," he asserted, "we're both rank
heathen.And I'm a dyed-in-the-wool atheist."cried Ketchim, "how can you say that, when you see the
goodness of the Lord on every hand?""Reed, I believe," continued the imperturbable Harris, waving a hand
toward his friend, "has philosophical leanings--New Thought,
Subliminal Consciousness, Power in Silence, and all that."But surely you believe in the divinity of the Christ?""Well, as a matter of fact, I never gave it much thought," said
Harris."Ah, that's what so many say," replied Ketchim sadly; "and then comes
the awful voice of the Lord, 'This night thy soul shall be required of
thee!'Fellows, I want to pray for you; and I want you both to promise
me that you will take up seriously the consideration of your souls'
welfare.It's too grave a subject for jest," addressing himself
solemnly to the grinning Harris."All right, old man," laughed Harris."But don't dig up any
Presbyterian tracts for me.I've got a living witness to--well, to
something out of the ordinary, in that girl, Carmen, and I'm inclined
to believe she's dug nearer to bottom facts than any of you.So when
I'm ready to discuss my soul's welfare I'll just consult her, see?""That reminds me," said Ketchim, turning abruptly to Reed, "what do
you intend to do with the girl?""_Quien sabe?_" Reed answered abstractedly."Send her to a boarding
school, I guess.At least, that's what I told the old man I'd do.""So you said before," Ketchim returned.My daughter Marjorie leaves Tuesday
for Conway-on-the-Hudson, where she has been attending Madam Elwin's
Select School for Girls.Suppose you go with her--I'm too busy,
myself--and take Carmen.It's only a few hours' ride by boat down the
river.This is Marjorie's third year
there, and she's simply in love with it."Reed began to show signs of interest; and Ketchim, noting the effect
of his words, went on briskly:

"Now look here, Molino owes its salvation, and the new company its
existence, to that girl.Why shouldn't they do something to show their
gratitude?I say, it is no more than right that the new company should
support her while she is in school."not a half-bad idea," commented Harris."Certainly not," continued Ketchim earnestly."Now fix up everything
with her as regards the transfer of the mine to the new company, and
then let her go with Marjorie to the Elwin school.We can, if you
like, make some agreement with her to the effect that when the company
is on its feet and she is receiving dividends, she shall return what
it may advance for her schooling, eh?""You'd better accept the suggestion, Reed," put in Harris."I'll be
here, you know, to keep an eye on the girl; and I'll take her and
Marjorie down to Conway myself, and attend to getting her located
right."He was hardly in a position to refuse such
an offer.Besides, he was really leaving her in charge of Harris."Well," he said at length, "in that case I could leave for California
to-morrow night.That matter is pressing hard--all right, I accept the
company's offer.It's no more than is due the girl, anyway.""I'll make the necessary arrangements at
once.Thus it was that two days later Carmen, still wondering if she was
dreaming, was enrolled in the Elwin Select School for Girls, with
Marjorie Ketchim for roommate; while Reed, on the Overland Limited,
hurrying to the far West, was musing dubiously at frequent intervals
on Ketchim's rather conflicting statements, which, until left to this
enforced leisure, he had not had time to try to reconcile.At the same
time, while Harris was loudly declaiming to the gracious Madam Elwin
on the astonishing mental prowess of the girl, Ketchim and Cass sat
deeply immersed in the tentative plans for the newly-projected Simiti
Development Company."Now listen," said Ketchim, who for some minutes had been quietly
scanning his youthful lawyer, "Ames knows nothing about the formation
of this company, but Harris and Reed are not to know that; and we're
going to keep Ames in ignorance of all our plans.With the first sales
of stock--and they've already begun--we'll return him his Molino
investment.Nezlett wired me this morning that he's sure to sell a big
block to the Leveridges, that they're mightily interested, and want to
meet Carmen.We'll use the girl for just such purposes.That's one
reason why I wanted her handy, so's we could reach her at any time.She makes a star impression; and with her as an advertisement we'll
sell a million dollars' worth of stock, and no trouble at all!She's
got that honest look that's convincing.And she can tell a story that
beats the Arabian Nights!Ames has given me a week to explain, or make
good his investment.By that time we'll have the Leveridges sold for
twice his investment, and we'll just pay him off and remove him.Meantime, you go over to the bank in the morning and put up the best
line of talk you're capable of.I've got sixteen hundred dollars to
give 'em on that note; and that'll secure more time, until the sales
of stock are enough to pay it all up.Perhaps Uncle Ted will advance
me enough to take up the note when he hears about La Libertad.And,
say, you see brother James, and shake the club over him until he
disgorges that check he got from Miss Leveridge.You can hand him a
scare that he won't get over.things have taken a
great turn, eh?Why, I can just see Simiti stock sales humping these
next few months.Oh, Miss Honeywell," calling to his cashier, "bring
me five dollars, please, and charge it to Molino--I mean, to Simiti.Then, again addressing Cass: "Come
with me to the football game this afternoon.We can discuss plans
there as well as here.Gee whiz, but I feel great!"CHAPTER 6


Carmen's rapid transition from the eternal solitudes of Guamoco to the
whirring activities of New York was like a plunge into the maelstrom,
and left her groping blindly in the effort to adapt herself to the
changed order.There was little in her former mode of existence that
could be transferred to her new environment, and she felt that she was
starting life like a new-born babe.For days, even weeks, she moved
about dreamily, absorbed, ceaselessly striving to orient herself and
to accept easily and naturally the marvels, the sudden accession of
material aids, and the wonders of this modern, complex civilization,
so common to her associates, but scarcely even dreamed of by her in
her former home, despite the preparation which Jose had tried to give
her.The Elwin school was small, its student-body seldom numbering
more than fifty, and in it Carmen found herself hedged about by
restrictions which in a way were beneficial, in that they narrowed her
environment and afforded her time for her slow adjustment to it.But if these restrictions aided her, they also rendered the length of
her stay in the school almost calculable.Little by little the girl
saw the forces developing which she knew must effect her dismissal;
little by little, as Madam Elwin's manner toward her became less
gracious, and her schoolmates made fewer efforts to conceal from her
the fact that she was not one of them, Carmen prepared for the
inevitable.Six months after the girl's enrollment, Madam Elwin
terminated her series of disparaging reports to Ketchim by a request
that he come at once and remove his charge from the school.Ketchim, the girl is a paradox.And
after these months of disappointing effort to instruct her, I am
forced to throw up my hands in despair and send for you."Madam Elwin
tapped nervously with a dainty finger upon the desk before her."But, if I may be permitted the question, what specific reasons have
you, Madam, for--ah, for requesting her removal?"William Jurges, who, having come up to the city to
attend a meeting of the directors of the Simiti company, had accepted
Ketchim's invitation to first accompany him on his flying trip to
Conway-on-the-Hudson, in response to Madam Elwin's peremptory
summons."Because," replied that worthy personage with a show of exasperation, "I
consider her influence upon the young ladies here quite detrimental.Our school, while non-sectarian, is at least Christian.Where she got her views, I can not imagine.At first she made
frequent mention of a Catholic priest, who taught her in her home town,
in South America.But of late she has grown very reserved--I might say,
sullen, and talks but little.Her views, however, are certainly not
Catholic.She refuses to
accept a large part of our instruction.Her answers to examination
questions are wholly in accord with her peculiar views, and hence quite
apart from the texts.For that reason she fails to make any grades,
excepting in mathematics and the languages.She utterly refuses to
accept any religious instruction whatsoever.She would not be called
atheistic, for she talks--or used to at first--continually about God.But her God is not the God of the Scriptures, Dr.She is a
free-thinker, in the strictest sense.And as such, we can not
consent to her remaining longer with us.""Ah--quite so, Madam, quite so," returned the clergyman, in his
unconsciously pompous manner."Doubtless the child's thought
became--ah--contaminated ere she was placed in your care.But--ah--I
have heard so much from our good friend, Mr.Ketchim, regarding this
young girl, that--ah--I should like exceedingly to see and talk with
her--if it might be--ah--"

"Madam Elwin will arrange that, I am sure," interposed Ketchim."Suppose," he suggested, addressing the lady, "we let him talk with
her, while I discuss with you our recently acquired mine in South
America, and the advisability of an investment with us.""Certainly," acquiesced Madam Elwin, rising and pressing one of the
several buttons in the desk."Bring Miss Carmen," she directed, to the
maid who answered the summons.Jurges; "but may I go to her?Ah--it
would doubtless be less embarrassing for the child.""Miss Carmen was in the chapel a few moments ago," volunteered the
maid."Then take the doctor there," returned Madam Elwin, with a gesture of
dismissal.At the head of the stairway the mingled sounds of a human voice and
the soft, trembling notes of an organ drifted through the long hall
and fell upon the ears of the clergyman."Miss Carmen," said the maid, answering his unspoken thought."She
often comes up to the chapel and sings for hours at a time--alone.The
chapel is down there," pointing to the end of the hall."Then--ah--leave me," said the doctor.The maid turned willingly and went below, while the man tiptoed to
the chapel door.The girl was
singing in Spanish, and he could not understand the words.But they
would have meant nothing to him then.It was the voice upon which
they were borne that held him.The song was a weird lament that had
come down to the children of Simiti from the hard days of the
_Conquistadores_.It voiced the untold wrongs of the Indian slaves;
its sad, unvarying minor echoed their smothered moans under the
cruel goad; on the plaintive melody of the repeated chorus their
piteous cries were carried to heaven's deaf ears; their dull despair
floated up on the wailing tones of the little organ, and then died
away, as died the hope of the innocent victims of Spanish lust.The reverend doctor had never heard a song of that kind before.Nor
could he readily associate the voice, which again and again he could
not distinguish from the flute-like tones of the organ, with the
sordidness and grime of material, fleshly existence.He entered softly
and took a seat in the shadow of a pillar.The clear, sweet voice of
the young girl flowed over him like celestial balm.Some were dreamy bits and snatches in Spanish and English;
others were sacred in character.He wondered deeply, as the girl mused
over these; yet he knew not that they were her own compositions.Curiosity and uncertainty mastered him at length, and he got softly to
his feet and moved away from the pillar, that he might see from what
manner of being issued such unbroken harmony.But in his eagerness his
foot struck a chair, and the sound echoed loudly through the room.The music abruptly ceased, and the girl rose and looked over the organ
at the intruder."I--I beg your pardon," said the clergyman, advancing in some
embarrassment."I was listening to your singing--uninvited, but none
the less appreciative.I--"

"Wait, please!"cried the girl, hastily stooping over and fumbling
with her shoes.The doctor laughed genially, as he grasped the
situation."I took them off," she explained hurriedly."I am not yet accustomed
to them.I never wore shoes until I left Simiti."Her face was
scarlet, and she tried to cover her confusion with a little laugh.The doctor stood staring at her, lost in admiration of the shapely
figure, the heavy, curling hair, and the wonderfully expressive face.The girl quickly recovered her poise and returned him a frank smile.she said, after waiting in vain for him to
begin."Ah--a--yes, certainly--that is, I beg your pardon," stammered the
doctor."I did request permission of Madam Elwin to make your
acquaintance.I am Doctor Jurges, an
Episcopal clergyman."His sentences issued like blasts from an engine
exhaust."I am Carmen Ariza," said the girl, extending her hand."Ah--quite so, quite so," blustered the doctor, clearing his throat
noisily.Ah--ah--you have a remarkable voice.And my poor organ-playing is what I have
picked up myself these six months."The girl looked up into his face searchingly."Why," she asked,
"should every one up here think it remarkable when a human mind is
clear enough to be a transparency for God?"Had the roof fallen, the excellent doctor could have been no more
startled.He cleared his throat violently again; then fumbled
nervously in his pocket and drew out his glasses.These he poised upon
the ample arch of his ecclesiastical nose, and through them turned a
penetrating glance upon the girl.yes," said he at length; "quite so, quite so!And--ah--Miss
Carmen, that brings us to the matter in question--your religious
instruction--ah--may I ask from whom you received it?""From God," was the immediate and frank reply.The clergyman started, but quickly recovered his equipoise.But--your religious views--I believe they are not
considered--ah--quite evangelical, are they?By your present
associates, that is.""No," she replied, with a trace of sadness in her tone."But," looking
up with a queer little smile, "I am not persecuting them for that.""Oh, no," with a jerky little laugh.I judge the
persecution has come from the other side, has it not?""We will not speak of that," she said quickly."They do not
understand--that is all."no, quite so--that is--ah--may I ask why you think they do not
understand?"If that which I believe is not true," the girl replied evenly, "it
will fail under the test of demonstration.Their beliefs have long
since failed under such test--and yet they still cling jealously to
them, and try to force them upon all who disagree with them.I am a
heretic, Doctor.""H'm--ah--yes, I see.But--it is a quite unfortunate characteristic
of mankind to attribute one's views indiscriminately to the
Almighty--and--ah--I regret to note that you are not wholly free from
this error.""You do not understand, I think," she quickly returned."I put every
view, every thought, every idea to the test.If good is the result, I
know that the thought or idea comes from the source of all good, God.The views I hold are those which I have time and again tested--and
some of them have withstood trials which I think you would regard as
unusually severe."Her thought had rested momentarily upon her vivid
experience in Banco, the dangers which had menaced her in distant
Simiti, and the fire through which she had passed in her first hours
in Christian America, the land of churches, sects, and creeds.the worthy doctor mused, regarding the girl first through his
spectacles, and then over the tops of them, while his bushy eyebrows
moved up and down with such comicality that Carmen could scarcely
refrain from laughing.Ah--suppose you relate to me
some of the tests to which your views have been subjected.""No," she returned firmly; "those experiences were only states of
consciousness, which are now past and gone forever.Why go back now and give them the
appearance of reality?"H'm--then you do not regard untoward experience as given us
by God for the testing of our faith, I take it."Carmen turned her head away with a little sigh of weariness."I
think," she said slowly, "I think we had better not talk about these
things, Doctor."Why--ah," blustered the clergyman, assuming a more paternal air,
"we--ah--would not for a moment cause you embarrassment, Miss Carmen!But--in fact, Madam Elwin has--ah--expressed her disapproval of your
views--your religious ideals, if I may put it so baldly, and she--that
is--the good lady regrets--"

"She wishes to be rid of me, you mean, Doctor?"said the girl,
turning and stretching a mental hand to the sinking divine.well, hardly so--ah--so--"

"Doctor," said the girl calmly, "I know it, and I wish to go.I have
been waiting only to see the way open.I do not wish to remain longer
in an atmosphere where ignorance and false belief stifle all real
progress."The doctor turned another look of astonishment upon her.He had
forgotten that he had not been talking with one of his own age.But if her clear mental gaze
penetrated the ecclesiastical mask and surmounted the theological
assumptions of her interlocutor, enabling her to get close to the
heart of the man, she did not indicate it further."I am nearly
sixteen," was her only reply."Ah," he reflected, "just a child!My dear girl," he continued, laying
a hand indulgently upon hers, "I will advise with Madam Elwin, and
will endeavor to convince her that--ah--that your spiritual welfare,
if I may so put it, requires that you be not turned adrift at this
critical, transitorial period of your life.We must all be patient,
while we strive to counteract the--ah--the pernicious teaching to
which you were exposed before--ah--before becoming enrolled in this
excellent school."Carmen looked at him steadily for a moment before replying.There was
something of pity in the expression of her beautiful face, of tender
sympathy for those who seek the light, and who must some day find it,
but whose progress is as yet hampered by the human mind's unreasoning
adherence to the stepping-stones over which it has been passing
through the dark waters of ignorance."Then, Doctor," she said calmly,
"you know what I have been taught?""Why--ah--yes--that is, vaguely.He was beginning to be sensible of having passed judgment upon the
girl without first according her a hearing."Well," she smiled up at him, "I have been taught the very hardest
thing in the whole world."He again clutched at his mental poise.But--ah--is it not the function of all our schools to teach
us to think?""No," answered the girl decidedly; "not to teach us to think, but to
cause us blindly to accept what is ignorantly called 'authority'!I
find we are not to reason, and particularly about religious matters,
but to accept, to let those 'in authority' think for us.Are you not even now seeking to make me accept your religious views?Oh, no; but because you believe them
true--whether they are or not.Do your religious views rest upon anything
but the human mind's undemonstrated interpretation of the Bible?And
yet you can not prove that interpretation true, even though you would
force it upon such as I, who may differ from you.""I--ah--" began the doctor nervously.But Carmen continued without
heeding the interruption:

"Only yesterday Professor Bales, of the University, lectured here on
'The Prime Function of Education.'He said it was the development of
the individual, and that the chief end of educational work was the
promotion of originality.And yet, when I think along original
lines--when I depart from stereotyped formulae, and state boldly that I
will not accept any religion, be it Presbyterian, Methodist, or Roman
Catholic, that makes a God of spirit the creator of a man of flesh, or
that makes evil as real as good, and therefore necessarily created and
recognized by a God who by very necessity can not know evil--then I am
accused of being a heretic, a free-thinker; and the authorities take
steps to remove me, lest my influence contaminate the rest of the
pupils!""H'm--ah--yes, quite so--that is--I think--"

"Do you, a preacher, think?""Or do you
only _think_ that you think?Do you still believe with the world that
the passing of a stream of human thought, or a series of mental
pictures, through your mentality constitutes _real_ thinking?Do you
believe that jumping from one human mental concept to another
twenty-four hours a day constitutes thinking?Have you yet learned to
distinguish between God's thoughts and their opposites, human
thoughts?Have you a real, working,
demonstrable knowledge of Christianity?Do you heal the sick, raise
the dead, and preach the truth that sets men free from the mesmerism
of evil?If so, then you are unevangelical, too, and you and I are
both heretics, and we'd better--we'd better leave this building at
once, for I find that the Inquisition is still alive, even in
America!"Her face was flushed, and her
whole body quivered with emotion.Why, my dear young lady, this is a Christian
nation!""Then," said the girl, "you have still much to learn from the pagan
nations that have gone before."exclaimed the doctor, again adjusting his glasses
that he might see her more clearly."My dear child, you have been
thinking too much, and too seriously.""No, Doctor," she replied; "but you preachers have not been thinking
enough, nor even half seriously.Oh," she went on, while her eyes grew
moist, and ever and again her throat filled, "I had expected so much
in this great country!And I have found so little--so little that is
not wholly material, mechanical, and unreal!I had imagined that, with
all your learning and progress, which Padre Jose told me about, you
would know God much better than we in the darkened South.But your god
is matter, machinery, business, gold, and the unreal things that can
be bought with money.Some one wrote, in a recent newspaper, that
America's god was'mud and mammon!'What do I find the girls here in
this school talking about but dress, and society, and the unreal,
passing pleasures of the physical senses!There are religious services here every
Sunday, and sermons by preachers who come down from the city.Sometimes a Baptist; sometimes a Presbyterian; and sometimes an
Episcopalian, or a Methodist.Each has a different concept of God; yet they all believe
Him the creator of a man of flesh and bones, a man who was originally
made perfect, but who fell, and was then cursed by the good and
perfect God who made him.Oh, what childish views for men to hold and
preach!How could a good God create anything that could fall?And if
He could, and did, then He knew in advance that the man would fall,
and so God becomes responsible, not man.Oh, Doctor, is it possible
that you believe such stuff?Is it any
wonder that, holding such awful views, you preachers have no longer
the power to heal the sick?Do you not know that, in order to heal the
sick, one must become spiritually-minded?But no one who holds to the
puerile material beliefs embraced in your orthodox theology can
possibly be spiritual enough to do the works Jesus said we should all
do if we followed him--really understood him.""My dear child--you really are quite inconsistent--you--"

"Inconsistent!What a charge for an orthodox preacher to bring!Let us
see: You say that the Scriptures teach that God made man in His image
and likeness--the image and likeness of spirit.Spirit,
God, is eternal, immortal.Then while He exists can His image fade
away, or die?Can or would God cause it to do so?Can or would He
destroy His own reflection?And could that image, always being like
Him, ever change, or manifest sin, or disease, or evil, unless God
first manifested these things?And if God did manifest them, then,
perforce, the image would _have_ to do likewise.But, in that case,
could God justly punish His image for faithfully reflecting its
original?Oh, it is you preachers, lacking sufficient
spirituality to correctly interpret the Scriptures, who are wildly,
childishly, ignorantly inconsistent!"Carmen rose and faced the clergyman."I did not mean to condemn
you, Doctor," she said earnestly."I wage no warfare with persons
or things.My opposition is directed only against the entrenched human
thought that makes men spiritually blind and holds them in the
mesmeric chains of evil.I am young, as you reckon years, but I
have had much experience in the realm of thought--and it is there
that all experience is wrought out before it becomes externalized.I have told you, my teacher was God.He used as a channel a priest,
who came years ago to my little home town of Simiti, in far-off
Colombia.His life had been wrecked by holding to the belief of
evil as a power, real and intelligent.He began to see the light; but
he did not overcome fear sufficiently to make his demonstration and
break the imaginary bonds which held him.He saw, but he did not
prove.And, Doctor, you and everybody else will
have to do the same.For, unless Jesus uttered the most malicious
falsehoods ever voiced, every human being will have to take every
step that he took, make every demonstration that he made, and prove
all that he proved, before mortals will cease to consume with
disease, perish miserably in accidents, and sink with broken lives
into graves that do _not_ afford a gateway to immortal life!My God is
infinite, eternal, unchanging mind.The god of the preachers,
judging from their sermons preached here, is a human, mental
concept, embodying spirit and matter, knowing good and evil, and
changing with every caprice of their own unstable mentalities.My
religion is the Christianity of the Master, love.Oh, how this poor
world needs it, yearns for it!The love that demonstrates the
nothingness of evil, and drives it out of human experience!The love
that heals the sick, raises the dead, binds up broken hearts!The
love that will not quench the religious instincts of children, and
falsely educate them to know all manner of evil; but that teaches
them to recognize it for what it is, the lie about God, and then
shows them how to overcome it, even as Jesus did.Then all is spirit and
spirit's manifestation--is it not true?What, then, becomes of the
evil that men hug to their bosoms, even while it gnaws into their
hearts?It is the opposite of good, of mind, of truth, God.And
the opposite of truth is supposition.And you can put it out
whenever you are willing to drop your ceremonials and your theories,
and will open your mentality to truth, which will make you free,
even as the Master said.Those are
the religious views which you have been sent by Madam Elwin to
investigate.She waited a few moments for the doctor to reply.Then, as he remained
silent, she went up to him and held out her hand."You do not care to talk with me longer, I think," she said.But, as regards Madam Elwin's wishes, you may tell
her that I shall leave the school.""Have you--have you been fitting yourself for any--ah--particular
work--ah--for your support, that is?"inquired the doctor gravely, as
he took the proffered hand.He had been swept off his feet by the
girl's conversation, and he had not the temerity to combat her views."I have been working daily to gain a better
understanding of the teachings of Jesus, and through them, of God.My
single aim has been to acquire 'that mind which was in Christ Jesus.'And I have no other business than to reflect it to my fellow-men in a
life of service.That is my Father's business, and I am working with
Him.My mission in this world is to manifest God.I am going out now
to do that, and _to show what love will do_.God will use me, and He
will supply my every need.She turned abruptly from him and went to the organ.Soon the same song
which he had heard as he entered the room rose again through the
stillness.He started toward
the girl; checked himself; and stood hesitating.Then his lips set,
and he turned and walked slowly from the room.In the hall two women were approaching, and as they drew near he
recognized one of them."Why," he exclaimed with enthusiasm, holding out both hands, "my dear
Mrs.It is not so long since we met at the Weston's.But what, may I ask, brings you here?"We have come to,
make a duty call on Mr.Reed's protegee, the little South American
savage, you know.Madam Elwin said she was up here with you?""Ah, yes, quite so--er, in the chapel, I believe," said the clergyman,
his face becoming suddenly grave."I would return with you, but my
time is--ah--so limited."He bowed low, with his hand in the breast of
his long frock coat, and passed on down the hall.As the women approached the door of the chapel through which came
Carmen's low singing they turned and looked at each other inquiringly.Then they quietly entered the doorway and stood listening.Carmen,
concealed behind the organ, did not see them.Hawley-Crowles went quickly to the organ.Bending over it, she gazed down into the face of the startled girl."Get up and let me see what sort of a
looking creature you are."Reed came forward and gave her a tempered
greeting.Hawley-Crowles fell back and stared at the girl
from head to foot."You know," she said to her sister, "this is the
first glimpse I've had of your husband's discovery.I was out of the
city when he brought her to my house, you remember.But," turning
again to Carmen, "sing that song over, dear, please--the one you were
singing just now."Carmen seated herself again at the organ, and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles drew
her sister to the rear of the room."It will sound better back here,"
she explained.After the lapse of a few minutes she turned to Mrs."Belle," she
said, nodding her head sententiously, "you had a pearl, and you threw
it away.Her voice, and her
face--why, with our ward--this beautiful, gifted, South American owner
of a famous mine--as a lever, we can force the Beaubien to bring the
Ames to our terms!Meantime, the dainty Madam Elwin and the amiable Doctor Jurges in the
office below had reached a conclusion."A young lady of--ah--invincible
will," the doctor had observed; "and already--ah--decidedly mature,
despite her tender years.Should she--ah--assume leadership over the
pupils of your school, my dear Madam Elwin, the result might be
disquieting.There can be no question as to her religious views, as I
have said.But, what astonishes me is--ah--that this strange cult
should have its devotees even in the wilds of tropical America!The girl is utterly--ah--unevangelical,
Madam; and the advisability of removing her from the school can not be
questioned."By all means," asserted the latter gentleman with great seriousness,
while his eyes dwelt tenderly upon Madam Elwin's written order for a
hundred shares of Simiti stock which he held in his hand."Very well, then," said the lady with a determined nod of her head; "I
shall request Mrs.Then, with a proper sense
of what it meant to have the moral support of such an eminent divine
as Doctor Jurges, she rang for her maid and bade her summon Mrs.Thus it was that Carmen was again shifted a space on the checkerboard
of life, and slept that night once more under the spacious roof of the
wealthy relict of the late James Hawley-Crowles, on Riverside Drive.CHAPTER 7


As has been said, Carmen's six months in the Elwin school had been a
period of slow adjustment to the changed order.She had brought into
this new world a charm of unsophistication, an ingenuous _naivete_,
such as only an untrammeled spirit nourished in an elemental
civilization like that of primitive Simiti could develop.Added to
this was the zest and eagerness stimulated by the thought that she had
come as a message-bearer to a people with a great need.Her first
emotion had been that of astonishment that the dwellers in the great
States were not so different, after all, from those of her own
unprogressive country.Her next was one of sad disillusionment, as the
fact slowly dawned upon her trusting thought that the busy denizens of
her new environment took no interest whatsoever in her message.And
then her joy and brilliant hopefulness had chilled, and she awoke to
find her strange views a barrier between herself and her associates.She had brought to the America of the North a spirit so deeply
religious as to know naught else than her God and His ceaseless
manifestation.She had come utterly free of dogma or creed, and
happily ignorant of decaying formularies and religious caste.Her
Christianity was her demonstrable interpretation of the Master's
words; and her fresh, ebulliant spirit soared unhampered in the warm
atmosphere of love for mankind.Her concept of the Christ stirred no
thought within her of intolerance toward those who might hold
differing views; nor did it raise interposing barriers within her own
mind, nor evoke those baser sentiments which have so sadly warped the
souls of men into instruments of deadly hatred and crushing tyranny.Her spiritual vision, undimmed and world-embracing, saw the advent of
that day when all mankind would obey the commands of Jesus, and do the
works which he did, even to the complete spiritualization and
dematerializing of all human thought.And her burning desire was to
hasten the coming of that glad hour.The conviction that, despite its tremendous needs, humanity was
steadily rejecting, even in this great land of opportunity and
progress, the remedy for its consuming ills, came to her slowly.And
with it a damping of her ardor, and a dulling of the fine edge of her
enthusiasm.She grew quiet as the days passed, and drew away from her
companions into her thought.With her increasing sense of isolation
came at length a great longing to leave these inhospitable shores, and
return to her native environment and the sympathy and tender
solicitude of her beloved Rosendo and Padre Jose.Indeed, she could not be certain now of their
whereabouts.A great war was raging in Colombia, and she knew not what
fate had befallen her loved ones.To her many letters directed to
Simiti there had come back no reply.Even Harris, who had written
again and again to both Rosendo and Jose, had received no word from
them in return.Corroding fear began to assail the girl; soul-longing
and heart-sickness seized upon her; her happy smile faded; and her
bright, bubbling conversation ceased.Then one day, standing alone in her room, she turned squarely upon the
foul brood of evil suggestions crowding upon her and, as if they were
fell spirits from the nether world, bade them begone."I know you for what you are--_nothing_!You seemed to
use Padre Jose, but you can't use me!He is my life; and you, evil thoughts, can't make me think He isn't!I
am His image and likeness; I am His witness; and I will _not_ witness
to His opposite, evil!My life is filled with harmony; and you, evil
thoughts, can't reverse that fact!God has brought me here, else I
would not have come, for He is the cause of all that is.It is for me
to stand and see His glory.as she paced about the room and
seemed to ward off the assaults of an invisible enemy, "there is no
power apart from Him!Then, in the lull of battle, "Father divine, I thank Thee that Thou
hast heard me.And now I lay my all upon the altar of love, and throw
myself upon Thy thought."From that day, despite continued attacks from error--despite, too, the
veiled slights and covert insinuations of her schoolmates, to whom the
girl's odd views and utter refusal to share their accustomed
conversation, their interest in mundane affairs, their social
aspirations and worldly ambitions, at length made her quite
unwelcome--Carmen steadily, and without heed of diverting gesture,
brought into captivity every thought to the obedience of her
Christ-principle, and threw off for all time the dark cloud of
pessimism which human belief and the mesmerism of events had drawn
over her joyous spirit.Reed had not been near her since her enrollment in the school;
but Ketchim had visited her often--not, however, alone, but always
with one or more prospective purchasers of Simiti stock in tow whom
he sought to influence favorably through Carmen's interesting
conversation about her native land.Harris came every Sunday, and
the girl welcomed the great, blundering fellow as the coming of the
day.At times he would obtain Madam Elwin's permission to take the
girl up to the city on a little sight-seeing expedition, and then he
would abandon himself completely to the enjoyment of her naive wonder
and the numberless and often piquant questions stimulated by it.He
was the only one now with whom she felt any degree of freedom, and
in his presence her restraint vanished and her airy gaiety again
welled forth with all its wonted fervor.Once, shortly after Carmen
had been enrolled, Harris took her to a concert by the New York
Symphony Orchestra.But in the midst of the program, after sitting
in silent rapture, the girl suddenly burst into tears and begged to be
taken out.she sobbed as, outside the door,
she hid her tear-stained face in his coat; "I just couldn't!Oh, it was God that we heard--it was God!"And the
astonished fellow respected this sudden outburst of pent-up emotion
as he led her, silent and absorbed, back to the school.With the throwing of the girl upon her own thought came a rapid
expansion of both mind and body into maturity, and the young lady who
left the Elwin school that bright spring afternoon under the
protection of the self-sufficient Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was very far
from being the inquisitive, unabashed little girl who had so
greatly shocked the good Sister Superior by her heretical views
some six months before.The sophistication engendered by her
intercourse with the pupils and instructors in the school had
transformed the eager, trusting little maid, who could see only good
into a mature woman, who, though her trust remained unshaken,
nevertheless had a better understanding of the seeming power "that
lusteth against the spirit," and whose idea of her mission had been
deepened into a grave sense of responsibility.She saw now, as never
before, the awful unreality of the human sense of life; but she
likewise understood, as never previously, its seeming reality in
the human consciousness, and its terrible mesmeric power over
those materialistic minds into which the light of spirituality had as
yet scarcely penetrated.Her thought had begun to shape a definite
purpose; she was still to be a message-bearer, but the message must be
set forth in her life conduct.The futility of promiscuous verbal
delivery of the message to whomsoever might cross her path had
been made patent.She must do
likewise, and let her deeds attest the truth of her words.And from
the day that she bade the suggestions of fear and evil leave her,
she had consecrated herself anew to a searching study of the
Master's life and words, if happily she might acquire "that mind"
which he so wondrously expressed.But the assumption of an attitude of quiet demonstration was by no
means sudden.There were times when she could not restrain the impulse
to challenge the beliefs so authoritatively set forth by the preachers
and lecturers whom Madam Elwin invited to address her pupils, and who,
unlike Jesus, first taught, and then relegated their proofs to a life
beyond the grave.Once, shortly after entering the school, forgetful
of all but the error being preached, she had risen in the midst of an
eloquent sermon by the eminent Darius Borwell, a Presbyterian divine
of considerable repute, and asked him why it was that, as he seemed to
set forth, God had changed His mind after creating spiritual man, and
had created a man of dust.She had later repented her scandalous
conduct in sackcloth and ashes; but it did not prevent her from
abruptly leaving the chapel on a subsequent Sunday when another
divine, this time a complaisant Methodist, quite satisfied with his
theories of endless future rewards and fiery punishments, dwelt at
length upon the traditional idea that the sorrows of the world are
God-sent for mankind's chastisement and discipline.Then she gradually learned to be less defiant of the conventions and
beliefs of the day, and determined quietly to rise superior to them.But her experience with the preachers wrought within her a strong
determination henceforth to listen to no religious propaganda
whatsoever, to give no further heed to current theological beliefs,
and to enter no church edifice, regardless of the tenets of the sect
worshiping within its precincts.The wisdom of this decision she left
for the future to determine."Oh," she cried, "my only mission is to manifest the divine, not to
waste time listening to the theories of ignorant preachers, who fail
utterly to prove the truth of their teachings!Oh, how the world needs
love--just love!And I am going to love it with the selfless love that
comes from God, and destroys error and the false beliefs that become
externalized in the human consciousness as sickness, failure, old
age, and death!Love, love, love--it is mankind's greatest need!Why,
if the preachers only knew, the very heart and soul of Christianity is
love!It is love that casts out fear; and fear is at the bottom of all
sickness, for fear leads to belief in other gods than the one Father
of Christ Jesus!Oh, God--take me
out into the world, and let me show it what love can do!"And the divine ear heard the call of this beautiful disciple of the
Christ--aye, had heard it long before the solicitous, fluttering
little Madam Elwin decided that the strange girl's unevangelical views
were inimical to the best interests of her very select school.Hawley-Crowles threw wide the
portals of the world to Carmen, and she entered, wide-eyed and
wondering.Nor did she return until the deepest recesses of the human
mind had revealed to her their abysmal hideousness, their ghastly
emptiness of reality, and their woeful mesmeric deception.James Hawley-Crowles, more keenly perceptive than her sister, had
seized upon Carmen with avidity bred of hope long deferred.The
scourge of years of fruitless social striving had rendered her
desperate, and she would have staged a ballet on her dining table,
with her own ample self as _premiere danseuse_, did the attraction but
promise recognition from the blase members of fashionable New York's
ultra-conservative set.From childhood she had looked eagerly forward
through the years with an eye single to such recognition as life's
desideratum.To this end she had bartered both youth and beauty with
calculated precision for the Hawley-Crowles money bags; only to weep
floods of angry tears when the bargain left her social status
unchanged, and herself tied to a decrepit old rounder, whose tarnished
name wholly neutralized the purchasing power of his ill-gotten gold.Fortunately for the reputations of them both, her husband had the good
sense to depart this life ere the divorce proceedings which she had
long had in contemplation were instituted; whereupon the stricken
widow had him carefully incinerated and his ashes tenderly deposited
in a chaste urn in a mausoleum which her architect had taken oath cost
more than the showy Ames vault by many thousands.The period of
decorous mourning past, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles blithely doffed her weeds
and threw herself again into the terrific competition for social
standing, determined this time that it should be a warfare to the
death.And so it bade fair to prove to her, when the eminent nerve
specialist, Dr.Bascom Ross, giving a scant half hour to the
consideration of her case, at the modest charge of one hundred
dollars, warned her to declare a truce and flee to the Alps for
unalloyed rest.She complied, and had returned with restored health
and determination just as her sister came up from South America,
bringing the odd little "savage" whom Reed had discovered in the wilds
of Guamoco.A prolonged week-end at Newport, the last of the summer
season, accounted for her absence from the city when Reed brought
Carmen to her house, where he and his wife were making their temporary
abode.Six months later, in her swift appraisal of the girl in the
Elwin school, to whom she had never before given a thought, she seemed
to see a light."It does look like a desperate chance, I admit," she said, when
recounting her plans to her sister a day or so later."But I've played
every other card in my hand; and now this girl is going to be either a
trump or a joker.All we need is a word from the Beaubien, and the
following week will see an invitation at our door from Mrs.The trick is to reach the Beaubien.And I'm going to introduce the girl as an Inca
princess.Reed was not less ambitious than her sister, but hitherto she had
lacked the one essential to social success, money.In addition, she
had committed the egregious blunder of marrying for love.And now that
the honeymoon had become a memory, and she faced again her growing
ambition, with a struggling husband who had neither name nor wealth to
aid her, she had found her own modest income of ten thousand a year,
which she had inherited from her mother, only an aggravation.True, in
time her wandering father would pass away; and there was no doubt that
his vast property would fall to his daughters, his only living kin.But at present, in view of his aggressively good health and disregard
for his relatives, her only recourse was to attach herself to her
wealthy, sharp-witted sister, and hope to be towed safely into the
social swim, should that scheming lady ultimately achieve her high
ambition.Hawley-Crowles should have seen in Carmen a means of
reaching a woman of the stamp of the Beaubien, and through her the
leader of the most exclusive social set in the metropolis, is
difficult to say.But thus does the human mind often seek to further
its own dubious aims through guileless innocence and trust.Hawley-Crowles had likewise a slight trace of that clairvoyance
of wisdom which so characterized the girl.But with this difference,
that she knew not why she was led to adopt certain means; while
Carmen, penetrating externals, consciously sought to turn those who
would employ her into channels for the expression of her own dominant
thought.Be that as it may, the Beaubien was now the stone before the
door of their hope, and Carmen the lever by which these calculating
women intended it should be moved."The Beaubien, my dear," explained Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to her
inquisitive sister, whose life had been lived almost entirely away
from New York, "is J. Wilton Ames's very particular friend, of long
standing.As I told you, I have recently been going through my late
unpleasant husband's effects, and have unearthed letters and memoranda
which throw floods of light upon Jim's early indiscretions and his
association with both the Beaubien and Ames.Jim once told me, in a
burst of alcoholic confidence, that she had saved him from J. Wilton's
clutches in the dim past, and for that he owed her endless gratitude,
as well as for never permitting him to darken her door again.Now I
have never met the Beaubien.But I dare say she knows
all about us.However, the point that concerns us now is this: she has
a hold on Ames, and, unless rumor is wide of the truth, when she hints
to him that his wife's dinner list or yachting party seems incomplete
without such or such a name, why, the list is immediately revised."The position which the Beaubien held was, if Madam On-dit was not to
be wholly discredited, to say the least, unique.It was not as social
dictator that she posed, for in a great cosmopolitan city where polite
society is infinitely complex in its make-up such a position can
scarcely be said to exist.It was rather as an influence that she was
felt, an influence never seen, but powerful, subtle, and wholly
inexplicable, working now through this channel, now through that, and
effecting changes in the social complexion of conservative New York
that were utterly in defiance of the most rigid convention.Particularly was her power felt in the narrow circle over which Mrs.J. Wilton Ames presided, by reason of her own and her husband's
aristocratic descent, and the latter's bursting coffers and supremacy
in the realm of finance.Only for her sagacity, the great influence of the woman would have
been short-lived.But, whatever else might be said of her, the
Beaubien was wise, with a discretion that was positively uncanny.Tall, voluptuous, yet graceful as a fawn; black, wavy, abundant hair;
eyes whose dark, liquid depths held unfathomable mysteries; gracious,
affable, yet keen as a razor blade; tender, even sentimental on
occasions, with an infinite capacity for either love or hate, this
many-sided woman, whose brilliant flashes of wit kept the savant or
roue at her table in an uproar, could, if occasion required, found an
orphanage or drop a bichloride tablet in the glass of her rival with
the same measure of calculating precision and disdain of the future.It was said of her that she might have laid down her life for the man
she loved.It is probable that she never met with one worth the
sacrifice.While yet in short dresses she had fled from her boarding school, near
a fashionable resort in the New Hampshire hills, with a French
Colonel, Gaspard de Beaubien, a man twice her age.With him she had
spent eight increasingly miserable years in Paris.Then, her withered
romance carefully entombed in the secret places of her heart, she
secured a divorce from the roistering colonel, together with a small
settlement, and set sail for New York to hunt for larger and more
valuable game.With abundant charms and sang-froid for her capital, she rented an
expensive apartment in a fashionable quarter of the city, and then
settled down to business.Whether she would have fallen upon bad days
or not will never be known, for the first haul of her widespread net
landed a fish of supreme quality, J. Wilton Ames.On the plea of
financial necessity, she had gone boldly to his office with the deed
to a parcel of worthless land out on the moist sands of the New Jersey
shore, which the unscrupulous Gaspard de Beaubien had settled upon her
when she severed the tie which bound them, and which, after weeks of
careful research, she discovered adjoined a tract owned by Ames.Pushing aside office boy, clerk, and guard, she reached the inner
_sanctum_ of the astonished financier himself and offered to sell at a
ruinous figure.A few well-timed tears, an expression of angelic
innocence on her beautiful face, a despairing gesture or two with her
lovely arms, coupled with the audacity which she had shown in forcing
an entrance into his office, effected the man's capitulation.She was
then in her twenty-fourth year.The result was that she cast her net no more, but devoted herself
thenceforth with tender consecration to her important catch.In time
Ames brought a friend, the rollicking James Hawley-Crowles, to call
upon the charming Beaubien.In time, too, as was perfectly natural, a
rivalry sprang up between the men, which the beautiful creature
watered so tenderly that the investments which she was enabled to make
under the direction of these powerful rivals flourished like Jack's
beanstalk, and she was soon able to leave her small apartment and take
a suite but a few blocks from the Ames mansion.At length the strain between Ames and Hawley-Crowles reached the
breaking point; and then the former decided that the woman's
bewitching smiles should thenceforth be his alone.He forthwith drew
the seldom sober Hawley-Crowles into certain business deals, with the
gentle connivance of the suave Beaubien herself, and at length sold
the man out short and presented a claim on every dollar he possessed.Hawley-Crowles awoke from his blissful dream sober and trimmed.But
then the Beaubien experienced one of her rare and inexplicable
revulsions of the ethical sense, and a compromise had to be effected,
whereby the Hawley-Crowles fortune was saved, though the man should
see the Beaubien no more.By this time her beauty was blooming in its utmost profusion, and her
prowess had been fairly tried.She took a large house, furnished it
like unto a palace, and proceeded to throw her gauntlet in the face of
the impregnable social caste.There she drew about her a circle of
bon-vivants, artists, litterateurs, politicians, and men of
finance--with never a woman in the group.Yet in her new home she
established a social code as rigid as the Median law, and woe to him
within her gates who thereafter, with or without intent, passed the
bounds of respectful decorum.His name was heard no more on her rosy
lips.Her dinners were Lucullan in their magnificence; and over the rare
wines and imperial cigars which she furnished, her guests passed many
a tip and prognostication anent the market, which she in turn quietly
transmitted to her brokers.She came to understand the game
thoroughly, and, while it was her heyday of glorious splendor, she
played hard.She had bartered every priceless gift of nature for
gold--and she made sure that the measure she received in return was
full.Her gaze was ever upon the approaching day when those charms
would be but bitter memories; and it was her grim intention that when
it came silken ease should compensate for their loss.Ten years passed, and the Beaubien's reign continued with undimmed
splendor.In the meantime, the wife of J. Wilton Ames had reached the
zenith of her ambitions and was the acknowledged leader in New York's
most fashionable social circle.But, though
the Beaubien had never sought the entree to formal society, preferring
to hold her own court, at which no women attended, she exercised a
certain control over it through her influence upon the man Ames.Ames knew of the long-continued relations between her husband and
this woman was never divulged.And doubtless she was wholly satisfied
that his wealth and power afforded her the position which her heart
had craved; and, that secure, she was willing to leave him to his own
methods of obtaining diversion.But rumor was persistent, maliciously
so; and rumor declared that the list of this envied society dame was
not drawn up without the approval of her husband and the woman with
whom his leisure hours were invariably spent.Hawley-Crowles, whose doting mate had once fawned in the perfumed wake
of the luxurious Beaubien.Carmen, whose wishes had not been consulted, had voiced no objection
whatever to returning to the Hawley-Crowles home.Indeed, she secretly
rejoiced that an opportunity had been so easily afforded for escape
from the stifling atmosphere of the Elwin school, and for entrance
into the great world of people and affairs, where she believed the
soil prepared for the seed she would plant.That dire surprises
awaited her, of which she could not even dream, did not enter her
calculations.Secure in her quenchless faith, she gladly accepted the
proffered shelter of the Hawley-Crowles mansion, and the protection of
its worldly, scheming inmates.In silent, wide-eyed wonder, in the days that followed, the girl
strove to accustom herself to the luxury of her surroundings, and to
the undreamed of marvels which made for physical comfort and
well-being.Hawley-Crowles settled upon her seemed a fortune--enough, she thought,
to buy the whole town of Simiti!Her gowns seemed woven on fairy
looms, and often she would sit for hours, holding them in her lap and
reveling in their richness.Then, when at length she could bring
herself to don the robes and peep timidly into the great pier glasses,
she would burst into startled exclamations and hide her face in her
hands, lest the gorgeous splendor of the beautiful reflection
overpower her."Oh," she would exclaim, "it can't be that the girl reflected there
ever lived and dressed as I did in Simiti!I wonder, oh, I wonder if
Padre Jose knew that these things were in the world!"And then, as she leaned back in her chair and gave herself into the
hands of the admiring French maid, she would close her eyes and dream
that the fairy-stories which the patient Jose had told her again and
again in her distant home town had come true, and that she had been
transformed into a beautiful princess, who would some day go in search
of the sleeping priest and wake him from his mesmeric dream.Then would come the inevitable thought of the little newsboy of
Cartagena, to whom she had long since begun to send monetary
contributions--and of her unanswered letters--of the war devastating
her native land--of rudely severed ties, and unimaginable changes--and
she would start from her musing and brush away the gathering tears,
and try to realize that her present situation and environment were but
means to an end, opportunities which her God had given her to do His
work, with no thought of herself.A few days after Carmen had been installed in her new home, during
which she had left the house only for her diurnal ride in the big
limousine, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles announced her readiness to fire the
first gun in the attack upon the Beaubien."My dear," she said to her
sister, as they sat alone in the luxurious sun-parlor, "my washerwoman
dropped a remark the other day which gave me something to build on.Her two babies are in the General Orphan Asylum, up on Twenty-third
street.Well, it happens that this institution is the Beaubien's sole
charity--in fact, it is her particular hobby.I presume that she feels
she is now a middle-aged woman, and that the time is not far distant
when she will have to close up her earthly accounts and hand them over
to the heavenly auditor.Anyway, this last year or two she has
suddenly become philanthropic, and when the General Orphan Asylum was
building she gave some fifty thousand dollars for a cottage in her
name.What's more, the trustees of the Asylum accepted it without the
wink of an eyelash."But here's the point: some rich old fellow has willed the institution
a fund whose income every year is used to buy clothing for the
kiddies; and they have a sort of celebration on the day the duds are
given out, and the public is invited to inspect the place and the
inmates, and eat a bit, and look around generally.Well, my
washerwoman tells me that the Beaubien always attends these annual
celebrations.The next one, I learn, comes in about a month.I propose
that we attend; take Carmen; ask permission for her to sing to the
children, and thereby attract the attention of the gorgeous Beaubien,
who will be sure to speak to the girl, who is herself an orphan, and,
ten to one, want to see more of her.I'll have a
word to say regarding our immense debt of gratitude to her for saving
Jim's fortune years ago when he was entangled in her net--and, well,
if that scheme doesn't work, I have other strings to my bow."But it did work, and with an ease that exceeded the most sanguine
hopes of its projector.On the day that the General Orphan Asylum
threw wide its doors to the public, the Hawley-Crowles limousine
rubbed noses with the big French car of the Beaubien in the street
without; while within the building the Beaubien held the hand of the
beautiful girl whose voluntary singing had spread a veil of silence
over the awed spectators in the great assembly room, and, looking
earnestly down into the big, trusting, brown eyes, said: "My dear
child, I want to know you."Then, turning to the eager, itching Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I shall send my car for her to-morrow afternoon, with
your permission."Hawley-Crowles wildly hugged her
sister and the girl all the way home--then went to bed that night with
tears of apprehension in her washed-out eyes, lest she had shown
herself too eager in granting the Beaubien's request.But her fears
were turned to exultation when the Beaubien car drew up at her door
the following day at three, and the courteous French chauffeur
announced his errand.A few moments later, while the car glided
purring over the smooth asphalt, Carmen, robed like a princess, lay
back in the cushions and dreamed of the poor priest in the dead little
town so far away.CHAPTER 9


"Sing it again, dear.I know you are tired, but I want to hear that
song just once more.Somehow it seems to bring up thoughts of--of
things that might have been."The Beaubien's voice sank to a whisper
as she finished.Carmen laughed happily and prepared to repeat the weird lament which
had so fascinated the Reverend Doctor Jurges a few days before."I--I don't know why that song affects me so," mused the Beaubien,
when the girl had finished and returned to the seat beside her.Then,
abruptly: "I wish you could play the pipe-organ out in the hall.I put
twelve thousand dollars into it, and I can't even play five-finger
exercises on it."exclaimed Carmen, drawing a long breath,
while her eyes dilated."Well, you poor, unsophisticated girl, suppose we just go down there
and buy the whole town.It would at least give me an interest in life.Do you think I could stand the heat there?How did you live, and what did you do?And are
you really descended from the old Incas?"They were alone in the darkened music room, and the soft-stepping,
liveried butler had just set the tea table before them, At one end of
the long room a cheery fire snapped and crackled in the huge
fireplace, tempering the sharpness of the early spring day and casting
a ruddy glow upon the tapestried walls and polished floor in front,
where dozed the Beaubien's two "babies," Japanese and Pekingese
spaniels of registered pedigree and fabulous value.Among the heavy
beams of the lofty ceiling grotesque shadows danced and flickered,
while over the costly rugs and rare skins on the floor below subdued
lights played in animated pantomime.Behind the magnificent grand
piano a beautifully wrought harp reflected a golden radiance into the
room.Everything in the woman's environment was softened into the same
degree of voluptuousness which characterized her and the life of
sybaritic ease which she affected.From the moment Carmen entered the house she had been charmed,
fascinated, overpowered by the display of exhaustless wealth and
the rich taste exhibited in its harmonious manifestation.The
Hawley-Crowles home had seemed to her the epitome of material
elegance and comfort, far exceeding the most fantastic concepts of her
childish imagination, when she had listened enraptured to Padre
Jose's compelling stories of the great world beyond Simiti.But the
gorgeous web of this social spider made even the Hawley-Crowles
mansion suffer in comparison."And yet," said the amused Beaubien, when Carmen could no longer
restrain her wonder and admiration, "this is but a shed beside the new
Ames house, going up on Fifth Avenue.I presume he will put not less
than ten millions into it before it is finished."Carmen dared not attempt to grasp the
complex significance of such an expenditure."Why, is that such a huge amount, child?"asked the Beaubien, as
accustomed to think in eight figures as in two."But, I forget that
you are from the jungle.she mused, gazing
with undisguised admiration at the beautiful, animated girl before
her.Carmen was struggling with the
deluge of new impressions; and the woman fastened her eyes upon her as
if she would have them bore deep into the soul of whose rarity she was
becoming slowly aware.What thoughts coursed through the mind of the
Beaubien as she sat studying the girl through the tempered light, we
may not know.What she saw in Carmen that attracted her, she herself
might not have told.Had she, too, this ultra-mondaine, this creature
of gold and tinsel, felt the spell of the girl's great innocence and
purity of thought, her righteousness?Or did she see in her something
that she herself might once have been--something that all her gold,
and all the wealth of Ormus or of Ind could never buy?"What have you got," she suddenly, almost rudely, exclaimed, "that I
haven't?"And then the banality of the question struck her, and she
laughed harshly."Why," said Carmen, looking up quickly and beaming upon the woman,
"you have everything!"You," returned the woman quickly, though she knew not why she said
it.And yet, memory was busy uncovering those bitter days when, in the
first agony of marital disappointment, she had, with hot, streaming
tears, implored heaven to give her a child.But the gift had been
denied; and her heart had shrunk and grown heavily calloused.Then she spoke more gently, and there was that in her voice which
stirred the girl's quick sympathy."Yes, you have youth, and beauty.But I could part with them, gladly, if only
there were anything left."Carmen instantly rose and went swiftly to her.Forgetful of caste,
decorum, convention, everything but the boundless love which she felt
for all mankind, she put her arms about the worldly woman's neck and
kissed her.For a moment the Beaubien sat in speechless surprise.It was the only
manifestation of selfless love that had ever come into her sordid
experience.that it was an
act of real sympathy, and not a clever ruse to win her from behind the
mask of affection?Her own kisses, she knew, were bestowed only for
favors.they drew not many now, although time was when a single
one might win a brooch or a string of pearls.The girl herself quickly met the woman's groping thought."I'm in the
world to show what love will do," she murmured; "and I love you."Had
she not thus solved every problem from earliest childhood?Not even a heart of stone could withstand the
solvent power of such love.Her head dropped upon her breast, and she
wept."Don't cry," said Carmen, tenderly caressing the bepowdered cheek."Why, we are all God's children; we all have one another; you have me,
and I have you; and God means us all to be happy."The Beaubien looked up, wondering.Her variegated life included no
such tender experience as this.She had long since ceased to shed
aught but tears of anger.But now--

She clutched the girl to her and kissed her eagerly; then gently
motioned her back to her chair."Don't mind it," she smiled, with
swimming eyes, and a shade of embarrassment."I don't know of anything
that would help me as much as a good cry.If I could have had a
daughter like you, I should--but never mind now."She tried to laugh,
as she wiped her eyes.Then an idea seemed to flash through her jaded brain, and she became
suddenly animated."Why--listen," she said; "don't you want to learn
the pipe-organ?I will pay for
them; I will engage the best teacher in New York; and you shall take
two or three a week, and use the big organ out in the hall.Carmen's heart gave a great leap."I'll do it myself," returned the woman with growing enthusiasm."William," she directed, when the butler responded to her summons,
"get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles on the wire at once.But who is coming, I
wonder?"glancing through the window at an automobile that had drawn
up at her door.a look of vexation mantling her face, "the
Right Reverend Monsignor Lafelle.Well," turning to Carmen, "I suppose
I'll have to send you home now, dear.Hawley-Crowles
that I shall call for you to-morrow afternoon, and that I shall speak
to her at that time about your music lessons.William, take Monsignor
into the morning room, and then tell Henri to bring the car to the
porte-cochere for Miss Carmen.Good-bye, dear," kissing the bright,
upturned face of the waiting girl."I wish I could--but, well, don't
forget that I'm coming for you to-morrow."Hawley-Crowles directed her French tailor to cable
to Paris for advance styles.Twenty-four hours later she hastened with
outstretched arms to greet the Beaubien, waiting in the reception
room.Oh, yes, they had heard often of each other; and now were so
pleased to meet!New York was such a whirlpool, and it was so
difficult to form desirable friendships.Yes, the Beaubien had known
the late-lamented Hawley-Crowles; but, dear!that was years and
years ago, before he had married, and when they were both young and
foolish.Hawley-Crowles, chance enabled him and me to be mutually
helpful at a time when I was in sore need of a friend; and the debt of
gratitude is not yours to me, but mine to your kind husband."Hawley-Crowles could have hugged her on the spot.What cared she
that her husband's always unsavory name had been linked with this
woman's?She had married the roistering blade for his bank account
only.Any other male whose wealth ran into seven figures would have
done as well, or better.Hawley-Crowles gratefully
accepted the use of the organ and the Beaubien mansion for the girl;
but she herself insisted upon bearing the expense of the lessons.Together, she and the Beaubien,
they would foster and develop it.Moreover, though of course this must
follow later, she intended to give the girl every social advantage
befitting her beauty, her talents, and her station.And then, when the Beaubien, who knew to a second just how long to
stay, had departed, taking Carmen with her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles turned
to her sister with her face flushed with anger.she exclaimed, while hot tears suffused her eyes."The hussy went away
actually laughing at me!What do you suppose she's got up her sleeve?But, let me tell you, she'll not fool me!I'll slap that arrogant Ames
woman yet; and then, when I've done that, I'll give the Beaubien
something to think about besides the way she did up poor old Jim!"*       *       *       *       *

There was now but one cloud that cast its dark shadow across the full
splendor of Carmen's happiness, the silence that shrouded Simiti.But
Harris was preparing to return to Colombia, and his trip promised a
solution of the mystery of her unanswered letters.For weeks Carmen
had struggled to teach him Spanish, with but small measure of success."You'll have to go back with me and
act as interpreter," he said one day, when they were alone in the
Hawley-Crowles parlor.Then a curious light came into his eyes, and he
blurted, "Will you?"But the girl turned the question aside with a laugh, though she knew
not from what depths it had sprung.Harris shrugged his broad
shoulders and sighed.He had not a hundred dollars to his name.Yet he had prospects, not the least of which was the interest he
shared with Reed in La Libertad.For, despite the disturbed state of
affairs in Colombia, Simiti stock had sold rapidly, under the sedulous
care of Ketchim and his loyal aids, and a sufficient fund had been
accumulated to warrant the inauguration of development work on the
mine.A few years hence Harris should be rich from that source alone.Reed was still in California, although the alluring literature which
Ketchim was scattering broadcast bore his name as consulting engineer
to the Simiti Development Company.His wife had continued her
temporary abode in the Hawley-Crowles mansion, while awaiting with
what fortitude she could command the passing of her still vigorous
father, and the results of her defiant sister's assaults upon the Ames
set.The wonderful organ in the Beaubien
mansion had cast a spell of enchantment over her soul, and daily she
sat before it, uncovering new marvels and losing herself deeper and
deeper in its infinite mysteries.Her progress was commensurate with
her consecration, and brought exclamations of astonishment to the lips
of her now devoted Beaubien.Hour after hour the latter would sit in
the twilight of the great hall, with her eyes fastened upon the
absorbed girl, and her leaden soul slowly, painfully struggling to
lift itself above the murk and dross in which it had lain buried for
long, meaningless years.They now talked but little, this strange
woman and the equally strange girl.Their communion was no longer of
the lips.It was the silent yearning of a dry, desolate heart,
striving to open itself to the love which the girl was sending far and
wide in the quenchless hope that it might meet just such a need.For
Carmen dwelt in the spirit, and she instinctively accepted her
splendid material environment as the gift, not of man, but of the
great divine Mind, which had led her into this new world that she
might be a channel for the expression of its love to the erring
children of mortals.She came and went quietly, and yet with as much confidence as if the
house belonged to her.At first the Beaubien smiled indulgently.And
then her smile became a laugh of eager joy as she daily greeted her
radiant visitor, whose entrance into the great, dark house was always
followed by a flood of sunshine, and whose departure marked the
setting in of night to the heart-hungry woman.In the first days of
their association the Beaubien could turn easily from the beautiful
girl to the group of cold, scheming men of the world who filled her
evenings and sat about her board.But as days melted into weeks, she
became dimly conscious of an effort attaching to the transition; and
the hour at length arrived when she fully realized that she was facing
the most momentous decision that had ever been evolved by her worldly
mode of living.But that was a matter of slow development through many
months.Hawley-Crowles trod the clouds.A week after Carmen
began the study of the organ she boldly ventured to accompany her one
day to the Beaubien citadel.She was graciously received, and departed
with the Beaubien's promise to return the call.Thereupon she set
about revising her own social list, and dropped several names which
she now felt could serve her no longer.Her week-end at Newport, just
prior to her visit to the Elwin school, had marked the close of the
gay season in the city, and New York had entered fully upon its summer
_siesta_.Even the theaters and concert halls were closed, and the
metropolis was nodding its weary head dully and sinking into
somnolence.The
summer interim would give her time to further her plans and prepare
the girl for her social _debut_ in the early winter."And Milady Ames
will be mentioned in the papers next day as assisting at the
function--the cat!"she muttered savagely, as she laid aside her
revised list of social desirables.But in preparing Carmen that summer for her subsequent entry into
polite society Mrs.Hawley-Crowles soon realized that she had
assumed a task of generous proportions.In the first place,
despite all efforts, the girl could not be brought to a proper
sense of money values.Her eyes were ever gaping in astonishment at
what Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister regarded as the most moderate
of expenditures, and it was only when the Beaubien herself mildly
hinted to them that ingenuousness was one of the girl's greatest
social assets, that they learned to smile indulgently at her wonder,
even while inwardly pitying her dense ignorance and lack of
sophistication.A second source of trial to her guardians was her delicate sense of
honor; and it was this that one day nearly sufficed to wreck their
standing with the fashionable Mrs.Gannette of Riverside Drive, a
pompous, bepowdered, curled and scented dame, anaemic of mind, but
tremendously aristocratic, and of scarcely inferior social dignity to
that of the envied Mrs.Gannette moved into the
neighborhood where dwelt the ambitious Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the latter
was taken by a mutual acquaintance to call upon her, and was
immediately received into the worldly old lady's good graces.And it
so happened that, after the gay season had closed that summer, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister to an informal
afternoon of bridge, and especially requested that they bring their
young ward, whose beauty and wonderful story were, through the
discreet maneuvers of her guardians, beginning to be talked about.Hawley-Crowles had been inducting Carmen
into the mysteries of the game; but with indifferent success, for the
girl's thoughts invariably were elsewhere engaged.On this particular
afternoon Carmen was lost in contemplation of the gorgeous dress, the
lavish display of jewelry, and the general inanity of conversation;
and her score was pitiably low.The following morning, to her great
astonishment, she received a bill from the practical Mrs.Gannette for
ten dollars to cover her losses at the game.For a long time the
bewildered girl mused over it.Then she called the chauffeur and
despatched him to the Gannette mansion with the money necessary to
meet the gambling debt, and three dollars additional to pay for the
refreshments she had eaten, accompanying it with a polite little note
of explanation.The result was an explosion that nearly lifted the asphalt from the
Drive; and Carmen, covered with tears and confusion, was given to
understand by the irate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles that her conduct was as
reprehensible as if she had attacked the eminent Mrs.Whereupon the sorrowing Carmen packed her effects and prepared to
depart from the presence of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, to the terrified
consternation of the latter, who alternately prostrated herself before
the girl and the offended Mrs.Gannette, and at length, after many
days of perspiring effort and voluminous explanation, succeeded in
restoring peace.When the Beaubien, who had become the girl's confidante, learned the
story, she laughed till her sides ached.And then her lips set, and
her face grew terribly hard, and she muttered, "Fools!"But she smiled
again as she gathered the penitent girl in her arms, and kissed her."You will learn many things, dearie, before you are through with New
York.And," she added, her brow again clouding, "you _will_ be through
with it--some day!"That evening she repeated the story at her table, and Gannette, who
happened to be present, swore between roars of laughter that he would
use it as a club over his wife, should she ever again trap him in any
of his numerous indiscretions.Again, the girl's odd views of life and its meaning which, despite her
efforts, she could not refrain from voicing now and then, caused the
worldly Mrs.Hawley-Crowles much consternation.Carmen tried
desperately to be discreet.Even Harris advised her to listen much,
but say little; and she strove hard to obey.But she would forget and
hurl the newspapers from her with exclamations of horror over their
red-inked depictions of mortal frailty--she would flatly refuse to
discuss crime or disease--and she would comment disparagingly at too
frequent intervals on the littleness of human aims and the emptiness
of the peacock-life which she saw manifested about her."I don't
understand--I can't," she would say, when she was alone with the
Beaubien."Why, with the wonderful opportunities which you rich people
have, how can you--oh, how can you toss them aside for the frivolities
and littleness that you all seem to be striving for!It seems to me
you must be mad--_loco_!And I know you are, for you are simply
mesmerized!"Then the Beaubien would smile knowingly and take her in her arms."We
shall see," she would often say, "we shall see."Thus the summer months sped swiftly past, with Carmen ever looking and
listening, receiving, sifting, in, but not of, the new world into
which she had been cast.In a sense her existence was as narrowly
routined as ever it had been in Simiti, for her days were spent at the
great organ, with frequent rides in the automobile through the parks
and boulevards for variation; and her evenings were jealously guarded
by Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose policy was to keep the girl in seclusion
until the advent of her formal introduction to the world of
fashionable society, when her associates would be selected only from
the narrow circle of moneyed or titled people with whom alone she
might mingle.To permit her to form promiscuous acquaintances now
might prove fatal to the scheming woman's cherished plans, and was a
risk that could not be entertained.And Carmen, suppressing her
wonder, and striving incessantly to curb her ready tongue, accepted
her environment as the unreal expression of the human mind, and
submitted--and waited.CHAPTER 10

The chill blasts had begun to swoop down from the frozen North, and
summer had gathered her dainty robes about her and fled shivering
before them.Hawley-Crowles stood at a window and gazed with
unseeing eyes at the withered leaves tossing in the wind.Carmen's sixteenth birthday was past by some months; the gay season
was at hand; and the day was speeding toward her which she had set for
the girl's formal _debut_.Already, through informal calls and
gatherings, she had made her charming and submissive ward known to
most of her own city acquaintances and the members of her particular
set.The fresh, beautiful girl's winning personality; her frank,
ingenuous manner; her evident sincerity and her naive remarks, which
now only gave hints of her radical views, had opened every heart wide
to her, and before the advent of the social season her wonderful story
was on everybody's tongue.There remained now only the part which the
woman had planned for the Beaubien, but which, thus far, she had found
neither the courage nor the opportunity to suggest to that influential
woman.Gazing out into the deserted street, she stamped her ample foot
in sheer vexation.The Beaubien had absorbed Carmen; had been
politely affable to her and her sister; had called twice during the
summer; and had said nothing.The
hint must come from the other side; and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles could have
wept with chagrin as she reflected gloomily on her own timorous
spirit.But as she stood in dejection before the window a vague idea flitted
into her brain, and she clutched at it desperately.Carmen had spoken
of the frequent calls of a certain Monsignor Lafelle at the Beaubien
mansion, although the girl had never met him."Old Gaspard de Beaubien was a
French Catholic."Nothing--except--why, to be sure,
the girl came from a Catholic country, and therefore was a Catholic!That was worth developing a little
further."Let us see," she reflected, "Kathleen Ames is coming out
this winter, too.Candidate for her mother's
social position, of course.The Reverend Darius Borwell, D.D., L.L.D., and any other D. that will
keep him glued to his ten-thousand-dollar salary, hooked them early in
the game.Now suppose--suppose Lafelle should tell the Beaubien
that--that there's--no, that won't do!But suppose I tell him that
here's a chance for him to back a Catholic against a Protestant for
the highest social honors in New York--Carmen versus Kathleen--what
would he say?I'm just as good a Catholic as Protestant.And Catholic, Methodist, or Hard-shell
Baptist, as suited his needs.Suppose I should tip
it off to Lafelle that I'm smitten with the pious intention of
donating an altar to Holy Saints Cathedral in memory of my late,
unlamented consort--what then?Yes,
it's not a bad idea at all."And thus it was that a few days later Mrs.Hawley-Crowles timed it so
carefully that she chanced to call on the Beaubien with Carmen shortly
after Monsignor Lafelle's car had pulled up at the same door.It was
the merest accident, too, that Carmen led her puffing guardian
directly into the morning room, where sat the Beaubien and Monsignor
in earnest conversation.Hawley-Crowles would have retired at
once, stammering apologies, and reprimanding Carmen for her assumption
of liberties in another's house; but the Beaubien was grace and
cordiality itself, and she insisted on retaining her three callers and
making them mutually acquainted.Hawley-Crowles found it easy to take
the contemplated plunge.Therefore she smiled triumphantly when, a
week later, Monsignor Lafelle alighted at her own door, in response to
a summons on matters pertaining to the Church."But, Madam," replied the holy man, after carefully listening to her
announcement, "I can only refer the matter to the Bishop.I am not
connected with this diocese.But I
shall be most pleased to lay it before him, with my endorsement.""As you say, Monsignor," sweetly responded the gracious Mrs."I sought your advice because I had met you through my
dear friend, Madam Beaubien.""It has been a great pleasure to know you and to be of service to you,
Madam," said Monsignor, rising to depart."But," he added with a
tender smile, "a pleasure that would be enhanced were you to become
one of us."Hawley-Crowles knew that at last the time had come."A moment,
please, Monsignor," she said, her heart beating quickly.It concerns my ward, the young girl
whom you met at Madam Beaubien's.""And just
budding into still more beautiful womanhood."Then she threw herself precipitately into her
topic, as if she feared further delay would result in the evaporation
of her boldness."Monsignor, it is, as you say, unfortunate that I
profess no religious convictions; and yet, as I have told you, I find
that as the years pass I lean ever more strongly toward your Church.Now you will pardon me when I say that I am sure it is the avowed
intention to make America dominantly Catholic that brings you to this
country to work toward that end--is it not so?"The man's handsome face lighted up pleasantly, but he did not reply."Now, Monsignor, I am going to be terribly frank; and if you
disapprove of what I suggest, we will both forget that the matter was
ever under discussion.To begin with, I heartily endorse your
missionary efforts in this godless country of ours.Nothing but the
strong arm of the Catholic Church, it seems to me, can check our
headlong plunge into ruin.But, Monsignor, you do not always work
where your labors are most needed.You may control political--"

"My dear lady," interrupted the man, holding up a hand and shaking his
head in gentle demurral, "the Catholic Church is not in politics.""But it is in society--or should be!""And
if the Catholic Church is to be supreme in America it must work from
the top down, as well as from the lower levels upward.At present our
wealthiest, most influential social set is absolutely domineered by a
Protestant--and under the influence of a Presbyterian minister at
that!Monsignor Lafelle's eyes twinkled, as he listened politely.But he
only stroked the white hair that crowned his shapely head, and
waited."Monsignor," continued the now thoroughly heated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles,
"why do not the women of your Church constitute our society leaders?Why do you not recognize the desirability of forcing your people into
every avenue of human activity?And would you resent a suggestion from
me as to how in one instance this might be accomplished?""Certainly not, Madam," replied Monsignor, with an expression of
wonder on his face."You are laughing at me, I do believe!"she exclaimed, catching the
glint in his gray eyes."Pardon me, dear lady, I really am deeply interested."Well, at any rate I have your promise to forget this conversation if
you do not approve of it," she said quizzically.He nodded his head to inspire her confidence; and she continued:

"Very well, now to the point.My ward, the little Inca princess, is
coming out shortly.I want her to have the _entree_ into the very best
society, into the most fashionable and exclusive set, as befitting her
rank."She stopped and awaited the effect of her words.Monsignor studied her for a moment, and then broke into a genial
laugh."There is nothing reprehensible in your wish, Madam," he said."Our social system, however imperfect, nevertheless exists,
and--dominant Catholic influence might improve it."Why, I really see nothing that I can do," he replied slowly.Hawley-Crowles was becoming exasperated with his apparent
dullness."You can do much," she retorted in a tone tinctured with
impatience."Since I have made you my Father Confessor to-day, I am
going to tell you that I intend to start a social war that will rip
this city wide open.It is going to be war in which Catholic is pitted
against Protestant.For a moment her blunt question startled him, and he stared at her
uncomprehendingly; but he quickly recovered his poise and replied
calmly, "Neither, Madam; it remains quite neutral.""Pardon me if I say it; not at all."she murmured, her eagerness subsiding."Then I've made an awful
mistake!""No," he amended gently, "you have made a good friend.And, as such, I
again urge you first to respect the leaning which you mentioned a
moment ago and become actively affiliated with our Church here in New
York."Certainly I will consider it," she responded, brightening with hope."And I will go so far as to say that I have long had it in mind.""Then, Madam, when that is accomplished, we may discuss the less
important matter of your ward's entrance into society--is it not so?"Hawley-Crowles rose, completely discomfited."But the girl,
Monsignor, is already a Catholic--comes from a Catholic country.It is
she whom I am pitting against the Protestant.""You are cruel," she retorted, affecting an air of injured innocence
as she stood before him with downcast eyes."But--if you--"

"Madam," said Monsignor, "plainly, what is it that you wish me to
do?"The sudden propounding of the question drew an equally sudden but less
thoughtful response."Tell the Beau--Madam Beaubien that you wish my ward to be received
into the best society, and for the reasons I have given you."And is my influence with Madam Beaubien, and hers with the members of
fashionable society, sufficient to effect that?"he asked, an odd look
coming into his eyes."She has but to say the word to J. Wilton Ames, and his wife will
receive us both," said the woman, carried away by her eagerness."And
that means strong Catholic influence in New York's most aristocratic
set!""Monsignor," continued the woman eagerly, "will your Church receive an
altar from me in memory of my late husband?"Then, slowly, and in a low, earnest tone, "It
would receive such a gift from one of the faith.When may we expect
you to become a communicant?"The woman paled, and her heart suddenly chilled.She had wondered how
far she might go with this clever churchman, and now she knew that she
had gone too far.But to retract--to have him relate this conversation
and her retraction to the Beaubien--were fatal!She had set her
trap--and walked into it.Then,
raising her eyes and meeting his searching glance, she murmured
feebly, "Whenever you say, Monsignor."When the man had departed, which he did immediately, the plotting
woman threw herself upon the davenport and wept with rage."Belle,"
she wailed, as her wondering sister entered the room, "I'm going to
join the Catholic Church!But I'd go through Sheol to beat that Ames
outfit!"CHAPTER 11


MONSIGNOR LAFELLE made another afternoon call on the Beaubien a few
days later.That lady, fresh from her bath, scented, powdered, and
charming in a loose, flowing Mandarin robe, received him graciously."But I can give you only a moment, Monsignor," she said, waving him to
a chair, while she stooped and tenderly took up the two spaniels."I
have a dinner to-night, and so shall not listen unless you have
something fresh and really worth while to offer.""My dear Madam," said he, bowing low before he sank into the great
leather armchair, "you are charming, and the Church is justly proud of
you.""Tut, tut, my friend," she returned, knitting her brows."That may be
fresh, I admit, but not worth listening to.And if you persist in that
vein I shall be obliged to have William set you into the street.""I can not apologize for voicing the truth, dear Madam," he replied,
as his eyes roved admiringly over her comely figure."The Church has
never ceased to claim you, however far you may have wandered from her.I am leaving for Canada shortly on a mission of
some importance.May I not take with me the consoling assurance that
you have at last heard and yielded to the call of the tender Mother,
who has never ceased to yearn for her beautiful, wayward daughter?""There," she said gently, "I thought
that was it.No, Monsignor, no," shaking her head."When only a wild,
thoughtless girl I became a Catholic in order that I might marry
Gaspard de Beaubien.The priest urged; and I--<DW30>!But
the past eighteen years have confirmed me in some views; and one is
that I shall gain nothing, either here or hereafter, by renewing my
allegiance to the Church of Rome."Monsignor sighed, and stroked his abundant white hair."I learned this morning," he said musingly, "that my
recent labors with the Dowager Duchess of Altern in England have not
been vain.She has become a communicant of Holy Church.""The Duchess of Altern--sister of Mrs.Why, she was a high Anglican--"

"Only a degree below the true Church, Madam.Her action is but
anticipatory of a sweeping return of the entire Anglican Church to the
true fold.And I learn further," he went on, "that the Duchess will
spend the winter in New York with her sister.Which means, of course,
an unusually gay season here, does it not?"The Beaubien quickly recovered from her astonishment."Well,
Monsignor," she laughed, "for once you really are interesting.Ames herself will be the next
convert?But one of your most intimate friends will
become a communicant of Holy Saints next Sunday."The Beaubien set the spaniels down
on the floor."Now, my dear Monsignor, you are positively refreshing."Am I not right when I insist that you have
wandered far, dear Madam?It is not 'he,' but'she,' your dear friend,
Mrs.The Beaubien's mouth opened wide and she sat suddenly upright and
gazed blankly at her raconteur.The man went on, apparently oblivious
of the effect his information had produced."Her beautiful ward, who
is to make her bow to society this winter, is one of us by birth.""Then you have been at work on Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward, have
you?"said the Beaubien severely, and there was a threatening note in
her voice."Why," returned Monsignor easily, "the lady sent for me to express her
desire to become affiliated with the Church.And I
have had no conversation with the girl, I assure you."Then:

"Will you tell me why, Monsignor, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles takes this
unusual step?"Is it unusual, Madam, for a woman who has seen much of the
world to turn from it to the solace and promise of the Church?"Hawley-Crowles it
is, decidedly."Monsignor, I do not.And by this time you
do, too.She is the last woman in the world to turn from it.""But the question you have just propounded reflects seriously upon
both the Church and me--"

"Bah!"interjected the Beaubien, her eyes flashing."Wait," she
commanded imperiously, as he rose."I have a few things to say to you,
since this is to be your last call.""Madam, not the last, I hope.For I shall not cease to plead the cause
of the Church to you--"

"Surely, Monsignor, that is your business.You are welcome in my
house at any time, and particularly when you have such delightful
scraps of gossip as these which you have brought to-day.But, a word
before you go, lest you become indiscreet on your return.Hawley-Crowles to any extent you wish, but let her ward
alone--_absolutely_!The cold, even tone in which the woman said this left no doubt in the
man's mind of her meaning.She was not trifling with him now, he knew.In her low-voiced words he found no trace of banter, of sophistry, nor
of aught that he might in any wise misinterpret."Now, Monsignor, I have some influence in New York, as you may
possibly know.Will you admit that I can do much for or against you?Drop your mask, therefore, and tell me frankly just what has induced
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to unite with your Church."The man knew he was pitting his own against a master mind.He
hesitated and weighed well his words before replying."Madam," said he
at length, with a note of reproach, "you misjudge the lady, the
Church, and me, its humble servant.Hawley-Crowles, I speak truly when I say that doubtless she
has been greatly influenced by love for her late husband."The Beaubien half rose from her chair."Jim Crowles--that raw,
Irish boob, who was holding down a job on the police force until Ames
found he could make a convenient tool of him!The man who was
Gannette's cat's-paw in the Fall River franchise steal!Now,
Monsignor, would you have me believe you devoid of all sense?""But," ejaculated the man, now becoming exasperated, and for the
moment so losing his self-control as to make wretched use of his
facts, "she is erecting an altar in Holy Saints as a memorial to
him!"Monsignor Lafelle again made as if to rise.He felt that he was guilty
of a miserable _faux pas_."Madam, I regret that I must be leaving.But the hour--"

"Stay, Monsignor!"The Beaubien roused up and laid a detaining hand
upon his arm."Our versatile friend, what other projects has she in
hand?"Why, really, I can not say--beyond the fact that the girl is to be
introduced to society this winter."Going to make a try for the Ames set?""That, I believe, Madam, would be useless without your aid."Hawley-Crowles say so, Monsignor?"demanded the woman,
leaning forward eagerly."Why, I believe I am not abusing her confidence when I say that she
intimated as much," he said, watching her closely and sparring now
with better judgment.Ames as New York's
fashionable society leader--"

"There is no such position as leader in New York society, Monsignor,"
interrupted the Beaubien coldly."There are sets and cliques, and
Mrs.Ames happens to be prominent in the one which at present
foolishly imagines it constitutes the upper stratum.Hawley-Crowles, with nothing but a tarnished name and a large bank
account to recommend her, now wishes to break into that clique and
attain social leadership, does she?Then the woman's eyes narrowed and grew hard.Leaning closer to
the churchman, she rested the tip of her finger on his knee."So, Monsignor," she said, with cold precision, "this is Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's method of renouncing the world, is it?And she would use both you and me, eh?And you are her ambassador
at the court of the Beaubien?Very well, then, she shall use us.But you and I will first make this compact, my dear Monsignor:
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles shall be taken into the so-called 'Ames set,'
and you shall cease importuning me to return to your Church, and
what is more, shall promise to have no conversation on church
matters with her ward, the young girl.If you do not agree to
this, Monsignor, I shall set in motion forces that will make your
return to New York quite undesirable."When she concluded, she
looked long and steadily into his eyes.Monsignor got slowly to his feet.he exclaimed in a hoarse
whisper, "my astonishment--"

"There," she said calmly, as she rose and took his hand, "please omit
the dramatics, Monsignor.And now you must go, for to-night I
entertain, and I have already given you more time than I intended.But, Monsignor, do you in future work with or against me?"Why, Madam," he replied quickly, "we could never be the latter!""And you always respect the wishes of a friend, especially if she is a
lady, do you not?""Always, Madam," he returned after a moment's hesitation, as he bowed
low over her hand.And, Monsignor," she added, when he reached the door,
"I shall be pleased to attend the dedication of the Hawley-Crowles
altar."When Monsignor's car glided away from her door the Beaubien's face
grew dark, and her eyes drew to narrow slits."So," she reflected, as
she entered the elevator to mount to her dressing room, "that is her
game, is it?The poor, fat simpleton has no interest in either the
girl or myself, other than to use us as stepping-stones.She forgets
that a stone sometimes turns under the foot.She entered her room and rang for her maid.Turning to the pier glass,
she threw on the electric light and scrutinized her features narrowly."It's going," she murmured, "fast!Oh, what a farce life is--what a howling, mocking farce!No--that little girl--if it is possible
for me to love, I love her.""I wonder what it is she does to me.I'm
hypnotized, I guess.Anyhow, I'm different when I'm with her.And to
think that Hawley-Crowles would sacrifice the child--humph!But, if
the girl is made of the right stuff--and I know she is--she will stand
up under it and be stronger for the experience.She has got something
that will make her stand!I once asked her what she had that I didn't,
and now I know--it is her religion, the religion that Borwell and
Lafelle and the whole kit of preachers and priests would corrupt if
they had half a chance!Very well, we'll see what it does under the
test.If it saves her, then I want it myself.But, as for that little
pin-headed Hawley-Crowles, she's already signed her own death-warrant.She shall get into the Ames set, yes.And I will use her, oh,
beautifully!to pay off certain old scores against Madam Ames--and
then I'll crush her like a dried leaf, the fat fool!"The Beaubien's position was, to say the least, peculiar, and one which
required infinite tact on her part to protect.It was for that reason
that the decorum which prevailed at her dinners was so rigidly
observed, and that, whatever the moral status of the man who sat at
her board, his conduct was required to be above reproach, on penalty
of immediate ejection from the circle of financial pirates, captains
of commercial jugglery, and political intriguers who made these feasts
opportunities for outlining their predatory campaigns against that
most anomalous of creatures, the common citizen.It was about this table, at whose head always sat the richly gowned
Beaubien, that the inner circle of financial kings had gathered almost
nightly for years to rig the market, determine the price of wheat or
cotton, and develop mendacious schemes of stock-jobbery whose golden
harvests they could calculate almost to a dollar before launching.As
the wealth of this clique of financial manipulators swelled beyond all
bounds, so increased their power, until at last it could be justly
said that, when Ames began to dominate the Stock Exchange, the
Beaubien practically controlled Wall Street--and, therefore, in a
sense, Washington itself.But always with a tenure of control
dubiously dependent upon the caprices of the men who continued to pay
homage to her personal charm and keen, powerful intellect.At the time of which we speak her power was at its zenith, and she
could with equal impunity decapitate the wealthiest, most aristocratic
society dame, or force the door of the most exclusive set for any
protegee who might have been kept long years knocking in vain, or
whose family name, perchance, headed a list of indictments for gross
peculations.At these unicameral meetings, held in the great, dark,
mahogany-wainscoted dining room of the Beaubien mansion, where a
single lamp of priceless workmanship threw a flood of light upon the
sumptuous table beneath and left the rest of the closely guarded room
shrouded in Stygian darkness, plans were laid and decrees adopted
which seated judges, silenced clergymen, elected senators, and
influenced presidents.There a muck-raking, hostile press was muffled.There business opposition was crushed and competition throttled.There
tax rates were determined and tariff schedules formulated.There
public opinion was disrupted, character assassinated, and the
death-warrant of every threatening reformer drawn and signed.In a
word, there Mammon, in the _role_ of business, organized and
unorganized, legitimate and piratical, sat enthroned, with wires
leading into every mart of the world, and into every avenue of human
endeavor, be it social, political, commercial, or religious.These
wires were gathered together into the hands of one man, the directing
genius of the group, J. Wilton Ames.Over him lay the shadow of the
Beaubien.An hour after the departure of Monsignor Lafelle the Beaubien, like a
radiant sun, descended to the library to greet her assembled guests.Some moments later the heavy doors of the great dining room swung
noiselessly open, and the lady proceeded unescorted to her position at
the head of the table.At her signal the half dozen men sat down, and
the butler immediately entered, followed by two serving men with the
cocktails and the first course.The chair at the far end of the table,
opposite the Beaubien, remained unoccupied."Ames is late to-night," observed the girthy Gannette, glancing toward
the vacant seat, and clumsily attempting to tuck his napkin into his
collar.The Beaubien looked sharply at him."Were you at the club this
afternoon, Mr.Gannette straightened up and became rigid.Pulling the napkin down
hastily, he replied in a thick voice, "Just a little game of
bridge--some old friends--back from Europe--"

The Beaubien turned to the butler.Gannette is not
drinking wine this evening."The butler bowed and removed the glasses
from that gentleman's place."Now, Lucile--" he began peevishly.The Beaubien held up a hand.Gannette glowered and sank down in his
chair like a swollen toad."May be Ames is trying to break into the C. and R. directors'
meeting," suggested Weston, himself a director in a dozen companies,
and a bank president besides."They tell me," said Fitch, "that for once Ames has been outwitted,
and that by a little bucket-shop broker named Ketchim."queried Kane, Board of Trade plunger, and the most
mettlesome speculator of the group."Why," explained Weston, "some months ago Ames tried to reach Ed.Stolz through Ketchim, the old man's nephew, and get control of C. and
R. But friend nephew dropped the portcullis just as Ames was dashing
across the drawbridge, and J. Wilton found himself outside, looking
through the bars.First time I've ever known that to happen.Now the
boys have got hold of it on 'Change, and Ames has been getting it from
every quarter.""Long time leaking out, seems to me," remarked Kane."But what's Ames
going to do about it?""He seems to have dropped the
matter.""I think you will find yourself mistaken," put in the Beaubien
evenly.queried Fitch, as all eyes turned upon the woman.Ames always gets what he goes
after, and he will secure control of C. and R.vigorously asserted Murdock, who had been an
interested listener."I have one thousand dollars that says he will," said the Beaubien,
calmly regarding the speaker.Murdock seemed taken back for the moment; but lost no time recovering
his poise.Drawing out his own book he wrote a check in the Beaubien's
name for the amount and sent it down the table to her.Fitch will hold the stakes," said the woman, handing him the two
slips of paper."And we will set a time limit of eighteen months.""By the way," remarked Peele, the only one of the group who had taken
no part in the preceding conversation, "I see by the evening paper
that there's been another accident in the Avon mills.Fellow named
Marcus caught in a machine and crushed all out of shape.That's the
third one down there this month.They'll force Ames to equip his mills
with safety devices if this keeps up.""Not while the yellow metal has any influence upon the Legislature,"
returned the Beaubien with a knowing smile."But," she added more
seriously, "that is not where the danger lies.The real source of
apprehension is in the possibility of a strike.And if war breaks out
among those Hungarians down there it will cost him more than to equip
all his mills now with safety devices."Gannette, who had been sulking in his chair, roused up."Speaking
of war," he growled, "has Ames, or any of you fellows, got a
finger in the muddle in South America?I've got interests down
there--concessions and the like--and by--!"He wandered off into
incoherent mutterings.The Beaubien gave a sharp command to the butler.cried Gannette, his apoplectic face becoming
more deeply purple, and his blear eyes leering angrily upon the calm
woman."I ain't a-goin' to stand this!I'm as sober
as any one here, an'--" William took the heavy man gently by the arm
and persuaded him to his feet.The other guests suppressed their
smiles and remained discreetly quiet."Have Henri take him to his club, William," said the Beaubien, rising.We will expect you Wednesday evening, and
we trust that we will not have to accept your excuses again."Gannette was led soddenly out.The Beaubien quietly resumed her seat.It was the second time the man had been dismissed from her table, and
the guests marveled that it did not mean the final loss of her favor.But she remained inscrutable; and the conversation quickly drifted
into new channels.A few moments later William returned and made a
quiet announcement:

"Mr.A huge presence emerged from the darkness into the light.The Beaubien
immediately rose and advanced to greet the newcomer.she
whispered, taking his hand.The man smiled down into her upturned, anxious face.His only reply
was a reassuring pressure of her hand.But she comprehended, and her
face brightened."Gentlemen," remarked Ames, taking the vacant chair, "the President's
message is out.I have been going over it with Hood--which accounts
for my tardiness," he added, nodding pleasantly to the Beaubien."Quoting from our chief executive's long list of innocent platitudes,
I may say that 'private monopoly is criminally unjust, wholly
indefensible, and not to be tolerated in a Republic founded upon the
premise of equal rights to all mankind.'"concurred Weston, holding up his glass and gazing
admiringly at the rich color of the wine."Quite my sentiments, too," murmured Fitch,
rolling his eyes upward and attempting with poor success to assume a
beatific expression."Furthermore," continued Ames, with mock gravity, "the interlocking of
corporation directorates must be prohibited by law; power must be
conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission to superintend the
financial management of railroads; holding-companies must cease to
exist; and corrective policies must be shaped, whereby so-called
'trusts' will be regulated and rendered innocuous."We are," said they all, in one voice."Carried," concluded Ames in a solemn tone.Then a burst of laughter
rose from the table; and even the inscrutable William smiled behind
his hand."But, seriously," said Weston, when the laughter had ceased, "I
believe we've got a President now who's going to do something, don't
you?""As long as the human mind
remains as it is there is nothing to fear, though Congress legislate
itself blue in the face.Reform is not to be made like a garment and
forced upon the people from the outside.Restrictive measures have not as yet, in all the history of
civilization, reformed a single criminal.""That we are puncture-proof," replied Ames with a light laugh."But what about your indictment in that cotton deal?Is Hood going to
find you law-proof there?""The case is settled," said Ames easily."I went into court this
morning and plead guilty to the indictment for conspiring to corner
the cotton market two years ago.I admitted that I violated the
Sherman law.The judge promptly fined me three thousand dollars, for
which I immediately wrote a check, leaving me still the winner by some
two million seven hundred thousand dollars on the deal, to say nothing
of compound interest on the three thousand for the past two years.You
see the beneficent effect of legislation, do you not?""By George, Ames, you certainly were stingy not to let us in on that!""Cotton belongs to me, gentlemen," replied Ames simply."Well," remarked Fitch, glancing about the table, "suppose we get down
to the business of the evening--if agreeable to our hostess," bowing
in the direction of the Beaubien."Has any one
anything new to offer?""There is a little
matter," he began, "that I have been revolving for some days.It occurred to
me some time ago that a franchise for a trolley line on that road
could be secured and ultimately sold for a round figure to the wealthy
residents whose estates lie along it, and who would give a million
dollars rather than have a line built there.After some preliminary
examination I got Hood to draft a bill providing for the building of
the road, and submitted it to Jacobson, Commissioner of Highways.He
reported that it would be the means of destroying the post road.I
convinced him, on the other hand, that it would be the means of lining
his purse with fifty thousand dollars.So he very naturally gave it
his endorsement.I then got in consultation with Senator Gossitch, and
had him arrange a meeting with the Governor, in Albany.I think," he
concluded, "that about five hundred thousand dollars will grease the
wheels all 'round.I've got the Governor on the hip in that Southern
Mexican deal, and he is at present eating out of my hand.I'll lay
this project on the table now, and you can take it up if you so
desire.""The scheme seems all right," commented Weston, after a short
meditation."Well, a net profit of half a million to split up among us would at
least provide for a yachting party next summer," remarked Ames
sententiously."And no work connected with it--in fact, the work has
been done.I shall want an additional five per cent for handling it."An animated discussion followed; and then Fitch offered a motion that
the group definitely take up the project.The Beaubien put the vote,
and it was carried without dissent."What about that potato scheme you were figuring on, Ames?"asked
Fitch at this juncture."I didn't get much encouragement from my
friends," he replied."I don't believe it," put in Weston emphatically."I have one million dollars that says it could," returned Ames calmly.Weston threw up his hands in token of surrender.he
exclaimed, scurrying for cover."Well," he said, "suppose we look into the scheme and
see if we don't want to handle it.It simply calls for a little
thought and work.He stopped and glanced at the Beaubien for approval.She nodded, and
he went on:

"I have lately been investigating the subject of various food supplies
other than wheat and corn as possible bases for speculation, and my
attention has been drawn strongly to a very humble one, potatoes."But Ames continued
unperturbed:

"I find that in some sections of the West potatoes are so plentiful at
times that they bring but twenty cents a bushel.My investigations
have covered a period of several months, and now I have in my
possession a large map of the United States with the potato sections,
prices, freight rates and all other necessary data indicated.My idea is to send agents into all these
sections next summer before the potatoes are turned up, and contract
for the entire crop at twenty-five cents a bushel.The agents will pay
the farmers cash, and agree to assume all expenses of digging,
packing, shipping, and so forth, allowing the farmer to take what he
needs for his own consumption.Needless to say, the potatoes will not
be removed from the fields, but will be allowed to rot in the ground.Those that do reach the market will sell for a dollar and a half in
New York and Chicago.""In other words," added Fitch, "you are simply figuring to corner the
market for the humble tuber, eh?""But--you say you have all the necessary data now?""All, even to the selection of a few of my agents.I can control
freight rates for what we may wish to ship.The rest of the crop will
be left to rot.And the
consumers will pay our price for what they must have.""And how much do you figure we shall
need to round the corner?""A million, cash in hand," replied Ames."Is this anything that the women can mix into?""You know they forced us to dump tons of our cold-storage stuff onto
the market two years ago.""That was when I controlled wheat," said Ames, "and was all tied up.It will be done so quietly
and thoroughly that it will all be over and the profits pocketed
before the women wake up to what we're doing.In this case there will
be nothing to store.And potatoes exposed in the field rot quickly,
you know."The rest of the group seemed to study the idea for some moments.Then
the practical Murdock inquired of Ames if he would agree to handle the
project, provided they took it up."Yes," assented Ames, "on a five per cent basis.And I am ready to put
agents in the field to-morrow.""Then, Madam Beaubien," said Fitch, "I move that we adopt the plan as
set forth by Mr.Ames, and commission him to handle it, calling upon
us equally for whatever funds he may need."A further brief discussion ensued; and then the resolution was
unanimously adopted."Say, Ames," queried Weston, with a glint of mischief in his eyes,
"will any of these potatoes be shipped over the C. and R.?"A laugh
went up around the table, in which Ames himself joined."Yes," he
said, "potatoes and cotton will both go over that road next summer,
and I shall fix the rebates."suggested Fitch, with a wink at
Murdock.Ames's mouth set grimly, and the smile left his face."Ketchim is
going to Sing Sing for that little deal," he returned in a low, cold
tone, so cold that even the Beaubien could not repress a little
shudder."I had him on Molino, but he trumped up a new company which
absorbed Molino and satisfied everybody, so I am blocked for the
present.But, mark me, I shall strip him of every dollar, and then put
him behind the bars before I've finished!"And no one sought to refute the man, for they knew he spoke truth.At midnight, while the cathedral chimes in the great hall clock were
sending their trembling message through the dark house, the Beaubien
rose, and the dinner was concluded.A few moments later the guests
were spinning in their cars to their various homes or clubs--all but
Ames.As he was preparing to leave, the Beaubien laid a hand on his
arm."Wait a moment, Wilton," she said."I have something important to
discuss with you."She led him into the morning room, where a fire was
blazing cheerily in the grate, and drew up a chair before it for him,
then nestled on the floor at his feet."I sent Gannette home this evening," she began, by way of introduction.I would drop him entirely, only you said--"

"We need him," interrupted Ames."I'll soil my hands by doing it; but it is for you.Now tell me," she
went on eagerly, "what about Colombia?Have you any further news from
Wenceslas?"The Church is
with the Government, and they will win--although your money may be
tied up for a few years.Still, you can't lose in the end."The woman sat for some moments gazing into the fire.Then:

"Lafelle was here again to-day.""Hold him, too," said Ames quickly."Looks as if I had made you a sort
of holding company, doesn't it?""But we
shall have good use for these fellows.""He gave me some very interesting news," she said; and then went on to
relate the conversation in detail.Ames laughed loudly as he
listened."And now, Wilton," said the Beaubien, a determined look
coming into her face, "you have always said that you never forgave me
for making you let Jim Crowles off, when you had him by the throat.Well, I'm going to give you a chance to get more than even.Jim's fat
widow is after your wife's scalp.I intend that she shall lose her own
in the chase.I've got my plans all laid, and I want your wife to meet
the lovely Mrs.Hawley-Crowles at the Fitch's next Thursday afternoon.It will be just a formal call--mutual introductions--and, later, an
invitation from Mrs.Meantime, I want you
to get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles involved in a financial way, and shear her
of every penny!"My dear," said he, taking her hand, "you are charming this
evening.she deprecated, although the smile she gave him
attested her pleasure in the compliment."Well," she continued
briskly, "if I'm so beautiful, you can't help loving me; and if you
love me, you will do what I ask."Really,
I've long since forgotten him.Do you realize that that was more than
ten years ago?""Please don't mention years, dear," she murmured, shuddering a little."Tell me, what can we do to teach this fat hussy a lesson?""Well," he suggested, laughing, "we might get Ketchim after her, to
sell her a wad of his worthless stocks; then when he goes down, as he
is going one of these days, we will hope that it will leave her on the
rocks of financial ruin, eh?""Why, among other innocent novelties, a scheme bearing the sonorous
title of Simiti Development Company, I am told by my brokers."Why--I've heard Carmen mention that name.I wonder--"

"Well, and who is Carmen?""My little friend--the one and only honest person I've ever dealt
with, excepting, of course, present company."And now where does this Carmen enter the
game?""Why, she's--surely you know about her!""Well, she is a little Colombian--"

"Colombian!"Came up with the engineers who
went down there for Ketchim to examine the Molino properties.She
lived all her life in a town called Simiti until she came up here."Ames leaned over and looked steadily into the fire."Never heard of
the place," he murmured dreamily."Well," said the Beaubien eagerly, "she's a--a wonderful child!I'm
different when I'm with her."He roused from his meditations and smiled down at the woman."Then I'd
advise you not to be with her much, for I prefer you as you are."Then the woman looked up at her
companion.The man started; then drew himself up and gave a little nervous laugh."Of you," he replied evasively, "always."She reached up and slapped his cheek tenderly."You were dreaming of
your awful business deals," she said."What have you in hand
now?--besides the revolution in Colombia, your mines, your mills, your
banks, your railroads and trolley lines, your wheat and potato
corners, your land concessions and cattle schemes, and--well, that's a
start, at least," she finished, pausing for breath.I'm buying every bale I can find, in Europe, Asia, and
the States.""But, Will, you've been caught in cotton before, you know.And I don't
believe you can get away with it again.Unless--"

"That's it--unless," he interrupted."And that's just the part I have
taken care of.The cotton schedule will go
through as I have it outlined.They
don't dare refuse to pass the measure.In a few
months the tariff on cotton products will be up.The new tariff-wall
sends the price of raw stuff soaring.I
was beaten on the last deal simply because of faulty weather
prognostications.I'll let you in, if you wish.But these other fellows have got
to stay out.""I haven't a penny to invest, Will," she replied mournfully."You got
me so terribly involved in this Colombian revolution.""Oh, well," he returned easily, "I'll lend you what you need, any
amount.And you can give me your advice and suggestions from time to
time.As for your Colombian investments, haven't I guaranteed them,
practically?""Not in writing," she said, looking up at him with a twinkle in her
eyes."No, certainly not," she returned, giving him a glance of admiration.Hawley-Crowles is going to be received into your
wife's set, and you are going to give her a good financial whipping?"Hawley-Crowles
shall go to the poor-house, if you say the word.But now, my dear,
have William order my car.Hawley-Crowles at Fitch's?"Yes, dear," murmured the Beaubien, reaching up and kissing him; "next
Thursday at three.Call me on the 'phone to-morrow."CHAPTER 12


The Ames building, a block from the Stock Exchange, was originally
only five stories in height.But as the Ames interests grew, floor
after floor was added, until, on the day that Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
pointed it out to Carmen from the window of her limousine, it had
reached, tower and all, a height of twenty-five stories, and was
increasing at an average rate of two additional a year.It was not its
size that aroused interest, overtopped as it was by many others, but
its uniqueness; for, though a hive of humming industry, it did not
house a single business that was not either owned outright or
controlled by J. Wilton Ames, from the lowly cigar stands in the
marble corridors to the great banking house of Ames and Company on the
second floor.The haberdashers, the shoe-shining booths, the soda
fountains, and the great commercial enterprises that dwelt about them,
each and all acknowledged fealty and paid homage to the man who
brooded over them in his magnificent offices on the twenty-fifth floor
in the tower above.It was not by any consensus of opinion among the financiers of New
York that Ames had assumed leadership, but by sheer force of what
was doubtless the most dominant character developed in recent
years by those peculiar forces which have produced the American
multimillionaire."And," he once added, when, despite his anger, he could
not but admire Ames's tactical blocking of his piratical move, which
the former's keen foresight had perceived threatened danger at
Washington, "it is not by any tacit agreement that we accept him,
but because he knows ten tricks to our one, that's all."To look at the man, now in his forty-fifth year, meant, generally, an
expression of admiration for his unusual physique, and a wholly
erroneous appraisal of his character.His build was that of a
gladiator.He stood six-feet-four in height, with Herculean shoulders
and arms, and a pair of legs that suggested nothing so much as the
great pillars which supported the facade of the Ames building.Those
arms and legs, and those great back-muscles, had sent his college
shell to victory every year that he had sat in the boat.They had won
every game on the gridiron in which he had participated as the
greatest "center" the college ever developed.For baseball he was a
bit too massive, much to his own disappointment, but the honors he
failed to secure there he won in the field events, and in the
surreptitiously staged boxing and wrestling bouts when, hidden away in
the cellar of some secret society hall, he would crush his opponents
with an ease and a peculiar glint of satisfaction in his gray eyes
that was grimly prophetic of days to come.His mental attitude toward
contests for superiority of whatever nature did not differ essentially
from that of the Roman gladiators: he entered them to win.If he fell,
well and good; he expected "thumbs down."If he won, his opponent need
look for no exhibition of generosity on his part.When his man lay
prone before him, he stooped and cut his throat.And he would have
loathed the one who forbore to do likewise with himself.In scholarship he might have won a place, had not the physical side of
his nature been so predominant, and his remarkable muscular strength
so great a prize to the various athletic coaches and directors.Ames
was first an animal; there was no stimulus as yet sufficiently strong
to arouse his latent spirituality.And yet his intellect was keen; and
to those studies to which he was by nature or inheritance especially
attracted, economics, banking, and all branches of finance, he brought
a power of concentration that was as stupendous as his physical
strength.His mental make-up was peculiar, in that it was the epitome
of energy--manifested at first only in brute force--and in that it was
wholly deficient in the sense of fear.Because of this his daring was
phenomenal.Immediately upon leaving college Ames became associated with his
father in the already great banking house of Ames and Company.But the
animality of his nature soon found the confinement irksome; his
father's greater conservatism hampered his now rapidly expanding
spirit of commercialism; and after a few years in the banking house he
withdrew and set up for himself.The father, while lacking the boy's
fearlessness, had long since recognized dominant qualities in him
which he himself did not possess, and he therefore confidently
acquiesced in his son's desire, and, in addition, gave him _carte
blanche_ in the matter of funds for his speculative enterprises.Four years later J. Wilton Ames, rich in his own name, already
becoming recognized as a power in the world of finance, with
diversified enterprises which reached into almost every country of the
globe, hastened home from a foreign land in response to a message
announcing the sudden death of his father.The devolving of his
parent's vast fortune upon himself--he was the sole heir--then
necessitated his permanent location in New York.And so, reluctantly
giving up his travels, he gathered his agents and lieutenants about
him, concentrating his interests as much as possible in the Ames
building, and settled down to the enjoyment of expanding his huge
fortune.A few months later he married, and the union amalgamated the
proud old Essex stock of Ames, whose forbears fought under the
Conqueror and were written in the Doomsday Book, to the wealthy and
aristocratic Van Heyse branch of old Amsterdam.To this union were
born a son and a daughter, twins.The interval between his graduation from college and the death of his
father was all but unknown to the cronies of his subsequent years in
New York.Though he had spent much of it in the metropolis, he had
been self-centered and absorbed, even lonely, while laying his plans
and developing the schemes which resulted in financial preeminence.With unlimited money at his disposal, he was unhampered in the choice
of his business clientele, and he formed it from every quarter of the
globe.Much of his time had been spent abroad, and he had become as
well known on the Paris bourse and the exchanges of Europe as in his
native land.Confident and successful from the outset; without any
trace of pride or touch of hauteur in his nature; as wholly lacking in
ethical development and in generosity as he was in fear; gradually
becoming more sociable and companionable, although still reticent of
certain periods of his past; his cunning and brutality increasing with
years; and his business sagacity and keen strategy becoming the talk
of the Street; with no need to raise his eyes beyond the low plane of
his material endeavors; he pursued his business partly for the
pleasure the game afforded him, partly for the power which his
accumulations bestowed upon him, and mostly because it served as an
adequate outlet for his tremendous, almost superhuman, driving energy.If he betrayed and debauched ideals, it was because he was utterly
incapable of rising to them, nor felt the stimulus to make the
attempt.If he achieved no noble purpose, it was because when he
glanced at the mass of humanity about him he looked through the lenses
of self.His glance fell always first upon J. Wilton Ames--and he
never looked beyond.The world had been created for him; the cosmos
but expressed his Ego.On the morning after his conversation with the Beaubien regarding the
social aspirations of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the financier sat at his
rich mahogany desk on the top floor of the Ames building in earnest
discussion with his lawyer, Alonzo Hood.The top floor of the tower
was divided into eight rooms.Two of these constituted Ames's inner
_sanctum_; one was Hood's private office; and the rest were devoted
to clerks and stenographers.A telegrapher occupied an alcove
adjoining Hood's room, and handled confidential messages over
private wires to the principal cities in the country.A private
telephone connected Ames's desk with the Beaubien mansion.Private
lines ran to the Stock Exchange and to various other points
throughout the city.The telegraph and telephone companies gave his
messages preference over all others.At a word he would be placed in
almost instant communication with New Orleans, San Francisco, London,
Berlin, or Cairo.Private lines and speaking tubes ran to every room
or floor of the building where a company, firm, or individual was
doing business.At the office of the Telegraph Service up-town he
maintained messengers who carried none but his own despatches.In
the railroad yards his private car stood always in readiness; and in
the harbor his yacht was kept constantly under steam.A motor car
stood ever in waiting in the street below, close to the shaft of a
private automatic elevator, which ran through the building for his
use alone.This elevator also penetrated the restaurant in the
basement of the building, where a private room and a special waiter
were always at the man's disposal.A private room and special
attendant were maintained in the Turkish baths adjoining, and he
had his own personal suite and valet at his favorite club up-town.This morning he was at his desk, as usual, at eight o'clock.Before
him lay the various daily reports from his mines, his mills, his
railroads, and his bank.These disposed of, there followed a quick
survey of the day's appointments, arranged for him by his chief
secretary.As the latter entered, Ames was
absorbed in the legend of the stock ticker."C. and R. closed yesterday at twenty-six," he commented.Then,
swinging back in his chair, "What's Stolz doing?""For one thing, he has made Miss Fagin his private stenographer,"
replied Hood."Now we will begin to get real information," he
remarked."Tell Miss Fagin you will give her fifty dollars a week from
now on; but she is to deliver to you a carbon copy of every letter she
writes for Stolz.And I want those copies on my desk every morning
when I come down.Hood," he continued, abruptly turning the
conversation, "what have you dug up about Ketchim's new company?""Very little, sir," replied Hood with a trace of embarrassment."His
lawyer is a fledgeling named Cass, young, but wise enough not to talk.I called on him yesterday afternoon to have a little chat about the
old Molino company, representing that I was speaking for certain
stockholders.But he told me to bring the stockholders in and he would
talk with them personally."Ames laughed, while the lawyer grinned sheepishly."Is that the sort
of service you are rendering for a hundred-thousand-dollar salary?""Hood, I'm ashamed of you!""I can't blame you; I am ashamed of myself," replied the lawyer."Well," continued Ames good-naturedly, "leave Ketchim to me.I've got
three men now buying small amounts of stock in his various companies.I'll call for receiverships pretty soon, and we will see this time
that he doesn't refund the money.Now about other matters: the Albany
post trolley deal is to go through.Work up
the details and let me have them at once.Have you got the senate bill
drawn for Gossitch?"As it stands now, the repealing
section gives any city the right to grant saloon licenses of
indefinite length, instead of for one year."We want the bill so drawn that it will become
practically impossible to revoke a license.""As it now reads," said Hood, "it makes a saloon license assignable.That creates a property right that can hardly be revoked.""As I figure, it will create a value of some
twenty millions for those who own saloons in New York.And if the United States ever reaches the point
where it will have to buy the saloons in order to wipe them out, it
will face a very handsome little expenditure."Ames, a very large part of the stock of American brewing
companies is owned in Europe.How are you--"

"Nominally, it is.But for two years, and more, I have been quietly
gathering in brewing stock from abroad, and to-day I have some ten
millions in my own control, from actual purchases, options, and so
forth.I'm going to organize a holding company, when the time arrives,
and I figure that within the next year or so we will practically
control the production of beer and spirituous liquors in the United
States and Europe.The formation of that company will be a task worthy
of your genius, Hood.""It will be a pleasure to undertake it," replied Hood with animation.Ames, I got in touch with Senator Mall last evening
at the club, and he assures me that the senate committee have so
changed the phraseology of the tariff bill on cotton products that the
clause you wish retained will be continued with its meaning unaltered.In fact, the discrimination which the hosiery interests desire will be
fully observed.Your suggestion as to an ad valorem duty of fifty per
cent on hose valued at less than sixty-five cents a dozen pairs is
exceptionally clever, in view of the fact that there are none of less
than that value.""Triumphant Republicanism," he commented."And
right in the face of the President's message.Wire Mall that I will be
in Washington Thursday evening to advise with him further about it.Hood, we've got a fight on in regard to
the President's idea of granting permission in private suits to use
judgments and facts brought out and entered in government suits
against combinations.And the
regulation of security issues of railroads--preposterous!If Mall and Gossitch and Wells don't oppose
that in the Senate, I'll see that they are up before the lunacy
commission--and I have some influence with that body!""There is nothing to fear, I think," replied Hood reassuringly."An
important piece of business legislation like that will hardly go
through this session.And then we will have time to prepare to
frustrate it.The suggestion to place the New York Stock Exchange
under government supervision is a much more serious matter, I think.""See here, Hood," said Ames, leaning forward and laying a hand upon
that gentleman's knee, "when that happens, we'll have either a
Socialist president or a Catholic in the White House, with Rome
twitching the string.Then I shall move to my Venezuelan estates, take
the vow of poverty, and turn monk.""Which reminds me again that by your continued relations with Rome you
are doing much to promote just that state of affairs," returned the
lawyer sententiously."But I find the Catholic Church
convenient--indeed, necessary--for the promotion of certain plans.But I shall
abruptly sever my relations with that institution some day--when I am
through with it.At present I am milking the Church to the extent of a
brimming pail every year; and as long as the udder is full and
accessible I shall continue to tap it.I tapped the Presbyterian
Church, through Borwell, last year, if you remember."Willett, chief secretary to Ames, entered at that moment with the
morning mail, opened and sorted, and replies written to letters of
such nature as he could attend to without suggestions from his chief."By the way," remarked Hood when he saw the letters, "I had word from
Collins this morning that he had secured a signed statement from that
fellow Marcus, who was crushed in the Avon mills yesterday.Marcus
accepted the medical services of our physicians, and died in our
hospital.Just before he went off, his wife accepted a settlement of
one hundred dollars.Looked big to her, I guess, and was a bird in the
hand."That reminds me," said Ames, looking up from his mail; "we are going
to close the mills earlier this year on account of the cotton
shortage.""Four thousand hands idle for three months, I suppose.we just escaped disaster last year, you remember.""It will be more than three months this time," commented Ames with a
knowing look.Then--"Hood, I verily believe you are a coward."Ames," replied the latter slowly, "I certainly would
hesitate to do some of the things you do.Yet you seem to get away
with them.""Perk up, Hood," laughed Ames."I've got real work for you as soon as
I get control of C. and R. I'm going to put you in as president, at a
salary of one hundred thousand per annum.Then you are going to buy
the road for me for about two million dollars, and I'll reorganize and
sell to the stockholders for five millions, still retaining control.The road is only a scrap heap, but its control is the first step
toward the amalgamation of the trolley interests of New England.Laws
are going to be violated, Hood, both in actual letter and in spirit.It's up to you to get around the
Interstate Commerce Commission in any way you can, and buttress this
little monopoly against competition and reform-infected legislatures."We'll send Crabbe to the Senate," Ames coolly replied."You seem to forget that senators are now elected by the people, Mr.The people are New York City, Buffalo, and
Albany.And Tammany at present is in my pocket.Buffalo and Albany can be swept by the Catholic vote.And I have that
in the upper right hand drawer of my private file.The 'people' will
therefore elect to the Senate the man I choose.In fact, I prefer
direct election of senators over the former method, for the people are
greater fools _en masse_ than any State Legislature that ever
assembled."He took up another letter from the pile on his desk and glanced
through it."Protests against the way
you nullified the Glaze-Bassett red-light injunction bill.I really didn't think it was in you."said Hood, puffing a little with
pride.But for that, the passage of the bill would have wiped out the
whole red-light district, and quartered the rents I now get from my
shacks down there.Now next year we will be better prepared to fight
the bill.The press will be with us then--a little cheaper and a
trifle more degraded than it is to-day."Ames read it and handed
it to his lawyer."The _Proteus_ has reached the African Gold Coast at
last," he said.Then he threw back his head and laughed heartily."Do
you know, Hood, the _Proteus_ carried two missionaries, sent to the
frizzle-topped Zulus by Borwell and his outfit.Deutsch and Company
cable that they have arrived.""But," said Hood in some perplexity, "the cargo of the _Proteus_ was
rum!""Just so," roared Ames; "that's where the joke comes in.I make it a
point that every ship of mine that carries a missionary to a foreign
field shall also carry a cargo of rum.The combination is one that the
Zulu finds simply irresistible!""So," commented Hood, "the Church goes down to Egypt for help!""I carry the missionaries free on my rum
boats.Great saving to the Board of Foreign Missions, you know."Hood looked at the man before him in undisguised admiration of his
cunning."And did you likewise send missionaries to China with your
opium cargoes?""I once sent Borwell himself to Hongkong on a boat
loaded to the rails with opium.We had insisted on his taking a needed
vacation, and so packed him off to Europe.In Bombay I cabled him to
take the _Crotus_ to Hongkong, transportation free.That was my last
consignment of opium to China, for restrictions had already fallen
upon our very Christian England, and the opium traffic was killed.I
had plans laid to corner the entire opium business in India, and I'd
have cleaned up a hundred million out of it, but for the pressure of
public sentiment.However, we're going to educate John Chinaman to
substitute whiskey for opium.But now," glancing at the great electric
wall clock, "I've wasted enough time with you.By the way, do you know
why this Government withheld recognition of the Chinese Republic?""No," replied Hood, standing in anticipation."Thirty thousand chests of opium," returned Ames laconically."Ames and Company had advanced to the English banks of Shanghai and
Hongkong half this amount, loaned on the opium.That necessitated a
few plain words from me to the President, and a quick trip from
Washington to London afterwards to interview his most Christian
British Majesty.A very pleasant and profitable trip, Hood, very!Hood threw his chief another look of intense admiration, and left the
room."Get Lafelle here some time to-day when I have a vacant hour,"
commanded Ames."Cable to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, of Cartagena, and
ask him if an American mining company is registered there under the
name of Simiti Development Company, and what properties they have and
where located.Tell him to cable reply, and follow with detailed
letter."He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes."The Congregation of
the Sacred Index has laid the ban on--what's the name of the book?"He
drew out a card-index drawer and selected a card, which he tossed to
the secretary.He seemed to
muse a while, then went on slowly."Carlos Madero, of Mexico, is in
New York.Learn where he is staying, and arrange an interview for me.Wire Senator Wells, Washington, that the bill for a Children's Bureau
must not be taken from the table.Wire the Sequana Coal
Company that I want their report to-morrow, without fail.Wire
Collins, at Avon, to tell the Spinners' Union I have nothing to
discuss with them.As Hood was chief of the Ames legal department, and Willett the chief
of his army of secretaries, so Hodson was the captain of his force of
brokers, a keen, sagacious trader, whose knowledge of the market and
whose ability in the matter of stock trading was almost uncanny."What's your selection for to-day, Hodson?"asked Ames, as the man
entered.Hodson laid on his desk three lists of suggested deals on the
exchanges of New York, London, and Paris.Ames glanced over them
hurriedly, drawing his pencil through certain that did not meet his
approval, and substituting others in which for particular reasons he
wished to trade that morning."What's your reason for thinking I ought
to buy Public Utilities?""They have the letting of the Hudson river tunnel contract," replied
Hodson.Ames studied the broker's face a moment.Then his own brightened, as
he began to divine the man's reason.he ejaculated, "you
think there's quicksand along the proposed route?""I know it," said Hodson calmly."Pick up ten thousand shares, if you can get them," returned Ames
quickly.Then--"I'm going to attend a meeting of the Council of
American Grain Exchanges at two to-day.I want you to be just outside
the door."Ames concluded, "I guess that's all.I'm at the bank at ten; at the Board of Trade at ten-thirty; Stock
Exchange at eleven; and lunch at Rector's at twelve sharp, returning
here immediately afterward."Hodson again bowed, and left the office to undertake his various
commissions.For the next half hour Ames pored over the morning's quota of letters
and messages, making frequent notes, and often turning to the
telephone at his hand.Then he summoned a stenographer and rapidly
dictated a number of replies."In my next vacant hour, following the one devoted to Lafelle, I want
to see Reverend Darius Borwell," he directed."Also," he continued,
"wire Strunz that I want a meeting of the Brewers' Union called at the
earliest possible date.By the way, ask Lafelle if he can spend the
night with me on board the _Cossack_, and if so, notify Captain
McCall.Here is a bundle of
requests for charity, for contributions to hospitals, orphan asylums,
and various homes.'Phone to the
City Assessor to come over whenever you can arrange an hour and go
over my schedule with me.By the way, tell Hood to take steps at once
to foreclose on the Bradley estate.Did you find out where Ketchim
does his banking?""Yes, sir," replied the secretary, "the Commercial State.""Very well, get the president, Mr.A few moments later Ames had purchased from the Commercial State bank
its note against the Ketchim Realty Company for ten thousand dollars."I thought Ketchim would be borrowing again," he chuckled, when he had
completed the transaction."His brains are composed of a disastrous
mixture of hypocrisy and greed.I've thrown another hook into him
now."At nine forty-five Ames left his private office and descended in his
elevator to the banking house on the second floor.He entered the
directors' room with a determined carriage, nodding pleasantly to his
associates.Taking his seat as chairman, he promptly called the
meeting to order.Some preliminary business occupied the first few minutes, and then
Ames announced:

"Gentlemen, when the State of New York offered the public sixty
millions of four per cent bonds last week, and I advised you to take
them at a premium of six per cent, you objected.I overruled you, and
the bank bought the bonds.Within forty-eight hours they were resold
at a premium of seven per cent, and the bank cleared six hundred
thousand.Now let me suggest that the
psychology of this transaction is worth your study.A commodity is a
drug on the market at one dollar, until somebody is willing to pay a
dollar and a half for it.Then a lot of people will want it, until
somebody else offers a bid of two.Then the price will soar, and the
number of those who covet the article and scramble for it will
increase proportionably.A murmur of admiration rose from the directors."I think," said one,
"that we had better send Mr.Ames to Washington to confer with the
President in regard to the proposed currency legislation.""That is already arranged," put in Ames."I meet the President next
Thursday for a conference on this matter.""Why, in that case," returned Ames with a knowing smile, "I think we
had better give him a little lesson to take out of office with
him--one that will ruin his second-term hopes--and then close our
bank."From the bank, the Board of Trade, the Stock Exchange, and his
luncheon with Senator Gossitch, Ames returned to his office for the
private interviews which his chief secretary had arranged.Then
followed further consultations with Hood over the daily, weekly, and
monthly reports which Ames required from all the various commercial,
financial, and mining enterprises in which he was interested; further
discussions of plans and schemes; further receipt and transmission of
cable, telegraphic, and telephone messages; and meetings with his
heads of departments, his captains, lieutenants, and minor officers,
to listen to their reports and suggestions, and to deliver his quick,
decisive commands, admonitions, and advice.From eight in the morning
until, as was his wont, Ames closed his desk and entered his private
elevator at five-thirty in the evening, his office flashed with the
superenergy of the man, with his intense activity, his decisive words,
and his stupendous endeavors, materialistic, absorptive, ruthless
endeavors.If one should ask what his day really amounted to, we can
but point to these incessant endeavors and their results in augmenting
his already vast material interests and his colossal fortune, a
fortune which Hood believed ran well over a hundred millions, and
which Ames himself knew multiplied that figure by five or ten.And the
fortune was increasing at a frightful pace, for he gave nothing, but
continually drew to himself, always and ever drawing, accumulating,
amassing, and absorbing, and for himself alone.Snapping his desk shut, he held a brief conversation over the wire
with the Beaubien, then descended to his waiting car and was driven
hastily to his yacht, the _Cossack_, where Monsignor Lafelle awaited
as his guest.It was one of the few pleasures which Ames allowed
himself during the warm months, to drop his multifarious interests and
spend the night aboard the _Cossack_, generally alone, rocking gently
on the restless billows, so typical of his own heaving spirit, as the
beautiful craft steamed noiselessly to and fro along the coast, well
beyond the roar of the huge _arena_ where human beings, formed of
dust, yet fatuously believing themselves made in the image of infinite
Spirit, strive and sweat, curse and slay, in the struggle to prove
their doubtful right to live.CHAPTER 13


The _Cossack_, with its great turbines purring like a sleeping kitten,
and its twin screws turning lazily, almost imperceptibly in the dark
waters, moved through the frosty night like a cloud brooding over the
deep.Yet it was a cloud of tremendous potentiality, enwrapping a
spirit of energy incarnate.From far aloft its burning eye pierced a
channel of light through the murky darkness ahead.In its wake it drew
a swell of sparkling phosphorescence, which it carelessly tossed off
on either side as a Calif might throw handfuls of glittering coins to
his fawning beggars.From somewhere in the structure above, the
crackling, hissing wireless mechanism was thrusting its invisible
hands out into the night and catching the fleeting messages that were
borne on the intangible pulsations of the mysterious ether.From time
to time these messages were given form and body, and despatched to the
luxurious suite below, where, in the dazzling sheen of silver and cut
glass, spread out over richest napery, and glowing beneath a torrent
of white light, sat the gigantic being whose will directed the
movements of this floating palace."You see, Lafelle, I look upon religion with the eye of the
cold-blooded business man, without the slightest trace of sentimentalism.From the business standpoint, the Protestant Church is a dead failure.It doesn't get results that are in any way commensurate with its
investment.But your Church is a success--from the point of dollars and
cents.In fact, in the matter of forming and maintaining a monopoly, I
take off my hat to the Vatican.Every day I learn something of value by studying your methods of
operating upon the public.And so you see why I take such pleasure in
talking with really astute churchmen like yourself."Monsignor Lafelle studied the man without replying, uncertain just
what interpretation to put upon the remark.The Japanese servant was
clearing away the remnants of the meal, having first lighted the
cigars of the master and guest."Now," continued Ames, leaning back in his luxurious chair and musing
over his cigar, "the purgatory idea is one of the cleverest schemes
ever foisted upon the unthinking masses, and it has proved a veritable
Klondike.if I could think up and put over a thing like that I'd
consider myself really possessed of brains."Ames," he replied adroitly, "you
do not know your Bible."I don't suppose I ever in my life read a whole
chapter in the book.I can't swallow such stuff, Lafelle--utterly
unreasonable, wholly inconsistent with facts and natural laws, as we
know and are able to observe them.Even as a child I never had any
use for fairy-tales, or wonder-stories.I always wanted facts,
tangible, concrete, irrefutable facts, not hypotheses.The Protestant
churches hand out a mess of incoherent guesswork, based on as many
interpretations of the Bible as there are human minds sufficiently
interested to interpret it, and then wax hot and angry when
hard-headed business men like myself refuse to subscribe to it.If they had anything tangible to
offer, it would be different.But I go to church for the looks of
the thing, and for business reasons; and then stick pins into myself
to keep awake while I listen to pedagogical Borwell tell what he
doesn't know about God and man.Then at the close of the service I
drop a five-dollar bill into the plate for the entertainment, and
go away with the feeling that I didn't get my money's worth.From a
business point of view, a Protestant church service is worth about
twenty-five cents for the music, and five cents for the privilege of
sleeping on a soft cushion.So you see I lose four dollars and
seventy cents every time I attend.You Catholic fellows, with your
ceremonial and legerdemain, give a much better entertainment.Besides, I like to hear your priests soak it to their cowering
flocks.""I shall have to class you with the incorrigibles," he
said with a rueful air."I am sorry you take such a harsh attitude
toward us.We are really more spiritual--"

Ames interrupted with a roar of laughter."Why, Lafelle, you old fraud, I look upon your
Church as a huge business institution, a gigantic trust, as mercenary
and merciless as Steel, Oil, or Tobacco!Why, you and I are in the
same business, that of making money!And I'd like to borrow some of
your methods.Only, you've got it over me, for you
hurl the weight of centuries of authority upon the poor, trembling
public; and I have to beat them down with clubs of my own making.Moreover, the law protects you in all your pious methods; while I have
to hire expensive legal talent to get around it.""You seem to be fairly successful, even at that," retorted Lafelle.Then, too politic to draw his host into an acrimonious argument that
might end in straining their now cordial and mutually helpful
friendship, he observed, looking at his cigar: "May I ask what you pay
for these?--for only an inexhaustible bank reserve can warrant their
like."He had struck the right chord, and Ames softened at once."These," he
said, tenderly regarding the thick, black weed in his fingers, "are
grown exclusively for me on my own plantation in Colombia.They cost
me about one dollar and sixty-eight cents each, laid down at my door
in New York.I searched the world over before I found the only spot
where such tobacco could be grown."continued Lafelle, lifting his glass of sparkling
champagne."On a little hillside, scarcely an acre in extent, in Granada, Spain,"
replied Ames."I have my own wine press and bottling plant there."Lafelle could not conceal his admiration for this man of luxury."And
does your exclusiveness extend also to your tea and coffee?""I grow tea for my table in both China and
Ceylon.And I have exclusive coffee plantations in Java and Brazil.But I'm now negotiating for one in Colombia, for I think that, without
doubt, the finest coffee in the world is grown there, although it
never gets beyond the coast line.""_Fortuna non deo_," murmured the churchman; "you man of chance and
destiny!""My friend," said he, "I have always insisted
that I possessed but a modicum of brains; but I am a gambler.With ordinary judgment and horse-sense, I take risks that
no so-called sane man would consider.The curse of the world is
fear--the chief instrument that you employ to hold the masses to your
churchly system.I know that as long as a
business opponent has fear to contend with, I am his master.Fear is
at the root of every ailment of mind, body, or environment.I repeat,
I know not the meaning of the word.Hence my position in the business
world.Hence, also, my freedom from the limitations of superstition,
religious or otherwise."Yes," replied Lafelle, drawing a long sigh, "in a sense I do.But you
greatly err, my friend, in deprecating your own powerful intellect.I
know of no brain but yours that could have put South Ohio Oil from one
hundred and fifty dollars up to over two thousand a share.I had a few
shares of that stock myself."Sorry I didn't know about it," he said.I didn't own a dollar's worth of South Ohio.Oh,
yes," he added, as he saw Lafelle's eyes widening in surprise, "I
pushed the market up until a certain lady, whom you and I both know,
thought it unwise to go further, and then I sprung the sudden
discovery of Colombian oil fields on them; and the market crashed
like a burst balloon.The lady cleared some two millions on the rig.No, I didn't have a drop of Colombian oil to grease the chute.It was
American nerve, that's all.""If you had lived in the Middle Ages you'd
have been burnt for possessing a devil!""On the contrary," quickly amended Ames, his eyes twinkling, "I'd have
been made a Cardinal."Both men laughed over the retort; and then Ames summoned the valet to
set in motion the great electrical pipe-organ, and to bring the
whiskey and soda.For the next hour the two men gave themselves up to the supreme luxury
of their magnificent environment, the stimulation of their beverage
and cigars, and the soothing effect of the soft music, combined with
the gentle movement of the boat.Then Ames took his guest into the
smoking room proper, and drew up chairs before a small table, on which
were various papers and writing materials."Now," he began, "referring to your telephone message of this morning,
what is it that you want me to do for you?Is it the old question of
establishing a nunciature at Washington?"Lafelle had been impatiently awaiting this moment.He therefore
plunged eagerly into his subject.Ames," said he, "I know you to
have great influence at the Capital.In the interests of humanity, I
ask you to use that influence to prevent the passage of the
immigration bill which provides for a literacy test."There was no need of this request; for, in the
interests, not of humanity, but of his own steamship companies, he
intended that there should be no restriction imposed upon immigration.But the Church was again playing into his hands, coming to him for
favors.And the Church always paid heavily for his support.he exclaimed with an assumption of interest, "so you ask me to
impugn my own patriotism!""I don't quite understand," he said."Why," Ames explained, "how long do you figure it will take, with
unrestricted immigration, for the Catholics to so outnumber the
Protestants in the United States as to establish their religion by law
and force it into the schools?""But your Constitution provides toleration for all
religions!""And the Constitution is quite flexible, and wholly subject to
amendment, is it not?"Lafelle flared out in unrestrained anger."What a bugaboo you
Protestants make of Roman Catholicism!"Why,
one would think that we Catholics were all anarchists!Are we such a
menace, such a curse to your Republican institutions?Do you ever stop
to realize what the Church has done for civilization, and for your
own country?And where, think you, would art and learning be now but
for her?Have you any adequate idea what the Church is doing
to-day for the poor, for the oppressed?You Protestants,
a thousand times more intolerant than we, treat us as if we were
Hindoo pariahs!This whole country is suffering from the delirium of
Roman Catholic-phobia!"There, my friend, calm yourself," soothed Ames, laying a hand on the
irate churchman's arm."And please do not class me with the
Protestants, for I am not one of them.You Catholic fellows have made
admirable gains in the past few years, and your steady encroachments
have netted you about ninety per cent of all the political offices in
and about Washington, so you have no complaint, even if the Church
isn't in politics.Meantime, his brain was working
rapidly."By the way, Lafelle," he said, abruptly resuming the
conversation, "you know all about church laws and customs, running way
back to mediaeval times.Can't you dig up some old provision whereby I
can block a fellow who claims to own a gold mine down in Colombia?If
you can, I'll see that the President vetoes every obnoxious
immigration bill that's introduced this term."Lafelle roused from his sulk and gulped down his wrath.Ames went on
to express his desire for vengeance upon one obscure Philip O. Ketchim,
broker, promoter, church elder, and Sunday school superintendent.Then at length Ames rose and rang for his valet."My God, Lafelle, the
idea's a corker!""From a book entitled 'Confessions of a Roman
Catholic Priest,' written anonymously, but, they say, by a young
attache of the Vatican who was insane at the time.However, he was apparently well informed on matters Colombian.""The law of _'en manos muertas'_," replied Lafelle."Well," exclaimed Ames, "again I take off my hat to your churchly
system!And now," he continued eagerly, "cable the Pope at once.I'll
have the operator send your code ashore by wireless, and the message
will go to Rome to-night.Tell the old man you've got influence at
work in Washington that is--well, more than strong, and that the
prospects for defeating the immigration bill are excellent."Lafelle arose and stood for a moment looking about the room."Before I
retire, my friend," he said, "I would like to express again the
admiration which the tasteful luxury of this smoking room has aroused
in me, and to ask, if I may, whether those stained-glass windows up
there are merely fanciful portraits?"Ames quickly glanced up at the faces of the beautiful women portrayed
in the rectangular glass windows which lined the room just below the
ceiling.They were exquisitely painted, in vivid colors, and so set as
to be illuminated during the day by sunlight, and at night by strong
electric lamps behind them."Because," returned Lafelle, "if I mistake not, I have seen a portrait
similar to that one," pointing up at one of the windows, where a sad,
wistful face of rare loveliness looked down upon them.In his complete absorption he had not noticed the
effect of his query upon Ames."I do not know," he replied slowly."London--Paris--Berlin--no, not there.And yet, it was in Europe, I am
sure."In the--Royal Gallery--at Madrid!""Yes," continued Lafelle confidently, still studying the portrait, "I
am certain of it.But," turning abruptly upon Ames, "you may have
known the original?""I assure you I never had that
pleasure," he said lightly."These art windows were set in by the
designer of the yacht.Adds much to the
general effect, don't you think?By the way, if a portrait similar to
that one hangs in the Royal Gallery at Madrid, you might try to learn
the identity of the original for me.It's quite interesting to feel
that one may have the picture of some bewitching member of royalty
hanging in his own apartments.By all means try to learn who the lady
is--unless you know."He stopped and searched the churchman's face.But--that picture
has haunted me from the day I first saw it in the Royal Gallery."Crafts, of 'Storrs and Crafts,'" replied Ames.Lafelle moved thoughtfully toward the door.The valet appeared at that
moment."Show Monsignor to his stateroom," commanded Ames."Good night,
Monsignor, good night.Remember, we dock at seven-thirty, sharp."Returning to the table, Ames sat down and rapidly composed a message
for his wireless operator to send across the dark waters to the city,
and thence to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, in Cartagena.This done, he
extinguished all the lights in the room excepting those which
illuminated the stained-glass windows above.Drawing his chair up in
front of the one which had stirred Lafelle's query, he sat before it
far into the morning, in absorbed contemplation, searching the sad
features of the beautiful face, pondering, revolving, sometimes
murmuring aloud, sometimes passing a hand across his brow, as if he
would erase from a relentless memory an impression made long since and
worn ever deeper by the recurrent thought of many years.CHAPTER 14


Almost within the brief period of a year, the barefoot, calico-clad
Carmen had been ejected from unknown Simiti and dropped into the midst
of the pyrotechnical society life of the great New World metropolis.Only an unusual interplay of mental forces could have brought about
such an odd result.But that it was a very logical outcome of the
reaction upon one another of human ambitions, fears, lust, and greed,
operating through the types of mind among which her life had been
cast, those who have followed our story thus far can have no doubt.The cusp of the upward-sweeping curve had been reached through the
insane eagerness of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to outdo her wealthy society
rivals in an arrogant display of dress, living, and vain, luxurious
entertaining, and the acquisition of the empty honor attaching to
social leadership.The coveted prize was now all but within the
shallow woman's grasp.she knew not that when her itching
fingers closed about it the golden bauble would crumble to ashes.The program as outlined by the Beaubien had been faithfully followed.Hawley-Crowles--whom, of course, she
had long desired to know more intimately--and an interchange of calls
had ensued, succeeded by a grand reception at the Ames mansion, the
first of the social season.Hawley-Crowles floated, as
upon a cloud, attired in a French gown which cost fifteen hundred
dollars, and shoes on her disproportioned feet for which she had
rejoiced to pay thirty dollars each, made as they had been from
specially selected imported leather, dyed to match her rich robe.It
was true, her pleasure had not been wholly unalloyed, for she had been
conscious of a trace of superciliousness on the part of some of the
gorgeous birds of paradise, twittering and hopping in their hampering
skirts about the Ames parlors, and pecking, with milk-fed content, at
the rare cakes and ices.But she only held her empty head the higher,
and fluttered about the more ostentatiously and clumsily, while
anticipating the effect which her charming and talented ward would
produce when she should make her bow to these same vain, haughty
devotees of the cult of gold.And she had wisely planned that Carmen's
_debut_ should follow that of Kathleen Ames, that it might eclipse her
rival's in its wanton display of magnificence.On the heels of the Ames reception surged the full flood of the
winter's social orgy.Early in November Kathleen Ames was duly
presented.The occasion was made one of such stupendous display that
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles first gasped, then shivered with apprehension,
lest she be unable to outdo it.She went home from it in a somewhat
chastened frame of mind, and sat down at her _escritoire_ to make
calculations.Could she on her meager annual income of one hundred and
fifty thousand hope to meet the Ames millions?She had already allowed
that her wardrobe would cost not less than twenty-five thousand
dollars a year, to say nothing of the additional expense of properly
dressing Carmen.But she now saw that this amount was hopelessly
inadequate.She therefore increased the figure to seventy-five
thousand.Could she maintain her
city home, entertain in the style now demanded by her social position,
and spend her summers at Newport, as she had planned?No, her income would not suffice; she would be obliged to
draw on the principal until Carmen could be married off to some
millionaire, or until her own father died.if he would only
terminate his useless existence soon!But, in lieu of that delayed desideratum, some expedient must be
devised at once.That obscure, retiring
woman was annually making her millions.A tip now and then from her, a
word of advice regarding the market, and her own limited income would
expand accordingly.She had not seen the Beaubien since becoming a
member of Holy Saints.But on that day, and again, two months later,
when the splendid altar to the late lamented and patriotic citizen,
the Honorable James Hawley-Crowles, was dedicated, she had marked the
woman, heavily veiled, sitting alone in the rear of the great church.She had shuddered as she
thought the tall, black-robed figure typified an ominous shadow
falling athwart her own foolish existence.But there was no doubt of Carmen's hold on the strange, tarnished
woman.And so, smothering her doubts and pocketing her pride, she
again sought the Beaubien, ostensibly in regard to Carmen's
forthcoming _debut_; and then, very adroitly and off-handedly, she
brought up the subject of investments, alleging that the added burden
of the young girl now rendered it necessary to increase the rate of
interest which her securities were yielding.The Beaubien proved herself the soul of candor and generosity.Not
only did she point out to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles how her modest income
might be quadrupled, but she even offered, in such a way as to make it
utterly impossible for that lady to take offense, to lend her whatever
amount she might need, at any time, to further Carmen's social
conquest.And during the conversation she announced that she herself
was acting on a suggestion dropped by the great financier, Ames, and
was buying certain stocks now being offered by a coming power in world
finance, Mr.Hawley-Crowles had heard of this man!Was he not
promoting a company in which her sister's husband, and the girl
herself, were interested?And if such investments were good enough for
a magnate of Ames's standing, they certainly were good enough for her.Indeed, why had she not thought of
this before!She would get Carmen to hypothecate her own interest in
this new company, if necessary.That interest of itself was worth a
fortune.Hawley-Crowles and Carmen so desired, the
Beaubien would advance them whatever they might need on that
security alone.Or, she would take the personal notes of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles--"For, you know, my dear," she said sweetly, "when
your father passes away you are going to be very well off, indeed, and
I can afford to discount that inevitable event somewhat, can I
not?"Hawley-Crowles soared into the empyrean, and this
self-absorbed woman, who never in her life had earned the equivalent
of a single day's food, launched the sweet, white-souled girl of
the tropics upon the oozy waters of New York society with such
_eclat_ that the Sunday newspapers devoted a whole page, profusely
illustrated, to the gorgeous event and dilated with much extravagance
of expression upon the charms of the little Inca princess, and
upon the very important and gratifying fact that the three hundred
fashionable guests present displayed jewels to the value of not less
than ten million dollars.The function took the form of a musicale, in which Carmen's rich
voice was first made known to the _beau monde_.The girl instantly
swept her auditors from their feet.The splendid pipe-organ, which
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles had hurriedly installed for the occasion,
became a thing inspired under her deft touch.It seemed in that
garish display of worldliness to voice her soul's purity, its
wonder, its astonishment, its lament over the vacuities of this
highest type of human society, its ominous threats of thundered
denunciation on the day when her tongue should be loosed and the
present mesmeric spell broken--for she was under a spell, even
that of this new world of tinsel and material veneer.Gannette wept on Carmen's shoulder, and went
home vowing that she would be a better woman and cut out her night-cap
of Scotch-and-soda.Others crowded about the girl and showered their
fulsome praise upon her.Ames and her daughter
Kathleen.They stared at the lovely _debutante_ with wonder and
chagrin written legibly upon their bepowdered visages.And before the
close of the function Kathleen had become so angrily jealous that she
was grossly rude to Carmen when she bade her good night.For her own
feeble light had been drowned in the powerful radiance of the girl
from Simiti.And from that moment the assassination of the character
of the little Inca princess was decreed.But, what with incessant striving to adapt herself to her environment,
that she might search its farthest nook and angle; what with ceaseless
efforts to check her almost momentary impulse to cry out against the
vulgar display of modernity and the vicious inequity of privilege
which she saw on every hand; what with her purity of thought; her rare
ideals and selfless motives; her boundless love for humanity; and her
passionate desire to so live her "message" that all the world might
see and light their lamps at the torch of her burning love for God and
her fellow-men, Carmen found her days a paradox, in that they were
literally full of emptiness.After her _debut_, event followed event
in the social life of the now thoroughly gay metropolis, and the poor
child found herself hustled home from one function, only to change her
attire and hurry again, weary of spirit, into the waiting car, to be
whisked off to another equally vapid.It seemed to the bewildered girl
that she would never learn what was _de rigueur_; what conventions
must be observed at one social event, but amended at another.Her
tight gowns and limb-hampering skirts typified the soul-limitation of
her tinsel, environment; her high-heeled shoes were exquisite torture;
and her corsets, which her French maid drew until the poor girl gasped
for air, seemed to her the cruellest device ever fashioned by the
vacuous, enslaved human mind.Frequently she changed her clothing
completely three and four times a day to meet her social demands.Night became day; and she had to learn to sleep until noon.She found
no time for study; none even for reading.And conversation, such as
was indulged under the Hawley-Crowles roof, was confined to insipid
society happenings, with frequent sprinklings of racy items anent
divorce, scandal, murder, or the debauch of manhood.From this she
drew more and more aloof and became daily quieter.It was seldom, too, that she could escape from the jaded circle of
society revelers long enough to spend a quiet hour with the Beaubien.But when she could, she would open the reservoirs of her soul and give
full vent to her pent-up emotions."Oh," she would often exclaim, as
she sat at the feet of the Beaubien in the quiet of the darkened music
room, and gazed into the crackling fire, "how can they--how can
they!"Then the Beaubien would pat her soft, glowing cheek and murmur, "Wait,
dearie, wait."And the tired girl would sigh and close her eyes and
dream of the quiet of little Simiti and of the dear ones there from
whom she now heard no word, and yet whom she might not seek, because
of the war which raged about her lowly birthplace.The gay season was hardly a month advanced when Mrs.Ames angrily
admitted to herself that her own crown was in gravest danger.The
South American girl--and because of her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her
blase sister--had completely captured New York's conspicuous circle.Hawley-Crowles apparently did not lack for funds, but entertained
with a display of reckless disregard for expense, and a carelessness
of critical comment, that stirred the city to its depths and aroused
expressions of wonder and admiration on every hand.The newspapers
were full of her and her charming ward.Surely, if the girl's social
prestige continued to soar, the Ames family soon would be relegated to
the social "has-beens."Ames and her haughty daughter held
many a serious conference over their dubious prospects.Night after night, when the Beaubien's dinner
guests had dispersed, he would linger to discuss the social war now in
full progress, and to exchange with her witty comments on the
successes of the combatants.One night he announced, "Lafelle is in
England; and when he returns he is coming by way of the West Indies.I
shall cable him to stop for a week at Cartagena, to see Wenceslas on a
little matter of business for me."Hawley-Crowles has become
nicely enmeshed in his net," she returned."The altar to friend Jim is
a beauty.Also, I hear that she is going to finance Ketchim's mining
company in Colombia.""I learned to-day that Ketchim's engineer, Harris,
has returned to the States.Couldn't get up the Magdalena river, on
account of the fighting.There will be nothing doing there for a year
yet.""Just as well," commented the Beaubien.Then abruptly--"By the way, I
now hold Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's notes to the amount of two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars.I want you to buy them from me and be ready to
turn the screws when I tell you."he exclaimed, pinching her
cheek.I'll take them off your hands to-morrow.And by the
way, I must meet this Carmen.""You let her alone," said the Beaubien quickly in a low voice.*       *       *       *       *

The inauguration of the Grand Opera season opened to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
another avenue for her astonishing social activities.With rare
shrewdness she had contrived to outwit Mrs.Ames and secure the center
box in the "golden horseshoe" at the Metropolitan.There, like a gaudy
garden spider in its glittering web, she sat on the opening night,
with her rapt _protegee_ at her side, and sent her insolent challenge
broadcast.Multimillionaires and their haughty, full-toileted dames were
ranged on either side of her, brewers and packers, distillers and
patent medicine concoctors, railroad magnates and Board of Trade
plungers, some under indictment, others under the shadow of death,
all under the mesmeric charm of gold.In the box at her left sat the
Ames family, with their newly arrived guests, the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her son.Ames was smiling
and affable when she exchanged calls with the gorgeous occupants of
the Hawley-Crowles box."So chawmed to meet you," murmured the heir of Altern, a callow youth
of twenty-three, bowing over the dainty, gloved hand of Carmen.Then,
as he adjusted his monocle and fixed his jaded eyes upon the fresh
young girl, "Bah Jove!"The gigantic form of Ames wedged in between the young man and Carmen."I've heard a lot about you," he said genially, in a heavy voice that
harmonized well with his huge frame; "but we haven't had an
opportunity to get acquainted until to-night."For some moments he stood holding her hand and looking steadily at
her.The girl gazed up at him with her trustful brown eyes alight, and
a smile playing about her mouth.While she chatted brightly Ames held her hand and laughed at her
frank, often witty, remarks.But then a curious, eager look came into
his face, and he became quiet and reflective.He seemed unable to take
his eyes from her.And when the girl gently drew her hand from his he
laughed again, nervously."I--I know something about Colombia," he said, "and speak the language
a bit.We'll have to get together often, so's I can brush up."Hawley-Crowles and her sister for the
first time--"Oh, so glad to see you both!Camorso's in fine voice
to-night, eh?"He wheeled about and stood again looking at Carmen, until she blushed
under his close gaze and turned her head away.But throughout the evening, whenever the girl looked in the
direction of the Ames family, she met the steady, piercing gaze of the
man's keen gray eyes.And they seemed to her like sharp steel points,
cutting into the portals of her soul.Night after night during the long season Carmen sat in the box and
studied the operas that were produced on the boards before her
wondering gaze.Hawley-Crowles was with her.And
generally, too, the young heir of Altern was there, occupying the
chair next to the girl--which was quite as the solicitous Mrs."Aw--deucedly fine show to-night, Miss Carmen," the youth ventured one
evening, as he took his accustomed place close to her."The music is always beautiful," the girl responded."But the play,
like most of Grand Opera, is drawn from the darkest side of human
life.It is a sordid picture of licentiousness and cruelty.Only for
its setting in wonderful music, Grand Opera is generally such a
depiction of sex-passion, of lust and murder, that it would not be
permitted on the stage.A few years from now people will be horrified
to remember that the preceding generation reveled in such blood
scenes--just as we now speak with horror of the gladiatorial contests
in ancient Rome.""But--aw--Miss Carmen," he
hazarded, "we must be true to life, you know!"Having delivered
himself of this oracular statement, the youth adjusted his monocle and
settled back as if he had given finality to a weighty argument."You voice the cant of the modern
writer, 'true lo life.'True to the horrible, human sense of life,
that looks no higher than the lust of blood, and is satisfied with it,
I admit.True to the unreal, temporal sense of existence, that is here
to-day, and to-morrow has gone out in the agony of self-imposed
suffering and death.True to that awful, false sense of life which we
must put off if we would ever rise into the consciousness of _real_
life, I grant you.But the production of these horrors on the stage,
even in a framework of marvelous music, serves only to hold before us
the awful models from which we must turn if we would hew out a better
existence.Are you the better for seeing an exhibition of wanton
murder on the stage, even though the participants wondrously sing
their words of vengeance and passion?""But--aw--they serve as warnings; they show us the things we ought not
to do, don't you know.""The sculptor who would chisel a beautiful form, does he
set before him the misshapen body of a hunchback, in order that he may
see what not to carve?""And we who would transform the
human sense of life into one of freedom from evil, can we build a
perfect structure with such grewsome models as this before us?You
don't see it now," she sighed; "you are in the world, and of it; and
the world is deeply under the mesmeric belief of evil as a stern
reality.But the day is coming when our musicians and authors will
turn from such base material as this to nobler themes--themes which
will excite our wonder and admiration, and stimulate the desire for
purity of thought and deed--themes that will be beacon lights, and
true guides.Hawley-Crowles frowned heavily as she listened to this
conversation, and she drew a sigh of relief when Carmen, sensing the
futility of any attempt to impress her thought upon the young man,
turned to topics which he could discuss with some degree of
intelligence.Late in the evening Ames dropped in and came directly to the
Hawley-Crowles box.He brought a huge box of imported candy and a
gorgeous bouquet of orchids, which he presented to Carmen.Hawley-Crowles beamed upon him like the effulgent midday sun."Kathleen wants you, Reggy," Ames abruptly announced to the young man,
whose lips were molding into a pout.His huge bulk loomed over the younger man like a
mountain as he took him by the shoulders and turned him toward the
exit.protested the youth, with a vain show
of resistance.Ames said nothing; but his domineering personality forced the boy out
of the box and into the corridor.Then he took the seat which his evicted nephew
had vacated, and bent over Carmen.With a final hopeless survey of the
situation, Reginald turned and descended to the cloak room, muttering
dire but futile threats against his irresistible relative.Ames's manner unconsciously assumed an air of
patronage."This is the first real opportunity I've had to talk with
you.Tell me, what do you think of New York?""Well," she began uncertainly, "since I have
thawed out, or perhaps have become more accustomed to the cold, I have
begun to make mental notes.But they
are not yet classified, and so I can hardly answer your question, Mr.But I am sure of one thing, and that is that for the first few
months I was here I was too cold to even think!""Yes," he agreed, "the change from the tropics was
somewhat abrupt."It is like awaking from a deep sleep," answered Carmen meditatively."In Simiti we dream our lives away.In New York all is action; loud
words; harsh commands; hurry; rush; endeavor, terrible, materialistic
endeavor!Every person I see seems to be going somewhere.He may not
know where he is going--but he is on the way.He may not know why he
is going--but he must not be stopped.He has so few years to live; and
he must pile up money before he goes.He must own an automobile; he
must do certain things which his more fortunate neighbor does, before
his little flame of life goes out and darkness falls upon him.I
sometimes think that people here are trying to get away from
themselves, but they don't know it.I think they come to the opera
because they crave any sort of diversion that will make them forget
themselves for a few moments, don't you?"well, I can't say," was Ames's meaningless reply, as he sat
regarding the girl curiously."And," she continued, as if pleased to have an auditor who at least
pretended to understand her, "the thing that now strikes me most
forcibly is the great confusion that prevails here in everything, in
your government, in your laws, in your business, in your society, and,
in particular, in your religion.Why, in that you have hundreds of
sects claiming a monopoly of truth; you have hundreds of churches,
hundreds of religious or theological beliefs, hundreds of differing
concepts of God--but you get nowhere!Why, it has come to such a pass
that, if Jesus were to appear physically on earth to-day, I am sure he
would be evicted from his own Church!""Well, yes, I guess that's so," commented Ames, quite at sea in such
conversation."But we solid business men have found that religious
emotion never gets a man anywhere.Makes a man
effeminate, and utterly unfits him for business.I wouldn't have a man
in my employ who was a religious enthusiast.""But Jesus was a religious enthusiast," she protested."I doubt if there ever was such a person," he answered dryly."Why, the Bible--"

"Is the most unfortunate and most misunderstood piece of literature
ever written," he interrupted."And the Church, well, I regard it as
the greatest fraud ever perpetrated upon the human race.""You mean that to apply to every church?"But their thoughts were running in widely divergent
channels.The conversational topic of the moment had no interest
whatsoever for the man.But this brilliant, sparkling girl--there was
something in those dark eyes, that soft voice, that brown hair--by
what anomaly did this beautiful creature come out of desolate,
mediaeval Simiti?Ames, you do not know what religion is.""It is that which binds us to God."No, he knew not the meaning of the word.His thought
broke restraint and flew wildly back--but he caught it, and rudely
forced it into its wonted channel.But, did he love his fellow-men?What would that profit him in dollars and cents?The thought brought a cynical laugh to
his lips.Carmen looked up at him wonderingly."You will have to, you
know," she said quixotically.Then she reached out a hand and laid it on his.He looked down at it,
so soft, so white, so small, and he contrasted it with the huge, hairy
bulk of his own.He felt it, felt
himself yielding.He was beginning to look beyond the beautiful
features, the rare grace and charm of physical personality, which had
at first attracted only the baser qualities of his nature, and was
seeing glimpses of a spiritual something which lay back of all
that--infinitely more beautiful, unspeakably richer, divine, sacred,
untouchable."Of course you will attend the Charity Ball, Mr.Hawley-Crowles jarred upon his ear like a shrill discord."But I shall be represented by my family.Hawley-Crowles, taking the query to
herself."That is, if my French dressmaker does not fail me.She
arched her brows at him as she propounded this innocent question."I'll tell you what it is this year," he sagely
replied.He gave a sententious nod of
his head."I overheard Kathleen and her mother discussing plans.And--do you want to know next season's innovation?He stopped and laughed heartily at his own treasonable
deceit.Hawley-Crowles eagerly, as she drew her
chair closer."One condition," replied Ames, holding up a thick finger."Well, I want to get better acquainted with your charming ward," he
whispered."Of course; and I want you to know her better." wigs," said Ames, with a knowing look.Hawley-Crowles settled back with a smile of supreme satisfaction.She would boldly anticipate next season at the coming Charity Ball.Then, leaning over toward Ames, she laid her fan upon his arm."Can't
you manage to come and see us some time, my sister and Carmen?"Just call me up a little in advance."The blare of trumpets and the crash of drums drew their attention
again to the stage.A business
associate in a distant box had beckoned him.Hawley-Crowles
dismissed him reluctantly; then turned her wandering attention to the
play.But Carmen sat shrouded in thoughts that were not stimulated by the
puppet-show before her.The tenor shrieked out his tender passion, and
the tubby soprano sank into his inadequate arms with languishing
sighs.Carmen heeded not their stage amours.She saw in the glare
before her the care-lined face of the priest of Simiti; she saw the
grim features and set jaw of her beloved, black-faced Rosendo, as he
led her through the dripping jungle; she saw Anita's blind, helpless
babe; she saw the little newsboy of Cartagena; and her heart welled
with a great love for them all; and she buried her face in her hands
and wept softly.CHAPTER 15

"Wait, my little princess, wait," the Beaubien had said, when Carmen,
her eyes flowing and her lips quivering, had again thrown herself into
that strange woman's arms and poured out her heart's surcease."I want to go back to Simiti, to Padre Jose, to my home," wailed the
girl."I don't understand the ways and the thoughts of these people.They don't know God--they don't know what love is--they don't know
anything but money, and clothes, and sin, and death.When I am with
them I gasp, I choke--"

"Yes, dearest, I understand," murmured the woman softly, as she
stroked the brown head nestling upon her shoulder.And many even of the 'four hundred' are suffering from the
same disease; but they would die rather than admit it.To no one could the attraction which had drawn Carmen and the Beaubien
together seem stranger, more inexplicable, than to that lone woman
herself.And both acknowledged it, nor
would have had it otherwise.To Carmen, the Beaubien was a sympathetic
confidante and a wise counselor.The girl knew nothing of the woman's
past or present life.She tried to see in her only the reality which
she sought in every individual--the reality which she felt that Jesus
must have seen clearly back of every frail mortal concept of humanity.And in doing this, who knows?--she may have transformed the sordid,
soiled woman of the world into something more than a broken semblance
of the image of God.To the Beaubien, this rare child, the symbol of
love, of purity, had become a divine talisman, touching a dead soul
into a sense of life before unknown.If Carmen leaned upon her, she,
on the other hand, bent daily closer to the beautiful girl; opened her
slowly warming heart daily wider to her; twined her lonely arms daily
closer about the radiant creature who had come so unexpectedly into
her empty, sinful life."But, mother dear"--the Beaubien had long since begged Carmen always
to address her thus when they were sharing alone these hours of
confidence--"they will not listen to my message!They laugh and jest
about real things!"And yet you tell me that the Bible says wise men
laughed at the great teacher, Jesus."And his message--oh, mother dearest, his message would have
helped them so, if they had only accepted it!It would have changed
their lives, healed their diseases, and saved them from death.And my
message"--her lip quivered--"my message is only his--it is the message
of love.But--I am so out of place among them.Their talk is so coarse, so
low and degraded.They don't
know what miserable failures they all are.Hawley-Crowles--"

The Beaubien's jaw set.--she will not let me speak of God in her house.She told me to keep
my views to myself and never voice them to her friends.And she says I
must marry either a millionaire or a foreign noble."And become a snobbish expatriate!Marry a decadent count, and
then shake the dust of this democratic country from your feet forever!Go to London or Paris or Vienna, and wear tiaras and coronets, and
speak of disgraceful, boorish America in hushed whispers!She forgets that the tarnished name she bears was
dragged up out of the ruck of the impecunious by me when I received
Jim Crowles into my house!And that I gave him what little gloss he
was able to take on!""Mother dear--I would leave them--only, they need love, oh, so much!"The Beaubien strained her to her bosom."They need you, dearie; they
little realize how they need you!I, myself, did not know until you
came to me.There, I didn't mean to let those tears get away from
me."She laughed softly as Carmen looked up anxiously into her face."Now come," she went on brightly, "we must plan for the Charity
Ball."A look of pain swept over the girl's face.The Beaubien bent and
kissed her."You will not leave society
voluntarily.They
will light their own lamps at yours--or they will thrust you from
their doors.And then," she muttered, as her teeth snapped together,
"you will come to me."Close on the heels of the opera season followed the Charity Ball, the
Horse Show, and the Fashion Show in rapid succession, with numberless
receptions, formal parties, and nondescript social junketings
interspersed.During these fleeting hours of splash and glitter Mrs.Hawley-Crowles trod the air with the sang-froid and exhilaration of an
expert aviator.Backed by the Beaubien millions, and with the
wonderful South American girl always at her right hand, the
worldly ambitious woman swept everything before her, cut a social
swath far wider than the glowering Mrs.Ames had ever attempted, and
marched straight to the goal of social leadership, almost without
interference.She had apparently achieved other successes, too, of
the first importance.She had secured the assistance of Ames himself
in matters pertaining to her finances; and the Beaubien was
actively cooeperating with her in the social advancement of Carmen.It is true, she gasped whenever her thought wandered to her notes
which the Beaubien held, notes which demanded every penny of her
principal as collateral.And she often meditated very soberly over
the large sums which she had put into the purchase of Simiti stock,
at the whispered suggestions of Ames, and under the irresistibly
pious and persuasive eloquence of Philip O. Ketchim, now president
of that flourishing but as yet non-productive company.But then, one
day, an idea occurred to her, and she forthwith summoned Carmen into
the library."You see, my dear," she said, after expounding to the girl certain of
her thoughts anent the famous mine, "I do not want Mr.Ketchim to have
any claim upon you for the expense which he incurred on account of
your six months in the Elwin school.That thought, as well as others
relating to your complete protection, makes it seem advisable that you
transfer to me your share in the mine, or in the Simiti company.See,
I give you a receipt for the same, showing that you have done this as
part payment for the great expense to which I have been put in
introducing you to society and in providing for your wants here.It is
merely formal, of course.And it keeps your share still in our
family, of which you are and always will be a member; but yet removes
all liability from you.Of course, you know nothing about business
matters, and so you must trust me implicitly.Which I am sure you do,
in view of what I have done for you, don't you, dear?"Of course Carmen did; and of course she unhesitatingly transferred her
claim on La Libertad to the worthy Mrs.Whereupon the
good woman tenderly kissed the innocent child, and clasped a string of
rich pearls about the slender, white neck.And Carmen later told the
Beaubien, who said nothing, but frowned darkly as she repeated the
tidings over her private wire to J. Wilton Ames.But that priest of
finance only chuckled and exclaimed: "Excellent, my dear!By the way, I had a cable from Lafelle this morning, from
Cartagena.But the
Beaubien hung up the receiver with a presentiment that everything was
far from right, despite his bland assurance.And she regretted
bitterly now that she had not warned Carmen against this very thing.The Charity Ball that season was doubtless the most brilliant function
of its kind ever held among a people who deny the impossible.The
newspapers had long vied with one another in their advertisements and
predictions; they afterward strove mightily to outdo themselves in
their vivid descriptions of the gorgeous _fete_.The decorative
effects far excelled anything ever attempted in the name of
"practical" charity.The display of gowns had never before been even
closely approximated.The scintillations from jewels whose value
mounted into millions was like the continuous flash of the electric
spark.And the huge assemblage embraced the very cream of the
nobility, the aristocracy, the rich and exclusive caste of a great
people whose Constitution is founded on the equality of men, and who
are wont to gather thus annually for a few hours to parade their
material vestments and divert their dispirited mentalities under the
guise of benefaction to a class for whom they rarely hold a loving
thought.Hawley-Crowles had planned and executed a _coup_.Ames had subscribed the munificent sum of twenty-five thousand
dollars to charity a week before the ball.Hawley-Crowles had
waited for this.Then she gloated as she telephoned to the various
newspaper offices that her subscription would be fifty thousand.Did
she give a new note to the Beaubien for this amount?That she
did--and she obtained the money on the condition that the little Inca
princess should lead the grand march.Hawley-Crowles
knew that she must gracefully yield first place to the South American
girl; and yet she contrived to score a triumph in apparent defeat.Ames and her daughter Kathleen at the
last moment refused to attend the function, alleging fatigue from a
season unusually exacting.Hawley-Crowles had
previously secured the languid young Duke of Altern as a partner for
Carmen--and then was most agreeably thwarted by Ames himself, who,
learning that his wife and daughter would not attend, abruptly
announced that he himself would lead the march with Carmen.Was it not quite proper that the city's leading man of
finance should, in the absence of his wife and daughter, and with
their full and gratuitous permission--nay, at their urgent request, so
it was told--lead with this fair young damsel, this tropical flower,
who, as rumor had it, was doubtless a descendant of the royal dwellers
in ancient Cuzco?"Quite proper, _O tempora, O mores_!"murmured one Amos A. Hitt,
erstwhile Presbyterian divine, explorer, and gentleman of leisure, as
he settled back in his armchair in the fashionable Weltmore apartments
and exhaled a long stream of tobacco smoke through his wide nostrils."And, if I can procure a ticket, I shall give myself the pleasure of
witnessing this sacred spectacle, produced under the deceptive mask of
charity," he added.In vain the Beaubien labored with Ames when she learned of his
intention--though she said nothing to Carmen.Ames had yielded to her
previously expressed wish that he refrain from calling at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion, or attempting to force his attentions upon the
young girl.But in this matter he remained characteristically
obdurate.For the angry
Beaubien, striving to shield the innocent girl, had vented her
abundant wrath upon the affable Ames, and had concluded her
denunciation with a hint of possible exposure of certain dark facts of
which she was sole custodian.Ames smiled, bowed, and courteously
kissed her hand, as he left her stormy presence; but he did not yield.Through the perfumed air and the garish light tore the crashing notes
of the great band.The loud hum of voices ceased, and all eyes turned
to the leaders of the grand march, as they stepped forth at one end of
the great auditorium.Then an involuntary murmur arose from the
multitude--a murmur of admiration, of astonishment, of envy.The
gigantic form of Ames stood like a towering pillar, the embodiment of
potential force, the epitome of human power, physical and mental.His
massive shoulders were thrown back as if in haughty defiance of
comment, critical or commendatory.The smile which flitted about his
strong, clean-shaven face bespoke the same caution as the gentle
uplifting of a tiger's paw--behind it lay all that was humanly
terrible, cunning, heartless, and yet, in a sense, fascinating.His
thick, brown hair, scarcely touched with gray, lay about his great
head like a lion's mane.He raised a hand and gently pushed it back
over the lofty brow.Then he bent and offered an arm to the slender
wisp of a girl at his side.murmured a tall, angular man in the crowd."I don't know, Hitt," replied the friend addressed."But they say she
belongs to the Inca race."The graceful girl moving by the side of her giant escort seemed like a
slender ray of light, a radiant, elfish form, transparent, intangible,
gliding softly along with a huge, black shadow.She was simply clad,
all in white.About her neck hung a string of pearls, and at her waist
she wore the rare orchids which Ames had sent her that afternoon.No one marked the pure simplicity of her attire.The absence of sparkling jewels and resplendent raiment evoked no
comment.The multitude saw but her wonderful face; her big eyes,
uplifted in trustful innocence to the massive form at her side; her
rich brown hair, which glittered like string-gold in the strong light
that fell in torrents upon it.There's a nimbus about her head!""I could almost believe it," whispered that gentleman, straining his
long neck as she passed before him.Immediately behind Carmen and Ames strode the enraptured Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who saw not, neither heard, and who longed for no
further taste of heaven than this stupendous triumph which she had won
for herself and the girl.Her heavy, unshapely form was squeezed into
a marvelous costume of gold brocade.A double ballet ruffle of stiff
white tulle encircled it about the hips as a drapery.The bodice was
of heavy gold net.A pleated band of pale moire, in a delicate shade
of pink, crossed the left shoulder and was caught at the waist in a
large rose bow, ambassadorial style.A double necklace of diamonds,
one bearing a great pendant of emeralds, and the other an alternation
of emeralds and diamonds, encircled her short, thick neck.A diamond
coronet fitted well around her wonderful amber- wig--for, true
to her determination, she had anticipated the now _passee_ Mrs.Ames
and had boldly launched the innovation of  wigs among the smart
set.An ivory, hand-painted fan, of great value, dangled from her
thick wrist.And, as she lifted her skirts to an unnecessary height,
the gaping people caught the glitter of a row of diamonds in each
high, gilded heel.At her side the young Duke of Altern shuffled, his long, thin body
curved like a kangaroo, and his monocle bent superciliously upon the
mass of common clay about him."Aw, beastly crush, ye know," he
murmured from time to time to the unhearing dame at his right.And
then, as she replied not, he fell to wondering if she fully realized
who he was.Around and across the great hall the gorgeous pageant swept.The
big-mouthed horns bellowed forth their noisy harmony.In the distant
corridors great illuminated fountains softly plashed.At the tables
beyond, sedulous, touting waiters were hurriedly extracting corks from
frosted bottle necks.The rare porcelain and cut glass shone and
glittered in rainbow tints.The revelers waxed increasingly merry and
care-free as they lightly discussed poverty over rich viands and
sparkling Burgundy.Still further beyond, the massive oak doors, with
their leaded-glass panes, shut out the dark night and the bitter
blasts of winter.And they shut out, too, another, but none the less
unreal, externalization of the mortal thought which has found
expression in a social system "too wicked for a smile.""God, no--I'd get arrested!The frail, hungry woman who stood before the great doors clutched her
wretched shawl closer about her thin shoulders.Her teeth chattered as
she stood shivering in the chill wind.At the corner of the building the cold blast almost swept her off her
feet.A man, dirty and unkempt, who had been waiting in an alley, ran
out and seized her."I say, Jude, ain't ye goin' in?Git arrested--ye'd spend the night in
a warm cell, an' that's better'n our bunk, ain't it?""I'm goin' to French Lucy's," the woman whispered hoarsely.Ye've lost yer looks, Jude, an' ol' Lucy ain't a-goin' to take
ye in.We gotta snipe somepin quick--or starve!Look, we'll go down to
Mike's place, an' then come back here when it's out, and ye kin pinch
a string, or somepin, eh?For a moment she stood listening
to the music from within.A sob shook her, and she began to cough
violently.The man took her arm, not unkindly; and together they moved
away into the night.*       *       *       *       *

"Well, little girl, at last we are alone.He had, late in the evening,
secured seats well hidden behind a mass of palms, and thither had led
Carmen.Ever see
anything like this in Simiti?"She was
glad to get away for a moment from the crowd, from the confusion, and
from the unwelcome attentions of the now thoroughly smitten young Duke
of Altern."No," she finally made answer, "I didn't know there were such things
in the world."A new toy--one that would last a long time."Yes," he went on genially, "I'll wager there's millions of dollars'
worth of jewelry here to-night.""And are the people going to sell it and give the
money to the poor?""But--this is a--a charity--"

"Oh, I see.No, it's the money derived from the sale of
tickets that goes to the poor.""But--aren't you interested in the poor?""Of course, of course," he hastened to assure her, in his easy casual
tone.For a long time the girl sat reflecting, while he studied her,
speculating eagerly on her next remark.Then it came abruptly:

"Mr.Ames, I have thought a great deal about it, and I think you
people by your charity, such as this, only make more charity
necessary.Why don't you do away with poverty altogether?"Well, that's quite impossible, you know.'The poor
ye have always with you', eh?She was
deeply serious, for charity to her meant love, and love was all in
all."No," she finally replied, shaking her head, "you do _not_ know your
Bible.It is the poor thought that you have always with you, the
thought of separation from good.And that thought becomes manifested
outwardly in what is called poverty."He regarded her quizzically, while a smile played about his mouth."Why don't you get at the very root of the trouble, and destroy the
poverty-thought, the thought that there can be any separation from
God, who is infinite good?""Well, my dear girl, as for me, I don't know anything about God.As
for you, well, you are very innocent in worldly matters.Poverty, like
death, is inevitable, you know.""Well, well," he returned brightly, "that's good news!Then there is
no such thing as 'the survival of the fittest,' and the weak needn't
necessarily sink, eh?"Ames, that
you have survived as one of the fittest?"Well, now--what would you say about that?""I should say decidedly no," was the blunt reply.A dark shade crossed his face, and he bit his lip.People did not
generally talk thus to him.And yet--this wisp of a girl!how beautiful, as she sat there
beside him, her head erect, and her face delicately flushed.He
reached over and took her hand."You are the kind," she went on, "who give money to the poor, and then
take it away from them again.All the money which these rich people
here to-night are giving to charity has been wrested from the poor.And you give only a part of it back to them, at that.This Ball is
just a show, a show of dress and jewels.Why, it only sets an example
which makes others unhappy, envious, and discontented."My dear little girl," he said in a patronizing tone, "don't you think
you are assuming a great deal?I'm sure I'm not half so bad as you
paint me.""Well, the money you give away has got to come from
some source, hasn't it?And you manipulate the stock market and put
through wheat corners and all that, and catch the poor people and take
their money from them!But your idea of charity makes
me pity you.Up here I find a man can pile up hundreds of millions by
stifling competition, by debauching legislatures, by piracy and
legalized theft, and then give a tenth of it to found a university,
and so atone for his crimes.Oh, I know a lot
about such things!I've been studying and thinking a great deal since
I came to the United States."And there was a touch of
aspersion in his voice."I've come with a message," she replied eagerly."Well," he said sharply, "let me warn and advise you: don't join the
ranks of the muck-rakers, as most ambitious reformers with messages
do.I can tear down as easily as you or
anybody else.But to build something better is entirely another
matter.""Well, what is it, if I may
ask?"Well, perhaps that's so," he said, bending toward her and
again attempting to take her hand."I guess," she said, drawing back quickly, "you don't know what love
is, do you?""Of course I will," she said brightly.And you'll have to do just as I tell you," holding up an admonitory
finger."I'm yours to command, little woman," he returned in mock seriousness."Well," she began very softly, "you must first learn that love is just
as much a principle as the Binomial Theorem in algebra.And you must apply it just as you would apply any
principle, to everything."You sweet little thing," he murmured absently, gazing down into her
glowing face.I
wonder--I wonder if you really are a daughter of the Incas.""Yes," she said, "I am a
princess."You look like--I wonder--pshaw!"And--do you know?--I wish I might
be your prince."But then her bright
smile faded, and she looked off wistfully down the long corridor."I'll send him a challenge
to-night!""No," she murmured gently, "you can't.And,
oh, he was so good to me!He made me leave that country on account of
the war."This innocent girl little knew that one of
the instigators of that bloody revolution sat there beside her.Then a
new thought flashed into his brain."What is the full name of this
priest?""Jose--Jose de Rincon," she whispered reverently.Jose de Rincon--of Simiti--whom Wenceslas had made the scapegoat of
the revolution!And who, according to a
recent report from Wenceslas, had been arrested and--

"A--a--where did you say this--this Jose was, little girl?"You know, he never was a priest at heart.But, though he saw the
truth, in part, he was not able to prove it enough to set himself
free; and so when I came away he stayed behind to work out his
problem.And he will work it all out," she mused abstractedly, looking
off into the distance; "he will work it all out and come--to me.I
am--I am working with him, now--and for him.And--" her voice dropped
to a whisper, "I love him, oh, so much!"His mouth opened; then shut again with a
sharp snap.That beautiful creature now belonged to him, and to none
other!Were there other claimants, he would crush them without mercy!As for this apostate priest, Jose--humph!if he still lived he should
rot the rest of his days in the reeking dungeons of San Fernando!"When he comes to me," she said softly, "we are
going to give ourselves to the whole world.""And--perhaps--perhaps, by that time, you will be--be--"

"Well?"snapped the man, irritated by the return of her thought to
himself.Perhaps by that time you will--you will love everybody," she
murmured."Perhaps you won't go on piling up big mountains of money
that you can't use, and that you won't let anybody else use.""You will know then that Jesus founded his great empire on love.Your
empire, you know, is human business.But you will find that such
empires crumble and fall."Say," he exclaimed, turning full upon her and seeming to bear her
down by his tremendous personality, "you young and inexperienced
reformers might learn a few things, too, if your prejudices could be
surmounted.Has it ever occurred to you that we men of business think
not so much about accumulating money as about achieving success?Do
you suppose you could understand that money-making is but a side issue
with us?""Yes," the girl went on, as if in quiet soliloquy, "I suppose you
are--a tremendous worldly success.And this Ball--it is a splendid
success, too.Thousands of dollars will be raised for the poor.And
then, next year, the same thing will have to be done again.Your
charities cost you hundreds of millions every year up here.And,
meantime, you rich men will go right on making more money at the
expense of your fellow-men--and you will give a little of it to the
poor when the next Charity Ball comes around.It's like a circle,
isn't it?"she said, smiling queerly up at him."It has no end, you
know."Ames had now decided to swallow his annoyance and meet the girl with
the lance of frivolity."Yes, I guess that's so," he began."But of
course you will admit that the world is slowly getting better, and
that world-progress must of necessity be gradual.We can't reform all
in a minute, can we?""I don't know how fast you might reform if you
really, sincerely tried.And if
you, a great, big, powerful man, with the most wonderful opportunities
in the world, should really try to be a success, why--well, I'm sure
you'd make very rapid progress, and help others like you by setting
such a great example.For you are a wonderful man--you really are."Ames looked at her long and quizzically.Then
he took her hand, this time without resistance."Tell me, little girl--although I know there can be no doubt of
it--are you a success?"he ejaculated, "would
you mind telling me just why?"She smiled up at him, and her sweet trustfulness drew his sagging
heartstrings suddenly taut."Because," she said simply, "I strive every moment to 'acquire that
mind which was in Christ Jesus.'"From amusement to wonder, to irritation, to
anger, then to astonishment, and a final approximation to something
akin to reverent awe had been the swift course of the man's emotions
as he sat in this secluded nook beside this strange girl.The
poisoned arrows of his worldly thought had broken one by one against
the shield of her protecting faith.His badinage had returned to
confound himself.The desire to possess had utterly fled before the
conviction that such thought was as wildly impossible as iniquitous.Then he suddenly became conscious that the little body beside him had
drawn closer--that it was pressing against him--that a little hand had
stolen gently into his--and that a soft voice, soft as the summer
winds that sigh among the roses, was floating to his ears."To be really great is to be like that wonderful man, Jesus.It is to
know that through him the great Christ-principle worked and did those
things which the world will not accept, because it thinks them
miracles.It is to know that God is love, and to act that knowledge.It is to know that love is the Christ-principle, and that it will
destroy every error, every discord, everything that is unlike itself.It is to yield your present false sense of happiness and good to the
true sense of God as infinite good.It is to bring every thought into
captivity to this Christ-principle, love.It is to stop looking at
evil as a reality.It is to let go your hold on it, and let it fade
away before the wonderful truth that God is everywhere, and that there
isn't anything apart from Him.*       *       *       *       *

How long they sat in the quiet that followed, neither knew.Then the
man suffered himself to be led silently back to the ball room again.And when he had recovered and restored his worldly self, the bright
little image was no longer at his side."Stand here, Jude, an' when they begins to come out to their gasoline
carts grab anything ye can, an' git.The shivering woman crept closer to the curb, and the man slouched
back against the wall close to the exit from which the revelers would
soon emerge.A distant clock over a jeweler's window chimed the hour
of four.A moment later the door opened, and a lackey came out and
loudly called the number of the Hawley-Crowles car.That ecstatically
happy woman, with Carmen and the obsequious young Duke of Altern,
appeared behind him in the flood of light.As the big car drew softly up, the wretched creature whom the man had
called Jude darted from behind it and plunged full at Carmen.But the
girl had seen her coming, and she met her with outstretched arm.The
glare from the open door fell full upon them.With a quick movement the girl
tore the string of pearls from her neck and thrust it into Jude's
hand.The latter turned swiftly and darted into the blackness of the
street.Then Carmen hurriedly entered the car, followed by her
stupefied companions.It had all been done in a moment of time.Hawley-Crowles, when she had recovered her
composure sufficiently to speak.And the Duke of Altern rubbed his weak eyes
and tried hard to think.Hawley-Crowles sought her bed that morning the east was
red with the winter sun."The loss of the pearls is bad enough," she
exclaimed in conclusion, glowering over the young girl who sat before
her, "for I paid a good three thousand for the string!But, in
addition, to scandalize me before the world--oh, how could you?And
this unspeakable Jude--and that awful house--heavens, girl!Who would
believe your story if it should get out?"The worried woman's face was
bathed in cold perspiration."But--she saved me from--from that place," protested the harassed
Carmen."She was poor and cold--I could see that.Why should I have
things that I don't need when others are starving?"Hawley-Crowles shook her weary head in despair.Reed, who had sat fixing the girl with her cold eyes throughout the
stormy interview following their return from the ball, now offered a
suggestion."The thing to do is to telephone immediately to all the
newspapers, and say that her beads were stolen last night.""But they weren't stolen," asserted the girl."I gave them to her--"

"Go to your room!"Hawley-Crowles, at the limit of her
endurance."And never, under any circumstances, speak of this affair
to any one--never!"The social crown, which had rested none too securely upon the gilded
wig of the dynamic Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, had been given a jolt that set
it tottering.*       *       *       *       *

It was very clear to Mrs.J. Wilton Ames after the Charity Ball that
she was engaged in a warfare to the death, and with the most
relentless of enemies.Nothing short of the miraculous could now
dethrone the detested Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her beautiful,
mysterious ward.She dolefully acknowledged to herself and to the
sulking Kathleen that she had been asleep, that she had let her foot
slip, and that her own husband's conduct in leading the grand march
with Carmen bade fair to give the _coup de grace_ to a social prestige
which for many weeks had been decidedly on the wane."Mamma, we'll have to think up some new stunts," said the dejected
Kathleen over the teacups the noon following the ball."Why, they've
even broken into the front page of the newspapers with a fake jewelry
theft!Look, they pretend that the little minx was robbed of her
string of pearls last night on leaving the hall.Ames's lip curled in disdain as she read the news item."An Inca
princess, indeed!Why doesn't
somebody take the trouble to investigate her?They'd probably find her
an outcast.""Couldn't papa look her up?"She had no wish to discuss her husband, after
the affair of the previous evening.And, even in disregard of that,
she would not have gone to him with the matter.For she and her
consort, though living under the same roof, nevertheless saw each
other but seldom.At times they met in the household elevator; and for
the sake of appearances they managed to dine together with Kathleen in
a strained, unnatural way two or three times a week, at which times no
mention was ever made of the son who had been driven from the parental
roof.There were no exchanges of confidences or affection, and Mrs.Ames knew but little of the working of his mentality.She was wholly
under the dominance of her masterful husband, merely an accessory to
his mode of existence.He used her, as he did countless others, to
buttress a certain side of his very complex life.As for assistance in
determining Carmen's status, there was none to be obtained from him,
strongly attracted by the young girl as he had already shown himself
to be.Indeed, she might be grateful if the attachment did not lead to
far unhappier consequences!"Larry Beers said yesterday that he had something new," she replied
irrelevantly to Kathleen's question."He has in tow a Persian dervish,
who sticks knives through his mouth, and drinks melted lead, and bites
red-hot pokers, and a lot of such things.Larry says he's the most
wonderful he's ever seen, and I'm going to have him and a real Hindu
_swami_ for next Wednesday evening."New York's conspicuous set indeed would have languished often but for
the social buffoonery of the clever Larry Beers, who devised new
diversions and stimulating mental condiments for the jaded brains of
that gilded cult.His table ballets, his bizarre parlor circuses, his
cunningly devised fads in which he set forth his own inimitable
antics, won him the motley and the cap and bells of this tinseled
court, and forced him well out into the glare of publicity, which was
what he so much desired.And by that much it made him as dangerous as any stupid anarchist who
toils by candle-light over his crude bombs.For by it he taught the
great mass of citizenship who still retained their simple ideals of
reason and respect that there existed a social caste, worshipers of
the golden calf, to whom the simple, humdrum virtues were quite
unendurable, and who, utterly devoid of conscience, would quaff
champagne and dance on the raw, quivering hearts of their fellow-men
with glee, if thereby their jaded appetites for novelty and
entertainment might be for the moment appeased.And so Larry Beers brought his _swami_ and dervish to the Ames
mansion, and caused his hostess to be well advertised in the
newspapers the following day.And he caused the eyes of Carmen to
bulge, and her thought to swell with wonder, as she gazed.And he
caused the bepowdered nose of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to stand a bit
closer to the perpendicular, while she sat devising schemes to cast a
shade over this clumsy entertainment.The chief result was that, a week later, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, still
running true to form, retorted with a superb imitation of the French
_Bal de l'Opera_, once so notable under the Empire.The Beaubien had
furnished the inspiring idea--and the hard cash."Why do I continue
to lend her money and take her notes?I don't--I don't seem to feel that way now.Or is it because I hate that Ames woman so?I wonder if I do still
hate her?At any rate I'm glad to see Carmen oust the proud hussy from
her place.It's worth all I've spent, even if I burn the notes I hold
against Jim Crowles's widow."And often after that, when at night the Beaubien had sought her bed,
she would lie for hours in the dim light meditating, wondering.I'm not the same woman I was when she came into my life.Oh,
God bless her--if there is a God!"The mock _Bal de l'Opera_ was a magnificent _fete_.All the members of
the smart set were present, and many appeared in costumes representing
flowers, birds, and vegetables.Carmen went as a white rose; and her
great natural beauty, set off by an exquisite costume, made her the
fairest flower of the whole garden.The Duke of Altern, costumed as a
long carrot, fawned in her wake throughout the evening.The tubbily
girthy Gannette, dressed to represent a cabbage, opposed her every
step as he bobbed before her, showering his viscous compliments upon
the graceful creature.Kathleen Ames appeared as a bluebird; and she
would have picked the fair white rose to pieces if she could, so
wildly jealous did she become at the sight of Carmen's further
triumph.About midnight, when the revelry was at its height, a door at the end
of the hall swung open, and a strong searchlight was turned full upon
it.The orchestra burst into the wailing dead march from _Saul_, and
out through the glare of light stalked the giant form of J. Wilton
Ames, gowned in dead black to represent a King Vulture, and with a
blood-red fez surmounting his cruel mask.As he stepped out upon the
platform which had been constructed to represent the famous bridge in
"_Sumurun_," and strode toward the main floor, a murmur involuntarily
rose from the assemblage.It was a murmur of awe, of horror, of fear.The "_monstrum horrendum_" of Poe was descending upon them in the garb
which alone could fully typify the character of the man!When he
reached the end of the bridge the huge creature stopped and distended
his enormous sable wings.cried Gannette, as he thought of his tremendous financial
obligations to Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away from the awful spectacle."I want to
go," she said to the petrified Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had known
nothing of this feature of the program.Straight to the trembling, white-clad girl the great, black vulture
stalked.The revelers fell away from him on either side as he
approached.Carmen turned again and watched him come.A light came into her eyes, and a smile
wreathed her mouth.And when Ames reached her and extended his huge,
black wings again, she walked straight into them with a look of joy
upon her beautiful face.Then the wings closed and completely hid the
fair, white form from the gaping crowd.For a few moments dead silence reigned throughout the hall.Then the
orchestra crashed, the vulture's wings slowly opened, and the girl,
who would have gone to the stake with the same incomprehensible smile,
stepped out.The black monster turned and strode silently, ominously,
back to the end of the hall, crossed the bridge, and disappeared
through the door which opened at his approach.said the shaken Gannette to his perspiring wife.That girl's done for; and Ames has taken this
way to publicly announce the fact!There was another astonished watcher in the audience that evening.It
was the eminent Monsignor Lafelle, recently back from Europe by way of
the West Indies.And after the episode just related, he approached
Carmen and Mrs."A very clever, if startling, performance," he commented; "and with
two superb actors, Mr.Ames and our little friend here," bowing over
Carmen's hand."I am _so_ glad you could accept our invitation, Monsignor.I haven't got my breath yet," panted the steaming Mrs."Do take us, Monsignor, to the refectory.A few moments later, over their iced drinks, Lafelle was relating
vivid incidents of his recent travels, and odd bits of news from
Cartagena."No, Miss Carmen," he said, in reply to her anxious
inquiries, "I did not meet the persons you have mentioned.And as for
getting up the Magdalena river, it would have been quite impossible.Dismiss from your mind all thought of going down there now.And the
little town of Simiti which you mention, I doubt not it is quite shut
off from the world by the war."Carmen turned aside that he might not see the tears which welled into
her eyes."Your entertainment, Madam," continued Lafelle, addressing the now
recovered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "is superb, as have been all of your
social projects this winter, I learn.The thought which you expressed
to me some months ago regarding Catholic activity in social matters
certainly was well founded.I perceive that our Protestant rivals have
all but retired from the field."Hawley-Crowles swelled with pride.Carmen regarded the churchman
with wonder."And have you not found a sense of peace, of satisfaction and comfort,
since you united with the true Church?""Are you not
at last at rest?""Quite so," sighed the lady, though the sigh was scarcely one of
unalloyed relief."And our little friend here--can she still
remain an alien, now that she has some knowledge of her indebtedness
to the Church?""Why--"

It was now Lafelle's turn to sigh, as he directed himself again to
Mrs."She does not see, Madam, that it was by the
ladder of Holy Church that she mounted to her present enviable social
height.""But--what--what do you mean?""May I not come and explain it to her?"Then he suddenly
thought of his last conversation with the Beaubien.But he shrugged
his shoulders, and a defiant look sat upon his features.Hawley-Crowles dared not refuse the request.She knew she was now
too deeply enmeshed for resistance, and that Lafelle's control over
her was complete--unless she dared to face social and financial ruin.And under that thought she paled and grew faint, for it raised the
curtain upon chaos and black night."Would it be convenient for me to call to-morrow afternoon?"Hawley-Crowles in a scarcely audible
voice."By the way," Lafelle said, suddenly turning the conversation, "how,
may I ask, is our friend, Madam Beaubien?"Hawley-Crowles again trembled slightly."I--I have not seen her
much of late, Monsignor," she said feebly."A strong and very liberal-minded woman," returned Lafelle with
emphasis."I trust, as your spiritual adviser, Madam, I may express
the hope that you are in no way influenced by her."cried Carmen, who had bounded to her feet, her eyes ablaze,
"Madam Beaubien is a noble woman!"Lafelle grasped her hand and drew her back into her
chair.Madam Beaubien is a very dear
friend of ours, and we greatly admire her strength of character.She
certainly does not require your defense!A few moments later he rose and offered his arms to his companions to
lead them back to the hall.Delivering Carmen into the charge of the
eagerly waiting Duke of Altern, Lafelle remarked, as he took leave of
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I trust you will permit me to talk with your
beautiful ward to-morrow afternoon--alone."And when the lady
interpreted the significance of his look, her heart beat rapidly, as
she bowed her acknowledgment of abject submission.ejaculated the young Duke, clutching Carmen."Ye know, I
was deucedly afraid you had gone home, or that Uncle Wilton had you.Ye know, I think I'm jealous of him!"Carmen laughed merrily at the fellow.His grotesque costume made him
appear still more ridiculous."It's nothing to laugh at, Miss Carmen!It's a bally bore to have a
regular mountain like him always getting in the way; and to-night I
just made up my mind I wouldn't stand it any longer, bah Jove!He fixed his monocle savagely in his eye and strode rapidly toward
the refreshment hall.She heard his murmur of
gratification when his gaze lighted upon the chairs and table which
he had evidently arranged previously in anticipation of this
_tete-a-tete_."Ye know," he finally began, after they were seated and he had sat
some minutes staring at the girl, "ye know, you're deucedly clevah,
Miss Carmen!I told mother so to-day, and this time she had to agree.And that about your being an Inca princess--ye know, I could see that
from the very first day I met you.Mighty romantic, and all that,
don't ye know!"replied the girl, her thought drifting back to distant
Simiti."And all about that mine you own in South America--and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles making you her heiress--and all that--bah Jove!It's--it's romantic, I tell you!"His head continued to nod emphasis
to his thought long after he finished speaking."Ye know," he finally resumed, drawing a gold-crested case from a
pocket and lighting a monogrammed cigarette, "a fellow can always tell
another who is--well, who belongs to the aristocracy.Ames, ye
know, said she had some suspicions about you.But I could see right
off that it was because she was jealous.Mother and I knew what you
were the minute we clapped eyes on you.That's because we belong to
the nobility, ye know.""Bah Jove, Miss Carmen, I'm going to say it!""Mother wanted me to marry Lord Cragmont's filly; but, bah Jove, I
say, I'm going to marry you!"Carmen now heard, and she quickly sat up, her eyes wide and staring.You're a princess, ye know,
and so you're in our class.I'm not one of the kind that hands out a
title to the red-nosed daughter of any American pork packer just to
get her money.The girl I marry has got to be my equal.""It's all right for you to have money, of course.I won't marry a
pauper, even if she's a duchess.But you and I, Miss Carmen, are just
suited to each other--wealth and nobility on each side.I've got
thirty thousand good British acres in my own right, bah Jove!"By now Carmen had fully recovered from her surprise.She reflected a
moment, then determined to meet the absurd youth with the spirit of
levity which his audacity merited."But, Reginald," she said in mock
seriousness, "though your father was a duke, how about your mother?Was she not just an ordinary American girl, a sister of plain Mrs.Now on my side--"

"Now, Miss Carmen," cried the boy petulantly, "can't you see that, by
marrying my father, my mother became ennobled?Bah Jove, you don't
understand!he whispered, leaning far over the table toward her."Then we've simply _got_ to marry!""But," protested the girl, "in my country people love those whom they
marry.I haven't heard a word of that from you."It was
love that made me offer you my name and title!""My dear Reginald, you don't love me.You are madly in love, it is true; but it is
with the young Duke of Altern.""See here, you can't talk to me that way, ye know!""Bah Jove, I'm offering to make you a duchess--and I love you, too,
though you may not think it!""Of course you love me, Reginald," said Carmen in gentle reply, now
relinquishing her spirit of badinage; "and I love you.But I do not
wish to marry you."The young man started under the shock and stared at her in utter lack
of comprehension.Was it possible that this unknown girl was refusing
him, a duke?"A--a--I don't get you, Miss Carmen," he stammered."Come," she said, rising and holding out a hand."Let's not talk about
this any more.I do love you, Reginald,
but not in the way that perhaps you would like.I love the real _you_;
not the vain, foolish, self-adoring human concept, called the Duke of
Altern.And the love I feel for you will help you, oh, far more than
if I married you!"I--I expected we'd be engaged--I told mother--"

"Very well, Reginald, we are engaged.Engaged in handling this little
problem that has presented itself to you.And I will help
you to solve it in the right way.Reginald dear, I
didn't mean to treat your proposal so lightly.We're just awfully good friends, aren't we?And I do
love you, more than you think."Leaving the bewildered youth in the hall, Carmen fell afoul of the
very conservative Mrs.Gannette, whose husband, suffering from a sense
of nausea since the appearance of Ames as a King Vulture, had some
moments before summoned his car and driven to his favorite club to
flood his apprehensions with Scotch high-balls.Gannette, shaking a finger at
Carmen."I saw you with Reginald just now.Tell me, dear, when shall we be able to call you the Duchess
of Altern?Carmen's spirits sank, as, without reply, she submitted to the banal
boredom of this blustering dame's society gabble.Gannette hooked
her arm into the girl's and led her to a divan."It's a great affair,
isn't it?"she panted, settling her round, unshapely form out over the
seat.Thought that was better adapted to my shape.But when
I got the cloth form around me, do you know, I couldn't get through
the door!And my unlovely pig of a husband said if I came looking like
that he'd get a divorce."The corpulent dame shook and wheezed with
the expression of her abundant merriment."Well," she continued, "it wasn't his threat that hindered me,
goodness knows!A divorce would be a relief, after living forty years
with him!Speaking of divorce,
he's just got one.Billy Patterson
dared him to exchange wives with him one evening when they were having
a little too much gaiety at the Worley home, and the doctor took the
dare.Kate Worley gets an alimony of
fifty thousand per.Why, he has a
practice of not less than two hundred and fifty thousand a year!""I supposed," murmured Carmen, "that amount of money is a measure of
his ability, a proof of his great usefulness.""He's simply in with the
wealthy, that's all.Carmen glanced at the pale, slender woman across the hall, seated
alone, and wearing a look of utter weariness."I'd like to meet her," she said, suddenly drawn by the woman's mute
appeal for sympathy."She's going to be
dropped.Hawley-Crowles was thinking of to invite her to-night!Her estate is
being handled by Ames and Company, and J. Wilton says there won't be
much left when it's settled--

"My goodness!"she exclaimed, abruptly flitting to another topic.Look at her skirt--flounced at the knees, and
full in the back so's to give a bustle effect.I wish I could wear
togs cut that way--

"They say, my dear," the garrulous old worldling prattled on, "that
next season's styles will be very ultra.Hats
small and round, like the heads of butterflies.Waists and jackets
very full and quite loose in the back and shoulders, so's to give the
appearance of wings.Belts, but no drawing in at the waist.Skirts
plaited, plaits opening wide at the knees and coming close together
again at the ankle, so's to look like the body of a butterfly.Then
butterfly bows sprinkled all over.""Oh dear," she
lamented, "I'd give anything if I had a decent shape!I'd like to wear
those shimmering, flowing, transparent summer things over silk tights.I'd look like a potato busted wide open.Now you can
wear those X-ray dresses all right--

"Say, Kathleen Ames has a new French gown to wear to the Dog Show.Skirt slit clear to the knee, with diamond garter around the leg just
below.Carmen heard little of this vapid talk, as she sat studying the pale
woman across the hall.She had resolved to meet her just as soon as
the loquacious Mrs.But that
genial old gossip gave no present evidence of a desire to change."I'm _so_ glad you're going to marry young Altern," she said, again
swerving the course of her conversation."He's got a fine old ruined
castle somewhere in England, and seems to have wads of money, though I
hear that everything is mortgaged to Ames.Still, his bare title is worth something to an American girl.And you'll do a lot for his family.You know--but
don't breathe a word of this!--his mother never was recognized
socially in England, and she finally had to give up the fight.For a
while Ames backed her, but it wouldn't do.His millions couldn't buy
her the court entree, and she just had to quit.That's why she's over
here now.The old Duke--he was lots older than she--died a couple of
years ago.Ran through everything and drank himself to death.Before
and since that happy event the Duchess did everything under the
heavens to get a bid to court.She gave millions to charity and to
entertainments.You're
a princess, royal Inca, and such like.So you see what you're expected to do for the Altern crowd--

"Dear!catching her breath and switching quickly to another
theme, "have you heard about the Hairton scandal?You see, young Sidney Ames--"

Carmen's patience had touched its limit.she
begged, holding out a hand.Gannette raised her lorgnette and looked at the girl.The scandal's about Ames's son, you know.The
reason he doesn't go in society.You see--"

"My dear Mrs.Gannette," Carmen looked up at her with a beseeching
smile."You wouldn't deliberately give me poison to drink, would
you?"blustered that garrulous lady in astonishment."Then why do you poison my mind with such conversation?""You sit there pouring into my mentality thought after thought that is
deadly poisonous, don't you know it?""You don't mean to harm me, I know," pleaded the girl."But if you
only understood mental laws you would know that every thought entering
one's mind tends to become manifested in some way.Thoughts of
disease, disaster, death, scandal--all tend to become externalized in
discordant ways, either on the body, or in the environment.You don't
want any such things manifested to me, do you?But you might just as
well hand me poison to drink as to sit there and pour such deadly
conversation into me."Gannette slowly drew herself up with the hauteur of a grandee."I do not want to listen to these unreal
things which concern only the human mind," she said earnestly."Nor
should you, if you are truly aristocratic, for aristocracy is of the
thought.I am not going to marry Reginald.But one's thought--that alone is one's claim to _real_
aristocracy.I know I have offended you, but only because I refuse to
let you poison me.She left the divan and the petrified dame, and hurriedly mingled with
the crowd on the floor.Gannette, when she again found
herself.Carmen went directly to the pale woman, still sitting alone, who had
been one of the objects of Mrs.The
woman glanced up as she saw the girl approaching, and a look of wonder
came into her eyes."I am Carmen Ariza," she said simply.The woman roused up and tried to appear composed."Will you ride with me to-morrow?""Then we can talk
all we want to, with nobody to overhear.she
abruptly added, unable longer to withstand the appeal which issued
mutely from the lusterless eyes before her."I am poverty-stricken," returned the woman sadly."But I will give you money," Carmen quickly replied."My dear child," said the woman, "I haven't anything but money.That
is why I am poverty-stricken."the girl exclaimed, sinking into a chair at her side."Well,"
she added, brightening, "now you have me!And will you call me up,
first thing in the morning, and arrange to ride with me?"Yes," she murmured, "I will--gladly."In the small hours of the morning there were several heads tossing in
stubborn wakefulness on their pillows in various New York mansions.CHAPTER 17


On the morning following Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's very successful
imitation of the _Bal de l'Opera_, Monsignor Lafelle paid an early
call to the Ames _sanctum_.And the latter gentleman deemed the visit
of sufficient importance to devote a full hour to his caller.When the
churchman rose to take his leave he reiterated:

"Our friend Wenceslas will undertake the matter for you, Mr.Ames, but
on the conditions which I have named.But Rome must be communicated
with, and the substance of her replies must be sent from Cartagena to
you, and your letters forwarded to her.That might take us into early
summer.Ketchim's engineers will
make any further attempt before that time to enter Colombia.Harris is in Denver, at his old home, you
tell me.So we need look for no immediate move from them.""Quite satisfactory, Lafelle," returned Ames genially."In future, if
I can be of service to you, I am yours to command.Willett will
hand you a check covering your traveling expenses on my behalf."When the door closed after Lafelle, Ames leaned back in his chair and
gave himself up to a moment's reflection."I wonder," he mused, "I
wonder if the fellow has something up his sleeve that he didn't show
me?I'm going to drop him after this trap is
sprung.He's got Jim Crowles's widow all tied up, too.if he begins work on that girl I'll--"

He was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone bell.shouted Ames, "you say the girl insulted your
wife last evening?I don't believe she could--Yes, yes, I mean, I
don't think she meant to--certainly not, no aspersion whatever
intended--What?the girl will have to apologize?--Well!well--No,
not in a thousand years!--Yes, I'll back her!And if your society
isn't good enough for her--and I don't think it is--why, I'll form
a little coterie all by myself!""I want a dozen brokers watching Gannette now until I call them off,"
he commanded."I want you to take personal charge of them."Lucile
already has Gannette pretty well wound up in his Venezuelan
speculations--and they are going to smash--Lafelle has fixed that.And
I've bought her notes against Mrs.Hawley-Crowles for about a
million--which I have reinvested for her in Colombia.She'll
feed out of my hand now!La Libertad is mine when the trap falls.So
is C. and R. And that little upstart, Ketchim, goes to Sing Sing!"He turned to the morning paper that lay upon his desk."I don't like
the way the Colombian revolution drags," he mused."But certainly it
can't last much longer.And then--then--"

His thoughts wandered off into devious channels."So Jose de Rincon
is--well!But--where on earth did
that girl come from?There's a lot of experience coming to
her.And then she'll drop a few of her pious notions.Lucile says--but
Lucile is getting on my nerves!"*       *       *       *       *

Monsignor Lafelle found Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward awaiting him
when his car drove up at two that afternoon.Carmen had not left the
house during the morning, for Elizabeth Wall had telephoned early that
a slight indisposition would necessitate postponement of the
contemplated ride."Well," reflected Carmen, as she turned from the 'phone, "one who
knows that God is everywhere can never be disappointed, for all good
is ever present."And then she set about preparing for the expected
call of Monsignor Lafelle.When that dignitary entered the parlor Mrs.Hawley-Crowles graciously
welcomed him, and then excused herself."I will leave her with you,
Monsignor," she said, indicating Carmen, and secretly glad to escape a
presence which she greatly feared.Lafelle bowed, and then waved
Carmen to a seat."I have come to-day, Miss Carmen," he began easily, "on a mission of
vastest importance as concerning your welfare.I have talked with the acting-Bishop there, who, it seems,
is not wholly unacquainted with you.""Then," cried Carmen eagerly, "you know where Padre Jose is?And the
others--"

"No," replied Lafelle."I regret to say I know nothing of their
present whereabouts."I have long since done that," said Carmen softly."It is of yourself that I wish to speak," continued Lafelle."I have
come to offer you the consolation, the joy, and the protection of the
Church.Hawley-Crowles, has found peace
with us.Will you longer delay taking a step toward which you are by
race, by national custom, and by your Saviour admonished?I have come
to invite you to publicly confess your allegiance to the Church of
Rome.Hawley-Crowles, is one
of us.And you, my
daughter, now need the Church," he added with suggestive emphasis.Hawley-Crowles had hinted the probable
mission of the churchman, and the girl was prepared."I thank you, Monsignor," she replied simply."My child, it is quite
necessary!""But I have my salvation, ever present."My dear child, do not lean upon your pretty theories in the hope that
they will open the door of heaven for you.There is no salvation
outside of the Church.""Monsignor," said Carmen gently, "such talk is very foolish.Can you
prove to me that your Church ever sent any one to heaven?Have you any
but a very mediaeval and material concept of heaven?It is the consciousness of good only, without a trace of
materiality or evil.And I enter into that consciousness by means of
the Christ-principle, which Jesus gave to the world.It is very
simple, is it not?And it makes all your pomp and ceremony, and your
penance and rites quite unnecessary."He had certain suspicions, but he was not
ready to voice them.Carmen went on:

"Monsignor, I love my fellow-men, oh, _so_ much!I want to see every
one work out his salvation, as Jesus bade us all do, and without any
hindrance from others.And I ask but that same privilege from every
one, yourself included.Let me work out my salvation as my Father has
directed.""I have no wish to hinder you, child.On
the contrary, I offer you the assistance and infallible guidance of
the Church.Beginning nineteen
centuries ago, when we were divinely appointed custodian of the
world's morals, our history has been a glorious one.We have in that
time changed a pagan world into one that fears God and follows His
Christ.""But for nineteen hundred years, Monsignor, the various so-called
Christian sects of the world have been persecuting and slaying one
another over their foolish beliefs, basing their religious theories
upon their interpretations of the Bible.Surely that is not a glorious
history!"You unwittingly argue directly for our cause, my child.The
result which you have just cited proves conclusively that the
Scriptures can not be correctly interpreted by every one.That is
perfectly patent to you, I see.Thus you acknowledge the necessity of
an infallible guide.That is to be found only in the spiritual
Fathers, and in the Pope, the holy Head of the Church of Rome, the
present Vicegerent of Christ on earth.""Then your interpretation of the Bible is the only correct one?""And you Catholics are the only true followers of Christ?"Come, Monsignor, I will get my coat and hat.he asked in amazement, as he slowly got to
his feet."Jesus said: 'He that believeth on
me, the works that I do shall he do also.'I am going to take you over
to the home of old Maggie, our cook's mother.You will
heal her, for you are a true follower of Christ.""Well--but, hasn't she a doctor?""Yes, but he can't help her.You should be able to do the works
which he did.You can change the wafer and wine into the flesh and
blood of Jesus.How much easier, then, and vastly more practical, to
cure a sick woman!Wait, I will be back in a minute.""But, you impetuous child, I shall go on no such foolish errand as
that!""If the woman were dying or dead, and you were
summoned, you would go, would you not?"And if she were dying you would put holy oil on her, and pray--but it
wouldn't make her well.And if she were dead, you would say Masses for
the repose of her soul.Monsignor, did it never occur to you that the
great works which you claim to do are all done behind the veil of
death?You can do but little for mankind here; but you pretend to do
much after they have passed beyond the grave.Is it quite fair to the
poor and ignorant, I ask, to work that way?Did it never strike you as
remarkable and very consistent that Jesus, whenever he launched a
great truth, immediately ratified it by some great sign, some sign
which the world now calls a miracle?The Gospels are full of such
instances, where he first taught, then came down and immediately
healed some one, thus at once putting his teaching to the proof.Your Church has taught and thundered and denounced
for ages, but what has it proved?You teach the so-called practical Christianity which makes a reality
of evil and an eternal necessity of hospitals and orphan asylums.If
you did his works the people would be so uplifted that these things
would be wiped out.Your Church has had nineteen hundred years in
which to learn to do the works which he did.Now come over to Maggie's
with me and prove that you are a true follower and believer, and that
the Church has given you the right sort of practical instruction!"Gradually the girl's voice waxed stronger while she delivered this
polemic.Slowly the churchman's face darkened, as he moved backward
and sank into his chair."Now, Monsignor, having scolded you well," the girl continued, smiling
as she sat down again, "I will apologize.But you needed the
scolding--you know you did!And nearly all who profess the name of
Christ need the same.Monsignor, I love you all, and every one,
whether Catholic or Protestant, or whatever his creed.But that does
not blind my eyes to your great need, and to your obstinate refusal to
make any effort to meet that need."A cynical look came into the man's face."May I ask, Miss Carmen, if
you consider yourself a true follower and believer?""Monsignor," she quickly replied, rising and facing him, "you hope by
that adroit question to confound me.Listen: when I was a child my purity of thought was such that I knew
no evil.I could not see sickness or
death as anything more than unreal shadows.And that wonderful
clearness of vision and purity of thought made me a channel for the
operation of the Christ-principle, God himself.And thereby the sick
were healed in my little home town.Then, little by little, after my
beloved teacher, Jose, came to me, I lost ground in my struggle to
keep the vision clear.They did not mean to, but he and my dearest
padre Rosendo and others held their beliefs of evil as a reality so
constantly before me that the vision became obscured, and the
spirituality alloyed.The unreal forces of evil seemed to concentrate
upon me.I know why now, for the greatest good always stirs up the
greatest amount of evil--the highest truth always has the lowest lie
as its opposite and opponent.I see now, as never before, the
unreality of evil.I see now, as never before, the marvelous truth
which Jesus tried, oh, _so_ hard, to impress upon the dull minds of
his people, the truth which you refuse to see.And ceaselessly I am
now striving to acquire 'that mind,' that spiritual consciousness,
which was in him.I have been
wonderfully shielded, led, and cared for.And I shall heal, some day,
as he did.I shall regain my former spirituality, for it has never
really been lost.But, Monsignor, do not ask me to come into your
Church and allow my brightening vision to become blurred by your very
inadequate concept of God--a God who is moved by the petitions of
Saints and Virgin and mortal men.Unless," she added,
brightening, "you will let me teach your Church what I know."You see," she
said, "your Church requires absolute submission to its age-worn
authority.According to you, I have nothing to give.Very well, if
your Church can receive nothing from me, and yet can give me nothing
more than its impossible beliefs, undemonstrable this side of the
grave, at least--then we must consider that a gulf is fixed between
us."Oh, Monsignor," she pleaded, after a moment's silence, "you see, do
you not?When Jesus said that he gave his disciples power over all
evil, did he not mean likewise over all physical action, and over
every physical condition?But did he mean that they alone should have
such power?No, he meant that every
one who followed him and strove ceaselessly for spirituality of
thought should acquire that spirituality, and thereby cleanse himself
of false beliefs, and make room for the Christ-principle to operate,
even to the healing of the sick, to the raising of those mesmerized by
the belief of death as a power and reality, and to the dematerializing
of the whole material concept of the heavens and earth.Can't you, a
churchman, see it?And can't you see how shallow your views are?Don't
you know that even the physical body is but a part of the human,
material concept, and therefore a part of the 'one lie' about God, who
is Spirit?"But now his time had come to speak in
rebuttal.And yet, he would make no attempt to assail her convictions.He knew well that she would not yield--at least, to-day."Miss Carmen," he said gently, "the Church is ever doing beneficent
deeds which do not come to light, and for which she receives no praise
from men.Hawley-Crowles's elevation to social
leadership came through her.There is also a rumor that the Church
afforded you an asylum on your first night in this city, when, if
ever, you needed aid.The Church shielded and cared for you even in
Simiti.Indeed, what has she not done for you?"Monsignor," replied Carmen, "I am not unmindful of the care always
bestowed upon me.But my gratitude is to my
God, who has worked through many channels to bless me.Leave it there, and fear not that I shall prove ungrateful
to Him, to whom my every thought is consecrated."Then he spoke low and earnestly, while he held
his gaze fixed upon the girl's bright eyes."Miss Carmen, if you knew
that the Church now afforded you the only refuge from the dangers that
threaten, you would turn to her as a frightened child to its mother.""I fear nothing, Monsignor," replied the girl, her face alight with a
smile of complete confidence."I am not the kind who may be driven by
fear into acceptance of undemonstrable, unfounded theological beliefs.Fear has always been a terrible weapon in the hands of those who have
sought to force their opinions upon their fellow-men.But it is
powerless to influence me.Indeed, according to the Bible
allegory, it began in the very garden of Eden, when poor, deceived
Adam confessed to God that he was afraid.If God was infinite then, as
you admit you believe Him to be now, who or what made Adam afraid?For, 'God hath not given us
the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.'"But, surely, Miss Carmen, you will not stubbornly close your eyes to
threatening evil?""Monsignor, I close my eyes to all that is unlike God.I know nothing but Him and His perfect manifestation."The picture which he and the
young girl formed was one of rare beauty and interest: he, weighted
with years, white of hair, but rugged of form, with strikingly
handsome features and kindly eyes--she, a child, delicate, almost
wraith-like, glowing with a beauty that was not of earth, and, though
untutored in the wiles of men, still holding at bay the sagacious
representative of a crushing weight of authority which reached far
back through the centuries, even to the Greek and Latin Fathers who
put their still unbroken seal upon the strange elaborations which they
wove out of the simple words of the Nazarene.When the churchman again looked up and felt himself engulfed in the
boundless love which emanated from that radiant, smiling girl, there
surged up within him a mighty impulse to go to her, to clasp her in
his arms, to fall at her feet and pray for even a mite of her own rare
spirituality.The purpose which he had that morning formulated died
within him; the final card which he would have thrown lay crushed in
his hand."The people believe you a child of the ancient Incas," he said slowly,
taking her hand."What if I should say that I know better?""I would say that you were right, Monsignor," she replied gently,
looking up into his face with a sweet smile."Then you admit the identity of your father?"The man bent for a moment over the little white hand, and then
immediately left the house.CHAPTER 18

Monsignor Lafelle in his interview with Carmen had thrown out a hint
of certain rumors regarding her; but the days passed, and the girl
awoke not to their significance.Then, one morning, her attention was
attracted by a newspaper report of the farewell address of a young
priest about to leave his flock.When she opened the paper and caught
sight of the news item she gave a little cry, and immediately forgot
all else in her absorption in the closing words:

  "--and I have known no other ambition since the day that little
  waif from a distant land strayed into my life, lighting the dead
  lamp of my faith with the torch of her own flaming spirituality.She said she had a message for the people up here.Would to God
  she might know that her message had borne fruit!"The newspaper slipped from the girl's hands to the floor.Her eyes,
big and shining, stared straight before her."And I will lead the
blind by a way that they know not--" she murmured.It was Miss Wall, ready now for the postponed
ride.Carmen clapped her hands and sang for joy as she summoned the
car and made her preparations."We'll go over to his church," she said
aloud.She hurried back to the newspaper to get the
address of the church from which he had spoken the preceding day."They will know where he is," she said happily."Oh, isn't it just
wonderful!"A few minutes later, with Miss Wall at her side, she was speeding to
the distant suburb where the little church was located."We are going to find a priest," she said simply."Oh, you mustn't ask
me any questions!Hawley-Crowles doesn't like to have me talk
about certain things, and so I can't tell you."But the happy, smiling countenance
disarmed suspicion."Now tell me," Carmen went on, "tell me about yourself.I'm a
missionary, you know," she added, thinking of Father Waite.Well, are you trying to convert the society world?""Yes, by Christianity--not by what the missionaries are now teaching
in the name of Christianity.I'll tell you all about it some day.Now
tell me, why are you unhappy?Why is your life pitched in such a minor
key?Perhaps, together, we can change it to a major."Miss Wall could not help joining in the merry laugh."I am unhappy," she said, "because I have arrived
nowhere."Carmen looked at her inquiringly."Well," she said, "that shows you
are on the wrong track, doesn't it?""I'm tired of life--tired of everything, everybody!"Miss Wall sank
back into the cushions with her lips pursed and her brow wrinkled."No, you are not tired of life," said Carmen quietly; "for you do not
know what life is.""No, I suppose not," replied the weary woman."Oh, don't mention that name, nor quote Scripture to me!"cried the
woman, throwing up her hands in exasperation."I've had that stuff
preached at me until it turned my stomach!I hope you are not an
emotional, weepy religionist."Padre Jose used to say--"

"Who's he?"demanded Miss Wall, somewhat curtly."Oh, he is a priest--"

"A priest!do you constantly associate with priests, and talk
religion?""Well," she responded, "I've had a good deal
to do with both.""Tell me something about your
life," she said."Surely I am a princess," returned Carmen, laughing merrily."Listen;
I will tell you about big, glorious Simiti, and the wonderful castle I
lived in there, and about my Prime Minister, Don Rosendo, and--well,
listen, and then judge for yourself if I am not of royal extraction!"Laughing again up into the mystified face of Miss Wall, the
enthusiastic girl began to tell about her former life in far-off
Guamoco.As she listened, the woman's eyes grew wide with interest.At times
she voiced her astonishment in sudden exclamations.And when the girl
concluded her brief recital, she bent upon the sparkling face a look
of mingled wonder and admiration.After going through all
that, how can you be so happy now?And with all your kin down there in
that awful war!"Don't you think I am a princess now?"Carmen asked, smiling up at
her."And--you don't want to know what it was that kept me through it all,
and that is still guiding me?"The bright, animated face looked so
eagerly, so lovingly, into the world-scarred features of her
companion."Not if you are going to talk religion.Tell me, who is this priest
you are seeking to-day, and why have you come to see him?"He is the one who found me--when I got lost--and took
me to my friends."The big car whirled around a corner and stopped before a dingy little
church edifice surmounted by a weather-beaten cross.On the steps of a
modest frame house adjoining stood a man.Carmen threw wide the door of the car and sprang out.A light came into the startled man's eyes.Then he
stepped back, that he might better see her.More than a year had
passed since he had taken her, so oddly garbed, and clinging tightly
to his hand, into the Ketchim office.And in that time, he thought,
she had been transformed into a vision of heavenly beauty.And
with that she threw her arms about him and kissed him loudly on both
cheeks.The man and Miss Wall gave vent to exclamations of astonishment.He
 violently; Miss Wall sat with mouth agape.pursued the girl, again grasping his
hands."An angel from heaven could not be more
welcome," he said.But his voice was low, and the note of sadness was
prominent."Well, I am an angel from heaven," said the laughing, artless girl.But,
whoever I am, I am, oh, so glad to see you again!I--" she looked
about carefully--"I read your sermon in the newspaper this morning."Yes, I meant you," he softly answered."Come with me now," said the eager girl."Impossible," he replied, shaking his head."Then, will you come and see me?""Why have
you never been to see me?Didn't you know I was still in the city?""I used to see your name in the papers, often.And I have followed your career with great interest.But--you moved in
a circle--from which I--well, it was hardly possible for me to come to
see you, you know--"

"It was!""But, never mind, you are coming now.Here," drawing a card from her bag, "this is the address of Madam
Beaubien.Will you come there to-morrow afternoon, at two, and talk
with me?"He looked at the card which she thrust into his hand, and then at the
richly-gowned girl before him.But he
nodded his head slowly."Tell me," she whispered, "how is Sister Katie?"Ah, if the girl could have known how that great-hearted old soul had
mourned her "little bairn" these many months."I will go to see her," said Carmen."But first you will come to me
to-morrow."She beamed upon him as she clasped his hands again.Then
she entered the car, and sat waving her hand back at him as long as he
could see her.It would be difficult to say which of the two, Miss Wall or Father
Waite, was the more startled by this abrupt and lively _rencontre_.But to Carmen, as she sat back in the car absorbed in thought, it had
been a perfectly natural meeting between two warm friends."You haven't anything but money, and
fine clothes, and automobiles, and jewels, you think.asked the wondering woman, marveling at this strange
girl who went about embracing people so promiscuously.The woman's lip trembled slightly when she heard this, but she did not
reply."And I'm going to love you," the girl continued.You're
tired of society gabble and gossip; you're tired of spending on
yourself the money you never earned; you're not a bit of use to
anybody, are you?You're a sort of tragedy, aren't
you?There are just lots of them in high society, just as
weary as you.And they lack the very
greatest thing in all of life, the very thing that no amount of money
will buy, just love!they don't realize that, in
order to get, they must give.In order to be loved, they must
themselves love.Now you start right in and love the whole world, love
everybody, big and little.And, as you love people, try to see only
their perfection.Never look at a bad trait, nor a blemish of any
sort.In a week's time you will be a new woman.""I have _always_ done it," replied Carmen."I don't know anything but
love.I never knew what it was to hate or revile.I never could see
what there was that deserved hatred or loathing.I don't see anything
but good--everywhere.""I--I don't mind your talking
that way to me," she whispered."But I just couldn't bear to listen to
any more religion."Love is the
tie that binds all together and all to God.Why, Miss Wall--"

"Call me Elizabeth, please," interrupted the woman."Well then, Elizabeth," she said softly, "all creeds have got to merge
into just one, some day, and, instead of saying 'I believe,' everybody
will say 'I understand and I love.'Why, the very person who loved
more than anybody else ever did was the one who saw God most clearly!He knew that if we would see God--good everywhere--we would just
simply _have_ to love, for God _is_ love!"Do you love me, Carmen, because you pity me?""God's children are not to be
pitied--and I see in people only His children.""Well, why, then, do you love me?"The girl replied quickly: "God is love."And now," she continued cheerily, "we are going to work together,
aren't we?And then you are
going to see just what is right for you to do--what work you are to
take up--what interests you are to have."Tell me, Carmen, why are you in society?What keeps you there, in an
atmosphere so unsuited to your spiritual life?""But--"

"Well, Elizabeth dear, every step I take is ordained by Him, who is my
life.I leave everything to Him, and then
keep myself out of the way.If He wishes to use me elsewhere, He will
remove me from society.How could this girl, who, in her
few brief years, had passed through fire and flood, still love the
hand that guided her!CHAPTER 19


To the great horde of starving European nobility the daughters of
American millionaires have dropped as heavenly manna.It was but dire
necessity that forced low the bars of social caste to the transoceanic
traffic between fortune and title.Hawley-Crowles might ever aspire to the purchase of a
decrepit dukedom had never entered her thought.A tottering earldom
was likewise beyond her purchasing power.She had contented herself
that Carmen should some day barter her rare culture, her charm, and
her unrivaled beauty, for the more lowly title of an impecunious count
or baron.But to what heights of ecstasy did her little soul rise when
the young Duke of Altern made it known to her that he would honor her
beautiful ward with his own glorious name--in exchange for La Libertad
and other good and valuable considerations, receipt of which would be
duly acknowledged."I--aw--have spoken to her, ye know, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," that worthy
young cad announced one afternoon, as he sat alone with the successful
society leader in the warm glow of her living room.she said we were engaged, ye know--really!Said we were awfully good
friends, ye know, and all that.For Reginald had done much thinking of late--and his creditors were
restless.Hawley-Crowles,
beaming like a full-blown sunflower.Only--ye know, she'll have to be--coached a bit, ye
know--told who we are--our ancestral history, and all that.Why, she just couldn't help loving you!""No--aw--no, of course--that is--aw--she has excellent
prospects--financial, I mean, eh?Mines, and all that, ye know--eh?""Why, she owns the grandest gold mine in all South America!I--aw--I never was so attracted to a girl in all me
blooming life!You will--a--speak to her, eh?"Never fear, Reginald" she's yours.Certainly not--not when she knows about our family.And--aw--mother will talk with you--that is, about the details.She'll
arrange them, ye know.And the haughty mother of the young Duke did call shortly thereafter
to consult in regard to her son's matrimonial desires.The nerve-racking
round of balls, receptions, and other society functions was quite
forgotten by the elated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose ears tingled
deliciously under the pompous boastings of the Dowager Lady Altern.Hawley-Crowles was convinced, after a
half hour's conversation with this proud mother, that the royal house
of Brunswick was but an impudent counterfeit!Reed, who had
hastily appraised it, had said that there was a mountain of gold there,
only awaiting Yankee enterprise.There was proof positive
that she was an Inca princess.Hawley-Crowles was so honored
by the deep interest which the young Duke manifested in the wonderful
girl!And she would undertake negotiations with her at once.Hawley-Crowles had to plan very carefully.She was terribly
in debt; yet she had resources.The Beaubien was inexhaustible.Ames,
too, might be depended upon.And La Libertad--well, there was Mr.Philip O. Ketchim to reckon with.So she forthwith summoned him to a
consultation.But, ere her talk with that prince of finance, another bit of good
fortune fell into the lady's spacious lap.Reed had written that he
was doing poorly with his western mining ventures, and would have to
raise money at once.He therefore offered to sell his interest in the
Simiti Company.Moreover, he wanted his wife to come to him and make
her home in California, where he doubtless would spend some years.Hawley-Crowles offered him twenty-five thousand dollars for his
Simiti interest; of which offer Reed wired his immediate acceptance.Then the lady packed her rueful sister Westward Ho!and laid her newly
acquired stock before the Beaubien for a large loan.That was but a
day before Ketchim called."Madam," said that suave gentleman, smiling piously, "you are a
genius.Our ability to announce the Duke of Altern as our largest
stockholder will result in a boom in the sales of Simiti stock.The
Lord has greatly prospered our humble endeavors.Er--might I ask,
Madam, if you would condescend to meet my wife some afternoon?We are
rapidly acquiring some standing in a financial way, and Mrs.Ketchim
would like to know you and some of the more desirable members of your
set, if it might be arranged."Hawley-Crowles beamed her joy.She drew herself up with a regnant
air.The people were coming to her, their social queen, for
recognition!"And there's my Uncle Ted, you know, Madam.He's president of the C.
and R."Hawley-Crowles nodded and looked wise."Possibly we can arrange
it," she said.What is Joplin
Zinc doing?"The lady wondered, for Joplin Zinc was not yet in operation, according
to the latest report.*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, while Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was still laying her plans to herd
the young girl into the mortgaged dukedom of Altern, Father Waite kept
his appointment, and called at the Beaubien mansion on the afternoon
Carmen had set.He was warmly received by the girl herself, who had
been watching for his coming."Now," she began like a bubbling fountain, when they were seated in
the music room, "where's Jude?Why, I haven't the slightest idea to whom you refer," returned
the puzzled man."The woman who took me to the Sister Superior," explained Carmen."Well," said the girl confidently, "I saw her, but she got away from
me.But I shall find her--it is right that I should.Now tell me, what
are you going to do?"Earn my living some way," he replied meditatively."You have lots of friends who will help you?""I am an apostate, you know.""Well, that means that you're free.The chains have dropped, haven't
they?""You are not dazed, nor confused!Why, you're like a prisoner coming
out of his dungeon into the bright sunlight.You're only blinking,
that's all.And, as for confusion--well, if I would admit it to be
true I could point to a terrible state of it!Just think, a duke wants
to marry me; Mrs.Hawley-Crowles is determined that he shall; I am an
Inca princess, and yet I don't know who I am; my own people apparently
are swallowed up by the war in Colombia; and I am in an environment
here in New York in which I have to fight every moment to keep myself
from flying all to pieces!But I guess God intends to keep me here for
the present.Oh, yes, and Monsignor Lafelle insists that I am a
Catholic and that I must join his Church.""Is Monsignor Lafelle working with
Madam Beaubien, your friend?"Hawley-Crowles--"

"Was it through him that she became a communicant?"Ames's sister, the Dowager Duchess, in England.The young Duke is also
going to join the faith, I learn.He stopped suddenly and
looked searchingly at her.At that moment a maid entered, bearing a card.Close on her heels
followed the subject of their conversation, Monsignor himself.As he entered, Carmen rose hastily to greet him.Then, as he straightened up, his glance fell upon Father Waite.For a moment the two men stood
eying each other sharply.Then Lafelle looked from Father Waite to
Carmen quizzically."I beg your pardon," he said, "I was not aware
that you had a caller.Madam Beaubien, is she at home?"murmured Lafelle, looking significantly from the girl to Father
Waite, while a smile curled his lips.He bowed again, and turned toward the exit.She had caught the
churchman's insinuating glance and instantly read its meaning."Monsignor Lafelle, you will remain!"The churchman's brows arched with surprise, but he came back and stood
by the chair which she indicated."And first," went on the girl, standing before him like an incarnate
Nemesis, her face flushed and her eyes snapping, "you will hear from
me a quotation from the Scripture, on which you assume to be
authority: 'As a man thinketh in his heart, so _is_ he!'"Finally a bland
smile spread over his features, and he sat down."Now, Monsignor Lafelle," she continued severely, "you have urged me
to unite with your Church.When you asked me to subscribe to your
beliefs I looked first at them, and then at you, their product.You
have come here this afternoon to plead with me again.The thoughts
which you accepted when you saw Father Waite here alone with me, are
they a reflection of love, which thinketh no evil?Or do they reflect
the intolerance, the bigotry, the hatred of the carnal mind?You told
me that your Church would not let me teach it.Think you I will let it
or you teach me?"Father Waite sat amazed at the girl's stinging rebuke.When she
concluded he rose to go.You have left the Church
of which Monsignor Lafelle is a part.Either you have done that
Church, and him, a great injustice--or he does ignorant or wilful
wrong in insisting that I unite with it.""My dear child," said Lafelle gently, now recovered and wholly on his
guard, "your impetuosity gets the better of your judgment.This is no
occasion for a theological discussion, nor are you sufficiently
informed to bear a part in such.As for myself, you unintentionally do
me great wrong.As I have repeatedly told you, I seek only your
eternal welfare.Else would I not labor with you as I do.""Is my eternal welfare dependent upon
acceptance of the Church's doctrines?""No," he said, in a scarcely audible voice.A cynical look came into Lafelle's eyes.But he replied affably: "When
preachers fall out, the devil falls in.Waite, comes
quite consistently from one who has impudently tossed aside
authority.""My authority, Monsignor," returned the ex-priest in a low tone, "is
Jesus Christ, who said: 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.'"murmured Lafelle; "then it was love that prompted you to abandon
your little flock?""I left my pulpit, Monsignor, because I had nothing to give my people.I no longer believe the dogmas of the Church.And I refused longer to
take the poor people's money to support an institution so politically
religious as I believe your Church to be.I could no longer take their
money to purchase the release of their loved ones from an imagined
purgatory--a place for which there is not the slightest Scriptural
warrant--"

"You mistake, sir!""Very well, Monsignor," replied Father Waite; "grant, then, that there
is such Scriptural warrant; I would nevertheless know that the
existence of purgatory was wholly incompatible with the reign of an
infinite God of love.And, knowing that, I have ceased to extort gifts
of money from the ignorance of the living and the ghastly terrors of
the dying--"

"And so deceive yourself that you are doing a righteous act in
removing their greatest consolation," the churchman again interrupted,
a sneer curving his lip.The consolation which the stupifying drug affords, yes!Ah, Monsignor, as I looked down into the faces of my poor people, week
after week, I knew that no sacerdotal intervention was needed to remit
their sins, for their sins were but their unsolved problems of life.Oh, the poor, grief-stricken mothers who bent their tear-stained eyes
upon me as I preached the 'authority' of the Fathers!Well I knew
that, when I told them from my pulpit that their deceased infants, if
baptized, went straight to heaven, they blindly, madly accepted my
words!And when I went further and told them that their dead babes had
joined the ranks of the blessed, and could thenceforth be prayed to,
could I wonder that they rejoiced and eagerly grasped the false
message of cheer?They believed because they wanted it to be so.And
yet those utterances of mine, based upon the accepted doctrine of
Holy Church, were but narcotics, lulling those poor, afflicted minds
into a false sense of rest and security, and checking all further
human progress.""It is to be regretted," he said
coldly, "that such narrowness of view should be permitted to impede
the salvation of souls.""Ah, how many souls
have I not saved!--and yet I know not whether they or I be really
saved!From misery,
disease, suffering in this life?Ah, my friend, saved only from the torments of a hell and a purgatory
constructed in the fertile minds of busy theologians!""Some other day, perhaps--when it may be
more convenient for us both--and you are alone--"

Carmen laughed."Don't quit the field, Monsignor--unless you surrender
abjectly.And you were quite
indiscreet, if you will recall.""You write my faults in brass," he gently
lamented."When you publish my virtues, if you find that I am
possessed of any, I fear you will write them in water.""Your virtues should advertise themselves,
Monsignor.""Ah, then do you not see in me the virtue of desiring your welfare
above all else, my child?""And the welfare of this great country, which you have come here to
assist in making dominantly Catholic, is it not so, Monsignor?"Then he smiled genially back at the girl."It is an ambition which I am not ashamed to own," he returned
gently."But, Monsignor," Carmen continued earnestly, "are you not aware of
the inevitable failure of your mission?Do you not know that mediaeval
theology comports not with modern progress?""True, my child," replied the churchman."And more, that our
so-called modern progress--modernism, free-thinking, liberty of
conscience, and the consequent terrible extravagance of beliefs and
false creeds--constitutes the greatest menace now confronting this
fair land."Monsignor," said Carmen, "in the Middle Ages the Church was supreme.Emperors and kings bowed in submission before her.Would you be willing, for the sake of Church
supremacy to-day, to return to the state of society and civilization
then obtaining?"I point you to Mexico, Cuba, the Philippines, South America, all
Catholic now or formerly, and I ask if you attribute not their
oppression, their ignorance, their low morals and stunted manhood, to
the dominance of churchly doctrines, which oppose freedom of
conscience and press and speech, and make learning the privilege of
the clergy and the rich?""It is an old argument, child," deprecated Lafelle."May I not point
to France, on the contrary?""She has all but driven the Church from her borders.""And England, though Anglican,
calls herself Catholic.Germany is
forsaking Luther, as she sees the old light shining still undimmed."The latter read in her glance an
invitation further to voice his own convictions."Monsignor doubtless misreads the signs of the times," he said slowly."The hour has struck for the ancient and materialistic theories
enunciated with such assumption of authority by ignorant, often
blindly bigoted theologians, to be laid aside.The religion of our
fathers, which is our present-day evangelical theology, was derived
from the traditions of the early churchmen.They put their seal upon
it; and we blindly accept it as authority, despite the glaring,
irrefutable fact that it is utterly undemonstrable.Why do the people
continue to be deceived by it?only because of its mesmeric
promise of immortality beyond the grave."Monsignor bowed stiffly in the direction of Father Waite."Fortunately,
your willingness to plunge the Christian world into chaos will fail of
concrete results," he said coldly."I but voice the sentiments of millions, Monsignor.For them, too, the
time has come to put by forever the paraphernalia of images, candles,
and all the trinkets used in the pagan ceremonial which has so
quenched our spirituality, and to seek the undivided garment of the
Christ.""The world to-day, Monsignor, stands at the door of a new era, an era
which promises a grander concept of God and religion, the tie which
binds all to Him, than has ever before been known.And we are at
last beginning to work with true scientific precision and system.As
in chemistry, mathematics, and the physical sciences, so in matters
religious, we are beginning to _prove_ our working hypotheses.And so
a new spiritual enlightenment is come.People are awaking to a dim
perception of the meaning of spiritual life, as exemplified in Jesus
Christ.And they are vaguely beginning to see that it is possible to
every one.The abandonment of superstition, religious and other, has
resulted in such a sudden expansion of the human mind that the most
marvelous material progress the world has ever witnessed has come
swiftly upon us, and we live more intensely in a single hour to-day
than our fathers lived in weeks before us.Oh, yes, we are already
growing tired of materiality.But, Monsignor, let not the Church boast itself that the
acceptance of her mediaeval dogmas will meet the world's great need.That need will be met, I think, only as we more and more clearly
perceive the tremendous import of the mission of Jesus, and learn how
to grasp and apply the marvelous Christ-principle which he used and
told us we should likewise employ to work out our salvation."During Father Waite's earnest talk Lafelle sat with his eyes fixed
upon Carmen.When the ex-priest concluded, the churchman ignored him
and vouchsafed no reply.said the girl, after waiting some moments in
expectation.Then, nodding his shapely head, he said in
a pleading tone:

"Have I no champion here?Would you, too, suddenly abolish the Church,
Catholic and Protestant alike?Why, my dear child, with your
ideals--which no one appreciates more highly than I--do you continue
to persecute me so cruelly?Can not you, too, sense the unsoundness of
the views just now so eloquently voiced?"You speak wholly without authority or proof,
as is your wont.""Well," he said, "there are several hundred
million Catholics and Protestants in the world to-day.Would you
presume to say that they are all mistaken, and that you are right?Indeed, I think you set the
Church an example in that respect.""Monsignor, there were once several hundred millions who believed that
the earth was flat, and that the sun revolved about it.But the--"

"And, Monsignor, there are billions to-day who believe that matter is
a solid, substantial reality, and that it possesses life and
sensation.There are billions who believe that the physical eyes see,
and the ears hear, and the hands feel.Yet these beliefs are all
capable of scientific refutation."I am not unacquainted with philosophical speculation," he returned
suggestively."This is not mere speculation, Monsignor," put in Father Waite."The
beliefs of the human mind are its fetish.Such beliefs become in time
national customs, and men defend them with frenzy, utterly wrong and
undemonstrable though they be.Then they remain as the incubus of true
progress.By them understanding becomes degraded, and the human mind
narrows and shrinks.And the mind that clings to them will then
mercilessly hunt out the dissenting minds of its heretical neighbors
and stone them to death for disagreeing.So now, you would stone me
for obeying Christ's command to take up my bed on the Sabbath day.""Still you blazon my faults," he said in
a tone of mock sadness, and addressing Carmen."But, like the Church
which you persecute, I shall endure.We have been martyred throughout
the ages.Our wayward children forsake us,"
nodding toward Father Waite, "and yet we welcome their return when
they have tired of the husks.The press teems with slander against us;
we are reviled from east to west.But our reply is that such slander
and untruth can best be met by our leading individual lives of such an
exemplary nature as to cause all men to be attracted by our holy
light.""I agree with you, Monsignor," quickly replied Carmen."Scurrilous
attacks upon the Church but make it a martyr.Vilification returns
upon the one who hurls the abuse.One can not fling mud without
soiling one's hands.I oppose not men, but human systems of thought.Whatever is good will stand, and needs no defense.And there is no excuse, for salvation is at hand.""_Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts_,"
she replied earnestly."_To him that soweth righteousness_--right
thinking--_shall be a sure reward_.Ah, Monsignor, do you at heart
believe that the religion of the Christ depends upon doctrines, signs,
dogmas?But signs and proofs naturally and inevitably
follow the right understanding of Jesus' teachings, even according to
these words: _These signs shall follow them that believe_.Paul gave the
formula for salvation, when he said: _But we all with open face beholding
as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord_.Can you see that, taking Jesus as our model and
following his every command--seeing Him only, the Christ-principle, which
is God, good, without any admixture of evil--we change, even though
slowly, from glory to glory, step by step, until we rise out of all
sense of evil and death?And this is done by the Spirit which is God.""Yes," said Father Waite, taking up the conversation when she paused."Even the poorest human being can understand that.Why, then, the
fungus growth of traditions, ceremonies, rites and forms which have
sprung up about the Master's simple words?Why the wretched
formalistic worship throughout the world?Why the Church's frigid,
lifeless traditions, so inconsistent with the enlarging sense of God
which marks this latest century?The Church has yet to prove its
utility, its right to exist and to pose as the religious teacher of
mankind.Else must it fall beneath the axe which is even now at the
root of the barren tree of theology.Her theology, like the Judaism of
the Master's day, has no prophets, no poets, no singers.And her
priests, as in his time, have sunk into a fanatical observance of
ritual and form.""And yet," observed Carmen, "you still urge me to unite with it."Moreover, it irked him sore to be made a
target for the unassailable logic of the apostate Waite.Then, too,
the appearance of the ex-priest there that afternoon in company with
this girl who held such radical views regarding religious matters
portended in his thought the possibility of a united assault upon the
foundations of his cherished system.She
nettled and exasperated him.Did he
have the power to silence her?he asked, with a show of gaiety."Yes," replied Carmen, "you may go now."He, Monsignor, a dignitary of
Holy Church?He turned upon the girl and her
companion, furious with anger."I have been very patient with you both," he said in a voice that he
could not control.Abuse the Church
as you will, the fact remains that the world fears her and trembles
before her awful voice!Because the world recognizes her mighty
power, a power of unified millions of human beings and exhaustless
wealth.She is the leader, the guide, the teacher, the supreme object
of worship of a countless army who would lay down their lives to-day
for her.Her subjects gather from every quarter of the globe.They are
English, French, German, American--_but they are Catholics first_!Emperor, King, Ruler, or Government--all are alike subject to her
supreme, divine authority!Nationalities, customs, family ties--all
melt away before her, to whom her followers bow in loyal consecration.The power which her supreme leader and head wields is all but
omnipotent!He is by divine decree Lord of the world.Hundreds of
millions bend before his throne and offer him their hearts and swords!I say, you have good reason to quake!The onward march of Holy Church is not disturbed by the croaking
calumnies of such as you who would assault her!And to you I say,
beware!"His face was purple, as he stopped and mopped his damp brow."What we have to beware of, Monsignor," said Father Waite gravely, "is
the steady encroachments of Rome in this country, with her weapons of
fear, ignorance, and intolerance--"

"Intolerance!Why, in this country, whose
Constitution provided toleration for every form of religion--"

Carmen had risen and gone to the man."Monsignor," she said, "the
founders of the American nation did provide for religious tolerance--and
they were wise according to their light.But we of this day are
still wiser, for we have some knowledge of the wonderful working of
mental laws.I, too, believe in toleration of opinion.You are
welcome to yours, and I to mine.But--and here is the great point--the
opinion which Holy Church has held throughout the ages regarding those
who do not accept her dogmas is that they are damned, that they are
outcasts of heaven, that they merit the stake and rack.The Church's
hatred of heretics has been deadly.Her thought concerning them has
not been that of love, such as Jesus sent out to all who did not
agree with him, but deadly, suggestive hatred.Now our Constitution
does not provide for tolerance of hate and murder-thoughts, which enter
the minds of the unsuspecting and work destruction there in the form
of disease, disaster, and death.That is what we object to in you,
Monsignor.And toward such thoughts we have a right to be very intolerant, even to
the point of destroying them in human mentalities.Again I say, I war
not against people, but against the murderous carnal thought of the
human mind!"Monsignor had fallen back before the girl's strong words.His face
had grown black, and his hands were working convulsively."Monsignor," continued Carmen in a low, steady voice, "you have
threatened me with something which you apparently hold over me.You
are very like the people of Galilee: if you can not refute by reason,
you would circumvent by law, by the Constitution, by Congress.Instead of threatening us with the flames
of hell for not being good, why do you not show us by the great
example of Jesus' love how to be so?Are you manifesting love now--or
the carnal mind?I judge your Church by such as manifest it to me.How, then, shall I judge it by you to-day?"He rose slowly and took her by the hand."I beg your pardon," he said
in a strange, unnatural voice.And I assure you that you quite
misunderstand me, and the Church which I represent."Surely, Monsignor," returned the girl heartily."A debate such as
this is stimulating, don't you think so?""Ah, Monsignor," she said lightly, as she stepped into the room.Why have you avoided me since your return to America?""Madam," replied Lafelle, in some confusion, "no one regrets more than
I the press of business which necessitated it.But your little friend
has told me I may return.""Always welcome, Monsignor," replied the Beaubien, scanning him
narrowly as she accompanied him to the door."By the way, you forgot
our little compact, did you not?""Madam, I came out of a sense of duty.""Of that I have no doubt, Monsignor.She returned again to the music room, where Carmen made her acquainted
with Father Waite, and related the conversation with Lafelle.While
the girl talked the Beaubien's expression grew serious.Then Carmen
launched into her association with the ex-priest, concluding with:
"And he must have something to do, right away, to earn his living!"She always did when Carmen, no matter how
serious the conversation, infused her sparkling animation into it."That isn't nearly as important as to know what he thinks about
Monsignor's errand here this afternoon, dearie," she said."Madam," he said with great seriousness, "I would
be very wide awake."The Beaubien studied him for a moment."I think--I think--" He hesitated, and looked at Carmen."I think he--has been greatly angered by--this girl--and by my
presence here."Then abruptly: "What are you going to do
now?""I have funds enough to keep me some weeks, Madam, while making plans
for the future.""Then remain where I can keep in touch with you."For the Beaubien had just returned from a two hours' ride with J.
Wilton Ames, and she felt that she needed a friend.CHAPTER 20


The Beaubien sat in the rounded window of the breakfast room.Carmen
nestled at her feet.The maid had just removed the remains of the
light luncheon."Dearest, please, _please_ don't look so serious!"The Beaubien twined her fingers through the girl's flowing locks."I
will try, girlie," she said, though her voice broke.Carmen looked up into her face with a wistful yearning."Ever since Monsignor Lafelle and Father Waite
were here you have been so quiet; and that was nearly a week ago.I
know I can help, if you will only let me.""By knowing that God is everywhere, and that evil is unreal and
powerless," came the quick, invariable reply.Why, if I were chained to a stake, with fire all around me, I'd
know it wasn't true!""I think you are chained--and the fire has been kindled," said the
woman in a voice that fell to a whisper."Then your thought is wrong--all wrong!And wrong thought just _can't_
be externalized to me, for I know that 'There shall no mischief happen
to the righteous,' that is, to the right-thinking.The Beaubien got up and walked slowly around
the room, as if to summon her strength."I'm going to tell you," she said firmly."You are right, and I have
been wrong.I--I
have lost a great deal of money."I have discovered in the past few months that there are better
things in life.But--" her lips tightened, and her eyes half
closed--"he can _not_ have you!"Listen, child: I know not why it is, but you awaken something in
every life into which you come.The woman I was a year ago and the
woman I am to-day meet almost as strangers now.The only answer I
can give is, you.I don't know what you did to people in South
America; I can only surmise.Yet of this I am certain, wherever you
went you made a path of light.But the effect you have on people
differs with differing natures.Just why this is, I do not know.It
must have something to do with those mental laws of which I am so
ignorant, and of which you know so much."Carmen looked at her in wondering anticipation.The Beaubien smiled
down into the face upturned so lovingly, and went on:

"From what you have told me about your priest, Jose, I know that you
were the light of his life.He loved you to the complete obliteration
of every other interest.You have not said so; but I know it.How,
indeed, could it be otherwise?On the other hand, that heartless
Diego--his mad desire to get possession of you was only animal.Why
should you, a child of heaven, arouse such opposite sentiments?""Dearest," said the girl, laying her head on the woman's knees, "that
isn't what's worrying you.""No--but I think of it so often.And, as for me, you have turned me
inside-out.""Well, I think this side wears better,
don't you?""It is softer--it may not," returned the woman gently."But I have no
desire to change back."Ames
and I have been--no, not friends.I had no higher ideals than he, and
I played his game with him.And at a time when he had
involved me heavily financially.The Colombian revolution--his cotton
deal--he must have foreseen, he is so uncanny--he must have known that
to involve me meant control whenever he might need me!He needs me
now, for I stand between him and you.""God stands between me and every
form of evil!"She sat down on the arm of the Beaubien's chair."Is it
because you will not let him have me that he threatens to ruin you
financially?"He couldn't ruin me in reputation, for--" her voice again faded
to a whisper, "I haven't any."cried the girl, throwing her arms about the
woman's neck."Your true self is just coming to light!The Beaubien suddenly burst into a flood of tears.The strain of weeks
was at last manifesting."Oh, I have been in the gutter!--he dragged
me through the mire!--and I let him!I schemed and plotted with him; I ruined and pillaged
with him; I murdered reputations and blasted lives with him, that I
might get money, dirty, blood-stained money!Oh, Carmen, I didn't know
what I was doing, until you came!And now I'd hang on the cross if I
could undo it!And he has you and me in his
clutches, and he is crushing us!"She bent her head and sobbed
violently."Be still, and _know_ that I am
God."The Beaubien raised her head and smiled feebly through her
tears."He governs all, dearest," whispered Carmen, as she drew the woman's
head to her breast.cried the Beaubien, starting up.No, we will stay and meet them, right here!"The Beaubien's hand shook as she clasped Carmen's."I can't turn to
Kane, nor to Fitch, nor Weston.I've
ruined Gannette myself--for him!Hawley-Crowles--"

"Mrs.sobbed the suffering woman, clinging to the girl."I lent her money--took her notes--which I sold again to Mr."Well, you can buy them back, can't you?"Most that I have is mortgaged to him on the investments I made at his
direction," wailed the woman."I will try--I am trying, desperately!But--there is Monsignor Lafelle!"And I'm sure he holds something over
you and me.But, I will send for him--I will renew my vows to his
Church--anything to--"

"Listen, dearest," interrupted Carmen.If I am the cause of it all, I can--"

"You will not!"The desperate woman put her head in the girl's lap and sobbed
bitterly."There is a way out, dearest," whispered Carmen."I _know_ there is,
no matter what seems to be or to happen, for 'underneath are the
everlasting arms.'Hawley-Crowles told me this
morning that Mrs.Ames intends to give a big reception next week.And--it will be right, I
know."And Carmen sat with the repentant woman all that day, struggling with
her to close the door upon her sordid past, and to open it wide to
"that which is to come."*       *       *       *       *

The days following were busy ones for many with whom our story is
concerned.Every morning saw Carmen on her way to the Beaubien, to
comfort and advise.Every afternoon found her yielding gently to the
relentless demands of society, or to the tiresome calls of her
thoroughly ardent wooer, the young Duke of Altern.Carmen would have
helped him if she could.But she found so little upon which to build.And she bore with him largely on account of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, for
whom she and the Beaubien were now daily laboring.The young man
tacitly assumed proprietorship over the girl, and all society was agog
with expectation of the public announcement of their engagement.Hawley-Crowles still came and went upon a tide of unruffled joy.The cornucopia of Fortune lay full at her feet.Her broker, Ketchim,
basked in the sunlight of her golden smiles--and quietly sold his own
Simiti stock on the strength of her patronage.Society fawned and
smirked at her approach, and envied her brilliant success, as it
copied the cut of her elaborate gowns--all but the deposed Mrs.Ames
and her unlovely daughter, who sulked and hated, until they received a
call from Monsignor Lafelle.This was shortly after that gentleman's
meeting with Carmen and Father Waite in the Beaubien mansion.And he
left the Ames home with an ominous look on his face."The girl is a
menace," he muttered, "and she deserves her fate."The Ames grand reception, promising to be the most brilliant event of
the year, barring the famous _Bal de l'Opera_, was set for Thursday.Hawley-Crowles nor Carmen had received invitations.To the former it was evident that there was some mistake."For it
can't be possible that the hussy doesn't intend to invite us!"Hawley-Crowles
drenched with tears of anxiety and vexation."I'd call her up and ask,
if I dared," she groaned.And, to the
amazement of the exclusive set, the brilliant function was held
without the presence of its acknowledged leaders, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
and her ward, the Inca princess.*       *       *       *       *

On Wednesday night Harris arrived from Denver.His arrival was
instantly made known to J. Wilton Ames, who, on the morning following,
summoned both him and Philip O. Ketchim to his private office.There
were present, also, Monsignor Lafelle and Alonzo Hood.The latter was observed to change color as he
timidly entered the room and faced the waiting audience."Be seated, gentlemen," said Ames genially, after cordially shaking
hands with them and introducing the churchman.Then, turning to
Harris, "You are on your way to Colombia, I learn.Going down to
inaugurate work on the Simiti holdings, I suppose?"Harris threw a quick glance at Ketchim.The latter sat blank,
wondering if there were any portions of the earth to which Ames's long
arms did not reach."As a matter of fact," Ames continued, leaning back in his chair and
pressing the tips of his fingers together before him, "a hitch seems
to have developed in Simiti proceedings.Ketchim," turning suddenly and sharply upon that gentleman, "because
my brokers have picked up for me several thousand shares of the
stock.""But," proceeded Ames calmly, "now that I have put money into it, I
learn that the Simiti Company has no property whatever in Colombia."A haze slowly gathered before Ketchim's eyes."How do you make that out, Mr.he
heard Harris say in a voice that seemed to come from an infinite
distance."I myself saw the title papers which old Rosendo had, and
saw them transferred to Mr.Moreover,
I personally visited the mine in question."The
property was relocated by this Rosendo, and he secured title to it
under the name of the Chicago mine.It was that name which deceived
the clerks in the Department of Mines in Cartagena, and caused them to
issue title, not knowing that it really was the famous old La
Libertad.""Well, I don't see that there is any ground for confusion.""Simply this," returned Ames evenly: "La Libertad mine, since the
death of its former owner, Don Ignacio de Rincon, has belonged to the
Church.""By what right does it belong to the
Church?""By the ancient law of _'en manos muertas'_, my friend," replied Ames,
unperturbed."Our friend, Monsignor Lafelle, representing the Church, will
explain," said Ames, waving a hand toward that gentleman."I deeply regret this unfortunate
situation, gentlemen," he began.Ames has pointed out,
the confusion came about through issuing title to the mine under the
name Chicago.Don Ignacio de Rincon, long before his departure from
Colombia after the War of Independence, drew up his last will, and,
following the established custom among wealthy South Americans of that
day, bequeathed this mine, La Libertad, and other property, to the
Church, invoking the old law of _'en manos muertas'_ which, being
translated, means, 'in dead hands.'Pious Catholics of many lands have
done the same throughout the centuries.Such a bequest places property
in the custody of the Church; and it may never be sold or disposed of
in any way, but all revenue from it must be devoted to the purchase of
Masses for the souls in purgatory.It was through the merest chance, I
assure you, that your mistake was brought to light.Ames, had purchased stock in your company, I took the
pains to investigate while in Cartagena recently, and made the
discovery which unfortunately renders your claim to the mine quite
null."turning savagely
upon the paralyzed Ketchim."That," interposed Ames with cruel significance, "is a matter which he
will explain in court."Fleeting visions of the large blocks of stock which he had sold; of
the widows, orphans, and indigent clergymen whom he had involved; of
the notes which the banks held against him; of his questionable deals
with Mrs.Hawley-Crowles; and of the promiscuous peddling of his own
holdings in the now ruined company, rushed over the clouded mind of
this young genius of high finance.His tongue froze, though his
trembling body dripped with perspiration.Somehow he found the door, and groped his way to a descending
elevator.And somehow he lived through that terror-haunted day and
night.But very early next morning, while his blurred eyes were drinking in
the startling report of the Simiti Company's collapse, as set forth in
the newspaper which he clutched in his shaking hand, the maid led in a
soft-stepping gentleman, who laid a hand upon his quaking shoulder and
read to him from a familiar-looking document an irresistible
invitation to take up lodgings in the city jail.*       *       *       *       *

There were other events forward at the same time, which came to light
that fateful next day.Hawley-Crowles, after a
night of mingled worry and anger over the deliberate or unintentional
exclusion of herself and Carmen from the Ames reception the preceding
night, descended to her combined breakfast and luncheon.At her plate
lay the morning mail, including a letter from France.She tore it
open, hastily scanned it, then dropped with a gasp into her chair."Father--married to--a French--adventuress!The long-cherished hope of a speedy inheritance of his snug fortune
lay blasted at her feet.The telephone bell rang sharply, and she rose dully to answer it.The
call came from the city editor of one of the great dailies."It is
reported," said the voice, "that your ward, Miss Carmen Ariza, is the
illegitimate daughter of a <DW64> priest, now in South America.We
would like your denial, for we learn that it was for this reason that
you and the young lady were not included among the guests at the Ames
reception last evening."Hawley-Crowles's legs tottered under her, as she blindly wandered
from the telephone without replying.Carmen--the daughter of a priest!Her father a <DW64>--her mother, what?The stunned woman mechanically took up the morning paper which lay on
the table.Her glance was at once attracted to the great headlines
announcing the complete exposure of the Simiti bubble.Her eyes nearly
burst from her head as she grasped its fatal meaning to her.With a
low, inarticulate sound issuing from her throat, she turned and groped
her way back to her boudoir.*       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, the automobile in which Carmen was speeding to the
Beaubien mansion was approached by a bright, smiling young woman, as
it halted for a moment at a street corner.Carmen recognized her as
a reporter for one of the evening papers, who had called often at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion that season for society items."I was on my way
to see you.Our office received a report this morning from some source
that your father--you know, there has been some mystery about your
parentage--that he was really a priest, of South America.His
name--let me think--what did they say it was?"The problem
of her descent had really become a source of amusement to her."It began with a D, if I am not mistaken.I'm not up on Spanish
names," the young woman returned pleasantly."Well, I'm sure I can't say."But--you think it was, don't you?""Well, I don't believe it was Padre Diego--he wasn't a good man."I was in his house, in Banco.He used to insist that I
was his child."By the way, you knew a woman named Jude, didn't you?But she took you out of a house down on--"

"Yes.And I've tried to find her ever since.""You know Father Waite, too, the ex-priest?""You and he going to work together, I suppose?""Why, I'm sure I don't know.You think this Diego might
have been your father?That is, you can't say positively that he
wasn't?"You can come up to the
house and talk about South America, if you want to."She nodded pleasantly, and the car moved away.The innocent, ingenuous
girl was soon to learn what modern news-gathering and dissemination
means in this great Republic.But she rode on, happy in the thought
that she and the Beaubien were formulating plans to save Mrs."We'll arrange it somehow," said the Beaubien, looking up from her
papers when Carmen entered."Go, dearie, and play the organ while I
finish this.Then I will return home with you to have a talk with Mrs.For hours the happy girl lingered at the beloved organ.The Beaubien
at her desk below stopped often to listen.And often she would hastily
brush away the tears, and plunge again into her papers."I suppose I
should have told Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," she said."But I couldn't give
her any hope.And yet," she reflected
sadly, "who would believe _me_?"The morning papers lay still unread
upon her table.Late in the afternoon the Beaubien with Carmen entered her car and
directed the chauffeur to drive to the Hawley-Crowles home.As they
entered a main thoroughfare they heard the newsboys excitedly crying
extras.Of a sudden a vague, unformed presentiment of impending evil came to
the girl.She half rose, and clutched the Beaubien's hand.Then there
flitted through her mind like a beam of light the words of the
psalmist: "A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee."She sank back against
the Beaubien's shoulder and closed her eyes.Presently the chauffeur turned and said something
through the speaking tube.cried the Beaubien, springing from the seat.A loud cry escaped her as she took the sheet and glanced at the
startling headlines.James Hawley-Crowles, financially ruined,
and hurled to disgrace from the pinnacle of social leadership by the
awful exposure of the parentage of her ward, had been found in her
bedroom, dead, with a revolver clasped in her cold hand.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The chill winds of another autumn swirled through the masonry-lined
canons of the metropolis and sighed among the stark trees of its
deserted parks.They caught up the tinted leaves that dropped from
quivering branches and tossed them high, as Fate wantons with human
hopes before she blows her icy breath upon them.They shrieked among
the naked spars of the _Cossack_, drifting with her restless master
far out upon the white-capped waves.They moaned in low-toned agony
among the marble pillars of the Crowles mausoleum, where lay in
pitying sleep the misguided woman whose gods of gold and tinsel had
betrayed her.On the outskirts of the Bronx, in a newly opened suburb, a slender
girl, with books and papers under her arm, walked slowly against the
sharp wind, holding her hat with her free hand, and talking rapidly to
a young man who accompanied her.Toward them came an old <DW64>,
leaning upon a cane.As he stepped humbly aside to make room, the girl
looked up.Then, without stopping, she slipped a few coins into his
coat pocket as she passed.The <DW64> stood in dumb amazement.He was poor--his clothes were thin
and worn--but he was not a beggar--he had asked nothing.The girl
turned and threw back a smile to him.Then of a sudden there came into
the old man's wrinkled, care-lined face such a look, such a
comprehension of that love which knows neither Jew nor Gentile, Greek
nor Barbarian, as would have caused even the Rabbis, at the cost of
defilement, to pause and seek its heavenly meaning.A few blocks farther on the strong wind sternly disputed the girl's
right to proceed, and she turned with a merry laugh to her companion.But as she stood, the wind fell, leaving a heap of dead leaves about
her feet.She stooped and
took up a two-dollar bill.Her companion threw her a wondering look; but the girl made no
comment.In silence they went on, until a few minutes more of brisk
walking brought them to a newly built, stucco-coated bungalow.Running
rapidly up the steps, the girl threw wide the door and called, "Mother
dear!"The Beaubien rose from her sewing to receive the hearty embrace.she said, devouring the sparkling creature with eager
eyes.Lewis begins his law course at once, and I may take
what I wish.Hitt's coming to call to-night and bring a
friend, a Mr.The Beaubien drew the girl to her and kissed her again and again.Then
she glanced over her shoulder at the man with a bantering twinkle in
her eyes and said, "Don't you wish you could do that?"Yes he can, too, mother," asserted the girl."I'm afraid it wouldn't look well," he said."And, besides, I don't dare lose my heart to her."With a final squeeze the girl tore herself from the Beaubien's
reluctant arms and hurried to the little kitchen."What is it
to-night, Jude?"she demanded, catching the domestic in a vigorous
embrace."Well, then, liver and bacon, with floating island," she whispered,
very mysteriously.Returning to the little parlor, Carmen encountered the fixed gaze of
both the Beaubien and Father Waite.she demanded, stopping and
looking from one to the other.said the Beaubien, in a tone of mock
severity."Oh," laughed the girl, running to the woman and seating herself in
the waiting lap, "he told, didn't he?Can't I ever trust you with a
secret?"in a tone of rebuke, turning to the man."Surely," he replied, laughing; "and I should not have divulged
this had I not seen in the incident something more than mere
chance--something meant for us all.""I--I think I have seen the working of a
stupendous mental law--am I not right?""You saw
a need, and met it, unsolicited.You found your own in another's
good."The girl smiled at the Beaubien without replying."What about it,
dearie?""She need not answer," said Father Waite, "for we know.She but cast
her bread upon the unfathomable ocean of love, and it returned to her,
wondrously enriched.""If you are going to talk about me, I shall not stay," declared
Carmen, rising.And she departed for the
kitchen, but not without leaving a smile for each of them as she went.The Beaubien and Father Waite remained some moments in silence."She is the light that is
guiding me.This little incident which you have just related is but a
manifestation of the law of love by which she lives.She gave,
unasked, and with no desire to be seen and advertised.There was no chance, no
miracle, no luck about it.It was--it
was--only the working of her beloved Christ-principle.if
we only knew--"

"We _shall_ know, Madam!""Her secret is
but the secret of Jesus himself, which was open to a world too dull to
comprehend.And," his eyes brightening, "to
that end I have been formulating a great plan.That's why I've asked
Hitt to come here to-night.Remember, my
dear friend, we are true searchers; and 'all things work together for
good to them that love God.'Our love of truth and real good is so
great that, like the consuming desire of the Jewish nation, it is
_bound_ to bring the Christ!"*       *       *       *       *

For three months the Beaubien and Carmen had dwelt together in this
lowly environment; and here they had found peace, the first that the
tired woman had known since childhood.The sudden culmination of those
mental forces which had ejected Carmen from society, crushed Ketchim
and a score of others, and brought the deluded Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to
a bitter end, had left the Beaubien with dulled sensibilities.Even
Ames himself had been shocked into momentary abandonment of his
relentless pursuit of humanity by the unanticipated _denouement_.But
when he had sufficiently digested the newspaper accounts wherein were
set forth in unsparing detail the base rumors of the girl's parentage
and of her removal from a brothel before her sudden elevation to
social heights, he rose in terrible wrath and prepared to hunt down to
the death the perpetrators of the foul calumny.Whence had come this
tale, which even the girl could not refute?He had
sailed for Europe--though but a day before.The man was
cringing like a craven murderer in his cell, for none dared give him
bail.Was it revenge for his own sharp move in regard to
La Libertad?He would have given all he possessed to lay his heavy
hands upon the guilty ones!The editors of the great newspapers,
perhaps?Ames raged like a wounded lion in the office of every editor
in the city.But they were perfectly safe, for the girl, although she
told a straightforward story, could not say positively that the
published statements concerning her were false.Yet, though few knew
it, there were two city editors and several reporters who, in the days
immediately following, found it convenient to resign their positions
and leave the city before the awful wrath of the powerful man.And, after weeks of terror, that
browbeaten woman, her hair whitening under the terrible persecution of
her relentless master, fled secretly, with her terrified daughter, to
England, whither the stupified Duke of Altern and his scandalized
mother had betaken themselves immediately following the expose.Thereupon Ames's lawyer drew up a bill of divorce, alleging desertion,
and laid it before the judge who fed from his master's hand.Meantime, the devouring wrath of Ames swept like a prairie fire over the
dry, withering stalks of the smart set.He vowed he would take Carmen
and flaunt her in the faces of the miserable character-assassins who
had sought her ruin!He swore he would support her with his untold
millions and force society to acknowledge her its queen!He had it
in his power to wreck the husband of every arrogant, supercilious
dame in the entire clique!He commenced at once with the unfortunate
Gannette.The latter, already tottering, soon fell before the subtle
machinations of Hodson and his able cohorts.Then, as a telling example
to the rest, Ames pursued him to the doors of the Lunacy Commission,
and rested not until that body had condemned his victim to a living
death in a state asylum.Kane, Fitch, and Weston fled to cover, and
concentrated their guns upon their common enemy.The Beaubien alone
stood out against him for three months.Her existence was death in
life; but from the hour that she first read the newspaper intelligence
regarding Carmen and the unfortunate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, she hid the
girl so completely that Ames was effectually balked in his attempts at
drastic vindication in her behalf.But this served only to intensify his anger, and he thereupon turned
its full force upon the lone woman.Driven to desperation, she stood
at length at bay and hurled at him her remaining weapon.Again the
social set was rent, and this time by the report that the black cloud
of bigamy hung over Ames.It was a fat season for the newspapers, and
they made the most of it.As a result, several of them found
themselves with libel suits on their hands.The Beaubien herself was
confronted with a suit for defamation of character, and was obliged to
testify before the judge whom Ames owned outright that she had but the
latter's word for the charge, and that, years since, in a moment of
maudlin sentimentalism, he had confessed to her that, as far as he
knew, the wife of his youth was still living.Ames then took his heavy toll, and retired within himself to sulk
and plan future assaults and reprisals.The Beaubien, crushed, broken, sick at heart, gathered up the scant
remains of her once large fortune, disposed of her effects, and
withdrew to the outskirts of the city.She would have left the
country, but for the fact that the tangled state of her finances
necessitated her constant presence in New York while her lawyers
strove to bring order out of chaos and placate her raging persecutor.To flee meant complete abandonment of her every financial resource to
Ames.And so, with the assistance of Father Waite and Elizabeth Wall,
who placed themselves at once under her command, she took a little
house, far from the scenes of her troubles, and quietly removed
thither with Carmen.One day shortly thereafter a woman knocked timidly at her door.Carmen
saw the caller and fled into her arms.The woman had come to return the string of pearls which the girl had
thrust into her hands on the night of the Charity Ball.She had not been able to bring herself to sell them.She
had wanted--oh, she knew not what, excepting that she wanted to see
again the girl whose image had haunted her since that eventful night
when the strange child had wandered into her abandoned life.Yes, she
would have given her testimony as to Carmen; but who would have
believed her, a prostitute?And--but the radiant girl gathered her in
her arms and would not let her go without a promise to return.And each time there was a change in
her.The Beaubien always forced upon her a little money and a promise
to come back.It developed that Jude was cooking in a cheap down-town
restaurant."Why not for us, mother, if she will?"And, though the sin-stained woman demurred and protested her
unworthiness, yet the love that knew no evil drew her irresistibly,
and she yielded at length, with her heart bursting.Then, in her great joy, Carmen's glad cry echoed through the little
house: "Oh, mother dear, we're free, we're free!"But the Beaubien was not free.Night after night her sleepless pillow
was wet with bitter tears of remorse, when the accusing angel stood
before her and relentlessly revealed each act of shameful meanness, of
cruel selfishness, of sordid immorality in her wasted life.And,
lastly, the weight of her awful guilt in bringing about the
destruction of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles lay upon her soul like a mountain.Oh, if she had only foreseen even a little of it!Oh, that Carmen had
come to her before--or not at all!And yet she could not wish that she
had never known the girl.The day of judgment was bound
to come.And, but for the comforting presence of
that sweet child, she had long since become a raving maniac.It was
Carmen who, in those first long nights of gnawing, corroding remorse,
wound her soft arms about the Beaubien's neck, as she lay tossing in
mental agony on her bed, and whispered the assurances of that infinite
Love which said, "Behold, I make all things new!"It was Carmen who
whispered to her of the everlasting arms beneath, and of the mercy
reflected by him who, though on the cross, forgave mankind because of
their pitiable ignorance.It is ignorance, always ignorance of what
constitutes real good, that makes men seek it through wrong channels.The Beaubien had sought good--all the world does--but she had never
known that God alone is good, and that men cannot find it until they
reflect Him.And so she had "missed the mark."Oh, sinful, mesmerized
world, ye shall find Me--the true good--only when ye seek Me with all
your heart!And yet, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins."Only a God who is love could voice such a promise!And Carmen knew;
and she hourly poured her great understanding of love into the empty
heart of the stricken Beaubien.Then at last came days of quiet, and planning for the future.The
Beaubien would live--yes, but not for herself.Nay, that life had gone
out forever, nor would mention of it pass her lips again.The
Colombian revolution--her mendacious connivances with Ames--her
sinful, impenitent life of gilded vice--aye, the door was now closed
against that, absolutely and forever more.She had passed through the
throes of a new birth; she had risen again from the bed of anguish;
but she rose stripped of her worldly strength.Carmen was now the
staff upon which she leaned.And Carmen--what had been her thought when foul calumny laid its sooty
touch upon her?What had been the working of her mind when that world
which she had sought to illumine with the light of her own purity had
cast her out?When the blow fell the portals of her mind closed at once against
every accusing thought, against every insidious suggestion of defeat,
of loss, of dishonor.The arrows of malice, as well as those of
self-pity and condemnation, snapped and fell, one by one, as they
hurtled vainly against the whole armor of God wherewith the girl stood
clad.Self sank into service; and she gathered the bewildered,
suffering Beaubien into her arms as if she had been a child.She would
have gone to Ames, too, had she been permitted--not to plead for
mercy, but to offer the tender consolation and support which, despite
the havoc he was committing, she knew he needed even more than the
Beaubien herself."Paul had been a murderer," she often said, as she sat in the darkness
alone with the suffering woman and held her trembling hand."But he
became the chief of apostles.When the light came, he
shut the door against the past.If he hadn't, dearest, he never could
have done what he did.Ames, will have to do the
same."And this the Beaubien could do, and did, after months of
soul-racking struggle.But Ames sat in spiritual darkness, whipped by
the foul brood of lust and revenge, knowing not that the mountainous
wrath which he hourly heaped higher would some day fall, and bury him
fathoms deep.Throughout the crisis Father Waite had stood by them stanchly."I've just longed for some reasonable
excuse to become a social outcast," the latter had said, as she was
helping Carmen one day to pack her effects prior to removing from the
Hawley-Crowles mansion."I long for a hearthstone to which I can
attach myself--"

"Then attach yourself to ours!""For I know that now you are really
going to live--and I want to live as you will.Moreover--" She paused
and smiled queerly at the girl--"I am quite in love with your hero,
Father Waite, you know."Harris, too, made a brief call before departing again for Denver."I've got to hustle for a living now," he explained, "and it's me for
the mountains once more!New York is no place for such a tender lamb
as I. Oh, I've been well trimmed--but I know enough now to keep away
from this burg!"While he was yet speaking there came a loud ring at the front door of
the little bungalow, followed immediately by the entrance of the
manager of a down-town vaudeville house.He plunged at once into his
errand.He would offer Carmen one hundred dollars a week, and a
contract for six months, to appear twice daily in his theater.but she did put it over
the society ginks."And the Beaubien, shivering at the awful
proposal, was glad Harris was there to lead the zealous theatrical man
firmly to the door.Lastly, came one Amos A. Hitt, gratuitously, to introduce himself as
one who knew Cartagena and was likely to return there in the not
distant future, where he would be glad to do what he might to remove
the stain which had been laid upon the name of the fair girl.The
genuineness of the man stood out so prominently that the Beaubien took
him at once into her house, where he was made acquainted with Carmen."Oh," cried the girl, "Cartagena!Why, I wonder--do you know Padre
Jose de Rincon?""A priest who once taught there in the University, many years ago?And
who was sent up the river, to Simiti?Then Carmen fell upon his neck; and there in that moment was begun a
friendship that grew daily stronger, and in time bore richest fruit.It soon became known that Hitt was giving a course of lectures that
fall in the University, covering the results of his archaeological
explorations; so Carmen and Father Waite went often to hear him.And
the long breaths of University atmosphere which the girl inhaled
stimulated a desire for more.Besides, Father Waite had some time
before announced his determination to study there that winter, as long
as his meager funds would permit."I shall take up law," he had one day said."It will open to me the
door of the political arena, where there is such great need of real
men, men who stand for human progress, patriotism, and morality.I
shall seek office--not for itself, but for the good I can do, and the
help I can be in a practical way to my fellow-men.Carmen shared the inspiration; and so she, too, with the Beaubien's
permission, applied for admittance to the great halls of learning, and
was accepted.*       *       *       *       *

"And now," began Father Waite that evening, when Hitt and his friend
had come, and, to the glad surprise of Carmen, Elizabeth Wall had
driven up in her car to take the girl for a ride, but had yielded to
the urgent invitation to join the little conference, "my plan, in
which I invite you to join, is, briefly, _to study this girl_!"Carmen's eyes opened wide, and her face portrayed blank amazement, as
Father Waite stood pointing gravely to her.Nor were the others less
astonished--all but the Beaubien."Let me explain," Father Waite continued."We are assembled here
to-night as representatives, now or formerly, of very diversified
lines of human thought.I have stood as the
embodiment of Christly claims, as the active agent of one of the
mightiest of human institutions, the ancient Christian Church.For
years I have studied its accepted authorities and its all-inclusive
assumptions, which embrace heaven, earth, and hell.For years I sought
with sincere consecration to apply its precepts to the dire needs of
humanity.I have traced its origin in the dim twilight of the
Christian era and its progress down through the centuries, through
heavy vicissitudes to absolute supremacy, on down through schisms and
subsequent decline, to the present hour, when the great system seems
to be gathering its forces for a life and death stand in this, the New
World.I have known and associated with its dignitaries and its humble
priests.I know the policies and motives underlying its quiet
movements.And so I
withdrew from it my allegiance."Carmen's thought, as she listened, was busy with another whose
experience had not been dissimilar, but about whom the human coils had
been too tightly wound to be so easily broken.Hitt," Father Waite went on, "represented
the great protest against the abuses and corruption which permeated
the system for which I stood.He, like myself, embodied the eternal
warfare of the true believer against the heretic.Yet, without my
churchly system, I was taught to believe, he and those who share his
thought are damned.we both claimed the same
divine Father, and accepted the Christly definition of Him as Love.We
were two brothers of the same great family, yet calling each other
_anathema_!""And to-day," he continued, "we
brothers are humbly meeting on the common ground of failure--failure
to understand the Christ, and to meet the needs of our fellow-men with
our elaborate systems of theology.""I heard another priest, years ago, make a similar confession," said
Hitt reflectively."I would he were here to-night!""He is here, in spirit," replied Father Waite; "for the same spirit of
eager inquiry and humble desire for truth that animates us no doubt
moved him.I have reason to think so," he added, looking at Carmen."For this girl's spiritual development I believe to be very largely
his work."He knew but little as yet of her
past association with the priest Jose.Hitt, represented the greatest systems of so-called
Christian belief," pursued Father Waite."Madam Beaubien, on the other
hand, has represented the world that waits, as yet vainly, for
redemption.We have not been able to afford it her.Yet--pardon my
frankness in thus referring to you, Madam.It is only to benefit us
all--that the means of redemption _have_ been brought to her, we must
now admit."She started to speak, but Father
Waite raised a detaining hand."Miss Wall
represents the weariness of spirit and unrest abroad in the world
to-day, the spirit that finds life not worth the while; and Mr.Haynerd voices the cynical disbelief, the agnosticism, of that great
class who can not accept the childish tenets of our dogmatic systems
of theology, yet who have nothing but the philosophy of stoicism or
epicureanism to offer in substitute.""You have me correctly classified," he said."I'm a Yankee, and from Missouri.""And now, having placed us," said the Beaubien, "how will you classify
Carmen?"Father Waite looked at the girl reverently."Hers is the leaven," he
replied gently, "which has leavened the whole lump."My good friends," he went on earnestly, "like all priests and
preachers, I have been but a helpless spectator of humanity's
troubles.I have longed and prayed to know how to do the works which
Jesus is said to have done; yet, at the sick-bed or the couch of
death, what could I do--I, to whom the apostolic virtue is supposed to
have descended in the long line of succession?I could give promises of
remitted sins--though I knew I spoke not truth.I could comfort by
voicing the insipid views of our orthodox heaven.And yet I know that
what I gave was but mental nostrums, narcotics, to stupify until death
might end the suffering."And if you were a good orthodox priest," interposed Haynerd, "you
would refuse burial to dissenters, and bar from your communion table
all who were not of your faith, eh?""I would have to, were I consistent; for Catholicism is
the only true faith, founded upon the revealed word of God, you know."He smiled pathetically as he looked around at the little group."Now," he continued, "you, Mr.Haynerd, are a man of the world.You
are not in sympathy with the Church.You are an infidel, an
unbeliever.And therefore are you '_anathema_,' you know.""But you can not deny that at times you think very
seriously.And, I may go farther: you long, intensely, for something
that the world does not offer.Now, what is it but truth that you are
seeking?""I want to know," answered Haynerd quickly.I
am fond of exhibitions of sleight-of-hand and jugglery.But the
priestly thaumaturgy that claims to transform a biscuit into the
flesh of a man dead some two thousand years, and a bit of grape juice
into his blood, irritates me inexpressibly!And so does the
jugglery by which your Protestant fellows, Hitt, attempt to reconcile
their opposite beliefs.Why, what difference can it possibly make
to the Almighty whether we miserable little beings down here are
baptised with water, milk, or kerosene, or whether we are immersed,
sprinkled, or well soused?for nearly twenty centuries
you have been wandering among the non-essentials.Isn't it time to get
down to business, and instead of burning at the stake every one who
differs with you, try conscientiously to put into practice a few of
the simple moral precepts, such as the Golden Rule, and loving
one's neighbor as one's self?""There," commented Father Waite, "you have a bit of the world's
opinion of the Church!Can we say that the censure is not just?Would
not Christ himself to-day speak even more scathingly to those who
advocate a system of belief that puts blinders on men's minds, and
then leads them into the pit of ignorance and superstition?""Ye have taken away the key of knowledge," murmured Carmen; "ye
entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye
hindered."exclaimed Haynerd, looking at the girl who stood as a
living protest against all that hampers the expansion of the human
mind; that quenches its note of joy, and dulls its enlarging and ever
nobler concept of God."Now I want to know, first, if there is a God;
and, if so, what He is, and what His relation is to me.I want to know
what I am, and why I am here, and what future I may look forward to,
if any.I don't care two raps about a God who can't help me here on
earth, who can't set me right and make me happy--cure my ills, meet my
needs, and supply a few of the luxuries as well.And if there is a
God, and we can meet Him only by dying, then why in the name of common
sense all this hullabaloo about death?Why, in that case, death is the
grandest thing in life!But
you preacher fellows fight death tooth and nail.You're scared stiff
when you contemplate it.You make Christianity just a grand
preparation for death.Yet it isn't the gateway to life to you, and
you know it!Then why, if you are honest, do you tell such rubbish to
your trusting followers?""I would remind you," returned Hitt with a little laugh, "that I
don't, now.""Well, friends," interposed Father Waite, "it is to take up for
earnest consideration just such questions as Mr.Haynerd propounds,
that I have my suggestion to make, namely, that we meet together once
or twice a week, or as often as we may agree upon, to search for--"
his voice dropped to a whisper--"to search for God, and with this
young girl as our guide.For I believe she is very close to Him.The
world knows God only by hearsay.Carmen has _proved_ Him."Men ask why it is," he went on, "that God remains hidden from them;
why they can not understand Him.They forget that Jesus revealed God
as Love.And, if that is so, in order to know Him all mankind must
love their fellow-men.But they go right on hating one another,
cheating, abusing, robbing, slaying, persecuting, and still wondering
why they don't know God, regardless of the only possible way of ever
working out from the evils by which they are beset, if we believe that
Jesus told the truth, or was correctly reported."He paused and
reflected for a moment.Then:

"The ancient prophet said: 'Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye
shall search for me with all your hearts.'It is my proposal that we
bind ourselves together in such a search.To it we can bring diverse
talents.To our vast combined worldly experience, I bring knowledge of
the ancient Greek and Latin Fathers, together with Church history.Hitt brings his command of the Hebrew language and history, and an
intimate acquaintance with the ancient manuscripts, and Biblical
interpretation, together with a wide knowledge of the physical
sciences.Madam Beaubien, Miss Wall, and Mr.Haynerd contribute their
earnest, searching, inquisitive spirit, and a knowledge of the world's
needs.Moreover, we all come together without bias or prejudice.And
Carmen--she contributes that in which we have all been so woefully
lacking, and without which we can _never_ know God, the rarest,
deepest spirituality.Shall we
undertake the search, my friends?It means a study of her thought, and
the basis upon which it rests."The Beaubien raised her hand to her moist eyes.She was thinking of
that worldly coterie which formerly was wont to meet nightly in her
magnificent mansion to prey upon their fellows.Oh, how different the
spirit of this little gathering!"You will meet here, with me," she said in a broken voice.There were none there unacquainted with the sorrows of this penitent,
broken woman.Each rose in turn and clasped her hand.Carmen threw
her arms about her neck and kissed her repeatedly."You see," said the Beaubien, smiling up through her tears, "what this
child's religion is?Would the swinging of incense burners and the
mumbling of priestly formulae enhance it?""Jesus said, 'Having seen me ye have seen God,'" said Father Waite."And I say," replied the Beaubien, "that having seen this child, you
have indeed seen Him."CHAPTER 2


"I'm afraid," Haynerd was saying, as he and Father Waite were wending
their way to the Beaubien home a few evenings later, "that this Carmen
is the kind of girl you read about in sentimental novels; the kind who
are always just ready to step into heaven, but who count for little in
the warfare and struggle of actual mundane existence.She
isn't quite true to life, you know, as a book critic would say of an
impossible heroine.""You mistake, my friend," replied Father Waite warmly."She is the
very kind we would see oftener, were it not for the belief that years
bring wisdom, and so, as a consequence, the little child is crushed
beneath a load of false beliefs and human laws that make it reflect
its mortal parents, rather than its heavenly one.""But I'd like to see her under stress--"

"Under stress!You haven't the slightest conception
of the stress she's been under most of her life!But your criticism
unconsciously pays her the highest tribute, for her kind never show by
word, deed, or look what they are enduring.That frail-appearing girl
has stood up under loads that would have flattened you and me out like
gold leaf!"She's so far and away ahead
of mortals like you and me that she doesn't admit the reality and
power of evil--and, believe me, she's got her reasons for not
admitting it, too!Only try humbly to
attain a little of her understanding and faith; and try to avoid
making yourself ridiculous by criticising what you do not comprehend.That, indeed, has been mankind's age-long blunder--and they have
thereby made asses of themselves!"Edward Haynerd, or "Ned," as he was invariably known, prided himself
on being something of a philosopher.And in the name of philosophy he
chose to be quixotic.That one who hated the dissimulations and shams
of our class aristocracy so cordially should have earned his
livelihood--and a good one, too--as publisher of the Social Era, a
sprightly weekly chronicle of happenings in fashionable society, would
have appeared anomalous in any but a man gifted in the Greek
sophistries and their modern innumerable and arid offshoots.Haynerd
was a laughing Democritus, an easy-going, even-tempered fellow, doomed
to be loved, and by the same graces thoroughly cheated by the world in
general.He had in his rapid career of some thirty-five years dipped
deeply into things mundane, and had come to the surface, sputtering
and blowing, with his face well smeared with mud from the shallow
depths.Whereupon he remarked that such an existence was a poor way of
serving the Lord, and turned cynic.It
was likewise his capital and stock-in-trade.By it he won a place for
himself in the newspaper world, and later, as a credit asset, had
employed it successfully in negotiating for the Social Era.It taking
over the publication of this sheet he had remarked that life was
altogether too short to permit of attempting anything worth while; and
so he forthwith made no further assaults upon fame--assuming that he
had ever done so--but settled comfortably down to the enjoyment of his
sinecure.And as justification for his
self-imposed celibacy he pompously quoted Kant: "I am a bachelor, and
I could not cease to be a bachelor without a disturbance that would be
intolerable to me."He simply shirked
responsibility and ease-threatening risk."You see," he remarked, explaining himself later to Carmen, "I'm a
pseudo-litterateur--I conduct a 'Who's It?'for the quidnunces of this
blase old burg.And I really meet a need by furnishing an easy method
of suicide, for my little vanity sheet is a sort of social mirror,
that all who look therein may die of laughter.By the way, I had to
run those base squibs about you; but, by George!I'm going to make a
retraction in next Saturday's issue.I'll put a crimp in friend Ames
that'll make him squeal.I'll say he has ten wives, and eight of 'em
Zulus, at that!""We have enough to meet, without
going out of our way to stir up more.Let it all work out now, as it
will, in the right way."Say, don't you
think that in formulating a new religion you're carrying coals to
Newcastle?Seems to me we've got enough now, if we'd practice 'em."Haynerd, is only the practice of the teachings of a
Nazarene Jew, named Jesus," she replied gently."Well, my religion is Socialism, I guess," he said lightly.So we
meet on common ground, don't we?"She held out her hand, and he took
it, a puzzled expression coming into his face."Well," he said, glancing about, "we'll have to dispute that later.I
see Father Waite is about to open this little religious seminar.But
we'll get back to the discussion of myself," he added, his eyes
twinkling."For, like Thoreau, I prefer to discuss that subject,
because there's no other about which I know so much.""Nor so little," she added, laughing and squeezing his hand as she
turned from him.The little coterie took their places around the dining room table,
which was well strewn with books of reference and writing materials.A deep, reverent silence fell
upon the group."Friends," began Father Waite slowly, "we are inaugurating to-night a
mission of the most profound significance.No question so vitally
touches the human race as the one which we shall reverently discuss in
this and subsequent meetings.I thought as I came in here to-night of
the wisdom of Epictitus, who said, 'What do I want?To acquaint myself
with the true order of things and comply with it.'I am sure no
statement so fully expresses our common desire as that.""If Adam was a Baptist, I want to know
and comply with the fact."Then Father Waite held up a hand and again
became serious."Can we treat lightly even the Adam story, when we consider how much
misery and rancor its literal acceptance has caused among mankind?Out of deepest sympathy for a world in search of truth, let us pity
their stumblings, and take heed that we fall not ourselves."Carmen's hand stole toward the
Beaubien's and clasped it tightly."In these days, as of old, it is still said, 'There is no God!'And
yet, though the ignorant and wilful admit it not, mankind's very
existence is a function of their concept of a Creator, a sole
cause of all that is.No question, economic, social, political, or
other, is so vitally related to humanity as this: 'Is there a God?'And the corollary: 'What is His relation to me?'For there can be
nothing so important as a knowledge of truth.Can the existence
of a God be demonstrated?Can He be shown to be beneficent, in
view of the world's testimony?If the
Bible, then can its authenticity be established?The greatest of
our so-called civilizations are known as Christian.But who can say
by them what Christianity really is?""I am quite prepared to say what it is not!""Doubtless," resumed Father Waite.But at present
we are seeking constructive criticism, not solely destructive.There
has been quite enough of that sort in the world.But, to go a step
further, can we say positively that the truth is to be found even in
Christianity?""Please explain your question," said Miss Wall, with a puzzled look."The first essential is always facts," he continued."The deduction of
right conclusions will follow--provided, as Matthew Arnold so tersely
said, we have sufficient delicacy of perception, subtlety, wisdom, and
tact.And, I may add, sufficient freedom from prejudice and mental
bias--ah, there is the stumbling block!""Matthew Arnold," ventured Haynerd, "was dubbed a first-class infidel,
as I recall it."As have been many of the world's most earnest searchers.Yet he enunciated much truth, which we to-day are acknowledging.But,
to resume, since Christianity as we know it is based upon the
personality of a man, Jesus, we ask: Can the historicity of Jesus be
established?"queried Miss Wall in greater
surprise than before.And if so, is he correctly reported in what we call the Gospels?Then, did he reveal the truth to his followers?And, lastly, has that
truth been correctly transmitted to us?""And," added Hitt, "there is still the question: Assuming that he gave
us the truth, can we apply it successfully to the meeting of our daily
needs?""The point is well taken," replied Father Waite."For, though I may
know that there are very abstruse mathematical principles, yet I may
be utterly unable to demonstrate or use them.But now," he went on,
"we are brought to other vital questions concerning us.They are, I
think, points to which the theologian has given but scant thought.If
we conclude that there is a God, we are confronted with the material
universe and man.And what are their natures and
import?""Seems to me you've cut out a large
assignment for this little party.Those are questions that the world
has played football with for thousands of years.Do you think we can
settle them in a few evenings' study?We can't spare you," laughed Father Waite.Then he glanced at
Carmen, who had sat quiet, apparently unhearing, during the remarks."I think you will hear things soon that will set you thinking," he
said."But now we are going to let our traveled friend, Mr.Hitt,
give us just a word in summation of his thought regarding the
modern world and its attitude toward the questions which we have been
propounding."The explorer leaned back in his chair and assumed his customary
attitude when in deep thought.All eyes turned upon him in eager
expectation."The world," he began reflectively, "presents to me to-day the most
interesting aspect it has assumed since history began.True, the age
is one of great mental confusion.Quite as true, startling discoveries
and astounding inventions have so upset our staid old mediaeval views
that the world is hurriedly crowding them out, together with its God.Doctrines for which our fathers bled and burned are to-day lightly
tossed upon the ash heap.The searchlight is turned never so
mercilessly upon the founder of the Christian religion, and upon the
manuscripts which relate his words and deeds.Yet most of us have
grown so busy--I often wonder with what--that we have no time for that
which can not be grasped as we run.We work desperately by day,
building up the grandest material fabric the world has ever seen; and
at night we repair the machine for the next day's run.Even our
college professors bewail the lack of time for solid reading and
research.And if our young pursue studies, it is with the almost
exclusive thought of education as a means of earning a material
livelihood later, and, if possible, rearing a mansion and stocking its
larder and garage.It is, I repeat, a grandly materialistic age,
wherein, to the casual observer, spirituality is at a very low ebb."He thrust his long legs under the table and cast his eyes upward to
the ceiling as he resumed:

"The modern world is still in its spiritual infancy, and does not
often speak the name of God.Not that we are so much irreverent as
that we feel no special need of Him in our daily pursuits.Since we
ceased to tremble at the thunders of Sinai, and their lingering echoes
in bulls and heresy condemnations, we find that we get along just as
well--indeed, much better.And it really is quite bad form now to
speak continually of God, or to refer to Him as anything real and
vital.To be on such terms of intimacy with Him as this girl Carmen
is--in thought, at least--would be regarded to-day as evidence of
sentimentalism and weakness."He paused again, to marshal his thought and give his auditors an
opportunity for comment.Then, as the silence remained unbroken, he
continued:

"Viewing the world from one standpoint, it has achieved remarkable
success in applying the knout to superstition and limitation.But,
like a too energetic housekeeper, it has swept out much that is
essential with the _debris_.When spirituality ceases to be real or
vital to a people, then a grave danger threatens them.Materiality has
never proved a blessing, as history shows.Life that is made up of
strain and ceaseless worry is not life.The incessant accumulation of
material wealth, when we do not know how really to enjoy it, is folly.To pamper the flesh, to the complete ignoring of the spirit, is
suicide.The increased hankering after physical excitements and animal
pleasures, to the utter abandonment of the search for that which is
real and satisfying, is an exhibition of gross, mesmeric stupidity, to
say the least.It shows that our sense of life is awry.""But the world is surely attempting its own betterment," protested
Haynerd."I grant you that," replied Hitt."But legislation and coercion are
the wrong means to employ."Oh, well, you are not going to change the race until the individual
himself changes.""Quite the contrary, that is the
pith of my observations.And no sane
man will maintain that general reform can ever come until the
individual's needs are met--his daily, hourly, worldly needs.""I think I get your point," said Father Waite."It is wholly a
question of man's concept of the cause of things, himself included,
and their purpose and end, is it not?""The restless spirit of the modern world is
hourly voicing its discontent with a faltering faith which has no
other basis than blind belief.It wants demonstrable fact upon which
to build.In plain words, _mankind would be better if they but knew
how_!""Well, we show them how," asserted Haynerd."But they don't do as we
tell 'em.""Are you quite sure that you show them how?""What do you
ever do toward showing them how permanently to eradicate a single
human difficulty?""Oh, well, putting it that way, nothing, of course."And so
the world continues to wait for surcease from woe in a life beyond the
grave.But now, returning to our survey, let me say that amid all the
folly of vain pursuits, of wars and strife, of doleful living and
pitiable dying, there are more encouraging and hopeful signs hung out
to the inquiring thought to-day than ever before in history.If I
misread not, we are already entered upon changes so tremendous that
their end must be the revolutionizing of thought and conduct, and
hence of life.Our present age is one of great extremes: though we
touch the depths, we are aiming likewise at the heights.I doubt if
there ever was a time when so many sensed the nothingness of the
pleasures of the flesh.I doubt if ever there was such a quickening of
the business conscience, and such a determined desire to introduce
honesty and purity into our dealings with one another.Never was the
need of religion more keenly felt by the world than it is to-day; and
that is why mankind are willing to accept any religious belief,
however eccentric, that comes in the guise of truth and bearing the
promise of surcease from sin, sickness, and sorrow here this side of
the grave.The world was never so hungry for religious truth; and this
fact is a perpetual challenge to the Church.There is a tremendous
world-yearning to know and to do better.I
answer, a growing appreciation of the idea that 'the kingdom of
harmony is within you.'""Jesus said that," murmured Carmen, looking up."He but amplified and gave form to the great fact that there was
an influence for better things always existent in the ancient Jews,
that'something not ourselves,' if you will, 'that makes for
righteousness.'And he showed that that influence could be outwardly
externalized in freedom from the ills which beset humanity.""Very good," put in Haynerd."That'something not ourselves' is the germ of the true idea of God,"
answered Hitt."The terms are synonymous," said Hitt."And now let me conclude with a
final observation.Mankind's beliefs are in a whirl.Orthodoxy and conservatism are hanging desperately to the
world's flying skirts, but they will eventually drop off.No change in
thought has been greater than that concerning God.The absentee Lord
who started the universe and then withdrew has gone to the scrap heap,
with the ridiculous views of predestination and infant damnation.The
idea of a God who at divers times interfered with His creation and
temporarily set aside His own laws to convince puny man of His
greatness, is likewise obsolescent.The world is slowly growing into a
conception of a creator, of some kind, but at least mental, and
universally present.Nay, more, available for all our problems and
needs.And the end will be the adoption of that conception, enlarged
and purified still further, and taken into the minutest affairs of our
daily life--as this girl has done.The day of patient suffering in
this world, under the spell of a promise of compensating reward in the
heavenly future, has all but passed.We are gradually becoming
conscious of the stupendous fact that the kingdom of all harmony,
immortality, and good, is _right here within us_--and therefore can be
naught but a consciousness of absolute good, perfectly attainable by
humanity as the 'old man' of Paul is laid off, but not gained,
necessarily, through what we call death."The silence which followed was broken at length by Miss Wall."And
what constitutes the 'old man'?""Largely, I think," said Hitt, "the belief that matter is real."exclaimed Haynerd, almost rising from his chair."I stand on my statement," he replied.Father Waite rose slowly, as if lost in thought."History shows," he
said, meditatively, "that man's progress has been proportionate to his
freedom from the limitation of ignorance and undemonstrable belief.And that freedom has come as man's concept of God has grown less and
less material, and more and more spiritual.From the animal nature of
the savage, to whom all is matter, down--or up--to the man of to-day,
to whom mind is assuming ever greater ascendency, man's progress has
been marked by a throwing off of limiting beliefs, theological or
other, in material power and substance.The development of the least
material forces, steam, electricity, the X-ray, has come only as the
human mind has thrown off a portion of its hampering material beliefs.I am astounded when I think of it, and of its marvelous message to
future generations!For, from the premise that the creator of all
things is spirit, or mind, as you will, comes the corollary that the
creation itself must of necessity be _mental_.And from this come such
deductions as fairly make me tremble.Carmen has told me of the
deductions which her tutor, the priest Jose, drew from the single
premise that the universe is infinite in extent--a premise which I
think we all will accept.""There can be no question about it," said Hitt, nodding his head."Well," continued Father Waite, "that granted, we must likewise grant
its creator to be infinite, must we not?""And that puts the creator out of the matter-class entirely.The
creator must be--"

"Mind," said Carmen, supplying the thought ever-present with her."I see no other conclusion," said Father Waite."But, that granted, a
flood of deductions pours in that sends human beliefs and reasoning
helter-skelter.For an infinite mind would eventually disintegrate if
it were not perfect in every part.""Perhaps it is already disintegrating, and that's what causes the evil
in the world," hazarded Haynerd."Utterly untenable, my friend," put in Hitt."For, granted an infinite
mind, we must grant the concomitant fact that such a mind is of very
necessity omnipotent, as well as perfect.What, then, could ever cause
disintegration in it?""You are right," resumed Father Waite."And such a mind, of very
necessity perfect, omnipotent, and, of course, ever-present, must
likewise be eternal.For there would be nothing to contest its
existence.Age, decay, and death would be unknown to it."And that," said Carmen, rising, "is my God."Father Waite nodded significantly to the others, and sat down, leaving
the girl facing them, her luminous eyes looking off into unfathomed
distances, and her face aglow with spiritual light."My God is infinite Good, to whom evil is unknown," she said."And
good includes all that is real.It includes wisdom, intelligence,
truth, life, and love--none of them material.Oh, not
by human reasoning, whereby you seek to establish the fact of His
existence, but by proof, daily proof, and in the hours when the floods
of suppositional evil have swept over me.You would rest your faith on
your deductions.But, as Saint Gregory said, no merit lies in faith
where human reason supplies the proof; and that you will all some day
know.And He ceaselessly expresses Himself in and
through His ideas, which He is constantly revealing.And these ideas express that goodness and
infinitude, from the tiniest up to the idea of God himself.And that
grandest idea is--man.Oh, no, not the men and women you think you see
about you in your daily walk.But the man that Jesus always saw back of every human concept.That
man is God's own idea of Himself.That is the man we shall all put on when we have
obeyed Paul and put off the old man, its counterfeit.""Then, Carmen," said Father Waite, "you believe all things to be
mental?""Yes, everything--man himself--and matter.""But, if God is mind, and infinite, He must include all things.Hence
He must include this imperfect representation, called the physical
man."Did not Jesus speak often of
the one lie about his Father, God?The material man and the material
universe are but parts of that lie.And a lie is always a supposition;
not real.All evil is contained in that supposition--a supposition
that there is power and life and substance apart from God.""A supposition is not made," replied Carmen quietly."I don't quite get that," interposed Miss Wall, her brows knitting.Carmen smiled down at the inquiring woman."The
creator of all things is mind.But you would have that
mind the creator of evil, also.Yet, your own reasoning has shown
that, on the premise of mind as infinite, such mind must be forever
whole, harmonious, perfect.The thoughts and ideas by which that mind
expresses itself must be likewise pure and perfect.Then that creative
mind can not create evil.For, a mind that creates evil must itself be
evil.And, being infinite, such a mind must include the evil it
creates.We would have, then, either a mind wholly evil, or one of
mixed evil and good.In either case, that mind must then destroy
itself."Your reasoning is, certainly," admitted Miss Wall."But, how to
account for evil, when God is infinite good--"

"To account for it at all," replied Carmen, "would be to make it
something real.Jesus would account for it only by classing it as a
lie about God.Now God, as the creative mind, must likewise be truth,
since He is perfection and harmony.Very well, a lie is always the
opposite of truth."Yes," said Father Waite, nodding his head as certain bright memories
returned to him."That is what you told me that day when I first
talked with you."Is it strange that God should have a suppositional opposite?""Has not everything with which you are concerned a
suppositional opposite?His suppositional opposite is
the great lie of evil.And matter is just as
mental as the thoughts which you are now holding.And so, evil and the lie are unreal.""The distinction seems to me theoretical," protested Miss Wall."That word'real,'" he said, "is perhaps
what is causing your confusion.The real is that which, according to
Spencer, does not pass away.We used to believe matter indestructible,
forever permanent.We learn that our views regarding it were very
incorrect."And yet," said Father Waite, "in this universe of constant change,
_something_ endures.What is it but the mind that is God, expressing
itself in such immaterial and permanent things as law, love, life,
power?""But now we have been brought back again to
the question of matter.If we can prove that matter is mental, and not
real substance, we will have established Carmen's premise that
everything is mental.Then there remains but the distinction between
the mind that is God, and its suppositional opposite, as expressed in
human existence.Let us conclude, therefore, that to-night we have
established, at least as a working hypothesis, that, since a thing
existing implies a creator; and since the existent universe, being
infinite, demands an infinite creator; and since a creator can not be
infinite without being at once mind, perfect, eternal, omnipotent,
omniactive, and good, we are fully justified in assuming that the
creator of all things still exists, and is infinite, ever-present
mind.Further than that we are not prepared to go, until we have
discussed the questions of matter and the physical universe and man.Let us leave those topics for a subsequent meeting.And now I suggest
that we unite in asking Carmen to sing for us, to crown the unity that
has marked this discussion with the harmony of her own beautiful
voice."A few moments later, about the small upright piano which the Beaubien
had rented for Carmen, the little group sat in reverent silence, while
the young girl sent out through the little room the harmonious
expression of her own inner life, the life that had never left heaven
for earth.CHAPTER 3


With her exit from the _beau monde_ and her entrance upon the broad
stage of University life, Carmen seemed to have awakened from the
lethargy which her abrupt transition from mediaeval Simiti into the
modern world had occasioned.The static struggle to hold her own
against the rushing currents of materialism had turned at length in
her favor.The lethal influences which
rose about her like stupifying fumes in the courts of fashion had been
lifted and swept away by the fresher and more invigorating breezes
into which her bark had now been drawn.She plunged into her new work joyously; yet not without a deeper
comprehension of its meaning than that of her fellow-students.She
knew that the University was but another stepping-stone, even as her
social life had been; another series of calls and opportunities to
"prove" her God to be immanent good.For she was keenly alive to the materialistic leadings of
the "higher education," and she would stand as a living protest
against them.It had not taken her long to discover the impotence lying at the heart
of so-called modern education.She had not been slow to mark the
disappointment written upon the faces of many of her fellow-students,
who had sought in vain a great awakening light in those sacred
precincts of learning, but, their confidence betrayed, were now
floundering in the devouring morass of materialism.To her keen
insight the University stood revealed as the great panderer to this
latest century's obsessing idea that the true function of education is
expressed in the imparting of changing, human information and a
training for the business of earning one's daily bread according to
the infamous code of the world's carnal social system.The University
did not meet the most urgent need of the race by equipping men to
stand against the great crises of human experience.It did not teach
men to lay aside the counterfeit man of material sense; but rather
emphasized the world's belief in the reality of this man by minutely
detailed courses in his mundane history and the manifestations of his
pitiable ignorance in his wanton crimes and watery ambitions.To
Carmen, God was the most insistent fact of creation.And mankind's
existence could find its only justification in ceaseless, consecrated
manifestation of His harmonious activity.True, the University vaguely
recognized God as infinitely competent.But in the same breath it
confessed its utter ignorance of a demonstrable knowledge of Him, to
know whom alone is life.But their hollow prayers bore no hope, for they knew not how to gain
answers to them.And yet the girl remained in her new environment, awaiting the call to
"come up higher."And meantime she strove to gain daily a wider
knowledge of the Christ-principle, and its application to the needs
and problems of her fellow-men.Her business was the reflection of her
Father's business.The weak, transient,
flighty, so-called intellectual life which she saw about her sent no
call across the calm currents of her thought.Her education was
religious in the strictest, deepest sense, for she was learning to
know God.Though the girl pursued her way quietly, unwilling that the notoriety
which had been fastened upon her should mark her as an object of
curiosity, yet her story soon spread among University circles, and the
first semester was a scant two weeks old before her name had been
debated in the numerous Sororities and Women's Clubs, and quietly
dropped.<DW64> blood coursed in her veins; and the stigma of parental
disgrace lay dark upon her.She lived with a woman of blackened
reputation--a reputation which waxed no brighter under the casual,
malicious comments of J. Wilton Ames, whose great financial strength
had made him a Trustee of this institution of learning.If Carmen
divined the comment that was passed concerning herself, she gave no
indication.But Hitt and Father Waite knew that the girl had not found
favor in the social and fraternal organizations of her mates; and they
knew why.mused Hitt, when he could no longer
restrain himself.Then he called a student to his desk one day, at the
conclusion of his lecture."Miss West," he said, "you are leader in the most prominent Sorority
in the University.I want you to give Miss Carmen Ariza a bid."the girl asked, as she arched her brows.But--well, what if she were a negress?Hers is the
most brilliant mind in the entire student-body!"Race segregation is a divine tenet, scripturally justified.What though the girl's skin vied with the lilies and rosebuds?What
though her hair was the brown of ripe fields?Had not God Almighty
decreed that the <DW64> should remain a drawer of water?Had the Lord designed him the equal of the noble white, He would
have bleached his face, and bridged his flat nose.And the reference to her dark-skinned sisters caused a
little _moue_ of disgust, as she flatly declined to consider Carmen an
eligible candidate for membership in her Society.ejaculated Hitt, who had been brooding over the incident
as he walked home with Father Waite."That toadying, sycophantic,
wealth-worshiping Miss West can see no farther than the epidermis!If
we could have maintained Carmen's reputation as an Inca princess, this
same girl would have fawned at her feet, and begged to kiss the edge
of her robe!And she would have used every art of cajolery to
ingratiate herself into Carmen's favor, to catch the social crumbs
that our girl might chance to drop!""There, there, Hitt," soothed Father Waite."Have you any idea that
Carmen is at all injured by Miss West's supercilious conduct?"You're forgetting the girl's influence, aren't
you?"Hitt gulped his wrath down his long throat."Waite," he blurted, "that
girl's an angel!"She's so real that we don't
understand her--so real that she has been totally misunderstood by the
petty minds that have sought to crush her here in New York, that's
all.""But certainly she is unique--"

"Ah, yes; unique in that she goes about putting her arms around people
and telling them that she loves them.And she is unique in that her purity and goodness hang about her like
an exquisite aura, and make people instinctively turn and look after
her as she passes.Unique in that in her sweet presence one seems to
hear a strain of heavenly music vibrating on the air.So unique that
the dawn, the nesting birds, the wild flowers, the daily sunset,
fairly intoxicate her with ecstasy and make her life a lyric."Hitt essayed to reply; but the words hung in his throat."Yes," continued Father Waite, "she is so unique that when the
empty-headed, vain young Duke of Altern, learning that she had been
thrown out of society because of the base rumor regarding her
parentage, sent her a written statement to the effect that there was
no engagement between them, and demanded that she sign it, she did
so, with a happy smile, with an invocation, with a prayer for blessing
upon those who had tried to ruin her."Hawley-Crowles and Ames and Lafelle
filched La Libertad from her, she would have given them the clothes on
her back with it, if they had demanded them.Yes, she's unique--so
unique that again and again I hear her murmur, as she looks off
absently into space: 'If it is right that he should have a son, then I
want it to be so.'""Referring to--that priest--Jose de Rincon?"And time and again I have heard her say: 'God is
light.Old
Rosendo's grandson, you know.""Waite," he said earnestly, "she is simply illustrating
what would happen to any of us if we threw ourselves wholly upon
God's protecting care, and took our thoughts only from Him.That's
why she can lose her home, her family, her reputation, that
mine--everything--and still stand._She does what we don't dare to
do!_"

"She is a living illustration," replied Father Waite, "of the mighty
fact that there is nothing so practical as _real_ Christianity.I want
you to tell Professor Cane that.He calls her 'the girl with the
Utopian views,' because of her ingenuous replies in his sociological
class.But I want you to show him that she is very far from being
impractical.""I'll do it," said Hitt emphatically."I'll prove to Cane that her
religion is not a visionary scheme for regulating a world inhabited
only by perfect beings, but is a working principle for the every-day
sinner to use in the solution of his daily problems.Moreover, Waite,
she is a vivid illustration of the fact that when the individual
improves, the nation does likewise."I not only get you, but I stand as a proof of your statement,"
returned Father Waite gently.Carmen, her thoughts above, though her feet trod the earth, came and
went, glad and happy.The change in her mode of living from the
supreme luxury of the Hawley-Crowles mansion to the common comforts of
the home where now she dwelt so simply with the Beaubien, seemed not
to have caused even a ripple in the full current of her joy.Her life
was a symphony of thanksgiving; an antiphony, in which all Nature
voiced its responses to her in a diapason, full, rich, and harmonious.Often that autumn she might have been seen standing among the tinted
leaves on the college campus, and drinking in their silent message.And then she might have been heard to exclaim, as she turned her rapt
gaze beyond the venerable, vine-clad buildings: "Oh, I feel as if I
just couldn't stand it, all this wealth of beauty, of love, of
boundless good!"For her dark
story had reared a hedge about her; the taboo rested upon her; and
even in the crowded classrooms the schoolmates of her own sex looked
askance and drew their skirts about them.But if the students avoided her, the faculty did not.And those like
Professor Cane, who had the opportunity and the ability to peer into
the depths of the girl's soul, took an immediate and increasing
interest in her.Often her own naive manners broke down the bars of
convention, and brought her enduring friendships among the men of
learning.This was especially the case with Doctor Morton, Dean of the
School of Surgery.Yielding to a harmless impulse of curiosity, the
girl one afternoon had set out on a trip of exploration, and had
chosen the Anatomy building to begin with.Many odd sights greeted her
eager gaze as she peered into classrooms and exhibit cases; but she
met with no one until she chanced to open the door of Doctor Morton's
private laboratory, and found that eminent man bending over a human
brain, which he was dissecting.The doctor looked up, surprise
written large upon his features as he noted his fair caller.queried the girl, twisting around and
looking at the name on the door to make certain."Yes," replied the genial doctor, with growing interest.He was a
gray-haired, elderly man, slightly inclined to embonpoint, and with
keen, twinkling eyes."Yes, indeed," returned the girl; "I'd love to."Most everybody seems to have heard of me," sighed the girl."Well, it
doesn't make any difference about my coming in here, does it?"She
looked up at him so wistfully that he felt a great tug at his
heartstrings."You're as welcome as the April
sun.""Now tell me," she said eagerly,
looking about."That," said he, taking up the pulpy gray object, "is the brain of my
erstwhile friend and collaborator, Doctor Bolton.murmured Carmen, a facetious twinkle coming into
her eyes as she looked at it."In the interests of science," returned the man, studying her."That
we may increase our knowledge of this marvelous mechanism of thought,
and the laws by which it operates in mental processes.""Then you still blindly seek the living among the dead, don't you?""You think that this poor thing held life, and you
search now among its ashes for the living principle.But, God is life;
and 'Canst thou by searching find out God?'"The man regarded her intently without replying.She bent for a while
over the half-dissected brain in deep thought."Doctor," she said, "life is not structural.God is life; and to know
Him is to reflect life.Doctor, don't
you think it is about time to do away with this business of dying?"The man of science started visibly, and his eyes opened wider.The
abrupt question quite swept him off his feet."You didn't really expect to find anything in this brain, did you?""Why, mostly water, with a few commonplace salts," he answered,
wondering what the next question would be."And can a compound of water and a few commonplace salts _think_?"she
asked, looking intently at him."N--no," he answered tentatively."The brain is not the cause of thought, then, but an effect, is it
not?""Why, really, my dear Miss Carmen, we don't know.We call it the organ
of thought, because in some way thought seems to be associated with
it, rather than with--well, with the liver, or muscles, for example.And we learn that certain classes of mental disturbances are
intimately associated with lesions or clots in the brain.Then:

"Doctor, you wouldn't cut up a machine to discover the motive power,
would you?But that is just what you are doing there with that brain.You are hoping by dissecting it to find the power that made it go,
aren't you?And the power that made it go was mind--life.""But the life is not in the brain now," hazarded the doctor."You see," she went on, "if
the brain was ever alive, it could never cease to be so.If it ever
lived, it could never die.It
manifested only a false sense of life.Who
or what says that the man who owned that brain is dead?Why, the human
mind--human belief.It is the human mind, expressing its belief in
death, and in a real opposite to life, or God.She returned his look
with a confident smile."You believe in evolution, don't you?""Oh, surely," he replied unhesitatingly."Well, then, in the process of evolution, which was evolved first, the
brain, or the mind which operates it and through it?""Why," he replied meditatively, "it is quite likely that they evolved
simultaneously, the brain being the mind's organ of expression.""But don't you see, Doctor, that you are now making the mind really
come first?For that which expresses a thing is always secondary to
the thing expressed.""At any rate, it is quite immaterial to a
practical knowledge of how to meet the brain's ills.I am a practical
man, you know.""I'm sorry to hear that," she said simply."Practical men are so
stupid and ignorant."he exclaimed, putting his hands on his hips and
staring down at the smiling face."And you are so nice and friendly, I wouldn't want to think you stupid
and ignorant," she went on blandly.Well, that kind o' takes the edge off your former classification
of me," he said, greatly amused, yet wondering just what appraisal to
place upon this frank girl."And evolution," she continued, "is an unfolding, isn't it?You see,
the great fact of creation is the creator, infinite mind.Well, that
mind expresses itself in its ideas.And these it is unfolding all the
time.Now a fact always gives rise to a suppositional opposite.The
opposite of a fact is an error.And that is why error has been called
'negative truth.'Of course, there isn't any such thing as negative
truth!And so all error is simply falsity, supposition, without real
existence."Now, the human, or
carnal, mind is the negative truth of the real mind, God.It is
infinite mind's suppositional opposite.And it imitates the
infinite mind, but in a very stupid, blundering way.And so the whole
physical universe manifests evolution, too--an unfolding, or
revealing, of material types, or mental concepts.And all these
manifest the human mind's sense of life, and its equally strong
sense of death.The universe, animals, men, are all human types,
evolved, or unfolded, or revealed, in the human mind.And all are
the human mind's interpretations of infinite mind's real and eternal
and perfect ideas."You know," she laughed, "speaking of 'negative truth', the first
chapter of Genesis sets forth positive truth, and the second chapter
sets forth its opposite, negative truth.But
there it is for everybody to read.And the human mind, of course, true
to its beliefs, clings to the second chapter as the reality.Meantime, Carmen's attention had been attracted to a large microscope
that stood on the table near her.Going to it, she peeped curiously
down into the tube.Well," she suddenly asked, "have
you got the fear germ here?"But when the girl looked up, her face was quite
serious."You do not know it, Doctor, for you are a practical man, but you
haven't anything but fear germs under this glass," she said in a low
voice."Why, those are germs of typhoid and tuberculosis!""And manifestations, externalizations, of the fear germ itself, which
is mental," she added."These things don't cause disease," she went
on, pointing to the slide.Do you scientists know why people die, Doctor?""We really do not know why people die.""Then I'll tell you," she said."_It's because they don't know enough
to live._ This poor Doctor Bolton died because he didn't know that God
was life.He committed sickness, and then paid the penalty, death.He
sinned by believing that there were other powers than God, by
believing that life and thought were in matter.And so he paid the
wages of sin, death.He simply missed the mark, that's all.""You haven't asked me
to sit down," she commented brightly."But, if you don't mind, I
will."the doctor exclaimed, coloring, and hastily
setting out a chair."I really was so interested in what you were
saying that I forgot my manners.""No," she said, shaking her head as she declined the proffered chair,
"I'll sit here, so's I can look straight into your eyes.You go ahead
and cut up poor Yorick, and I'll talk.""You are much more interesting," he
returned, "than poor Bolton, dead or alive.In fact, he really was
quite a bore.But you are like a sparkling mountain rill, even if you
do give me a severe classification.""Well," she replied, "then you are honestly more interested in life
than in death, are you?"Death is _such_ a mistake; and I haven't a bit of use
for it," she continued."It's like making mistakes in music, or
mathematics.Now when we make mistakes in those, we never stop to
discuss them.The world has nearly
talked its poor old head off about the mistakes of sickness and death.It never seems to occur to the world that Jesus always associated
sickness with sin.You know, the Rabbis of his day seem to have hit
upon a great truth, although they didn't make it really practical.They maintained that a sick man could not be healed of his diseases
until all his sins had been forgiven.And so they attempted to forgive
sins and make men clean by their elaborate ceremonies.And nobody got to the root of the difficulty until
Jesus came.And that cured
the disease that was the manifestation of sin.Now I ask, why do you,
nearly two thousand years after his time, still do as the old Rabbis
did, and continue to treat the body--the effect--instead of the mental
cause?But," looking down in meditation, "I suppose if you did that
the people would cry, 'He hath a devil!'They thought I was a witch in
Simiti.""Then you do not believe that disease is
caused by microbes, I take it?"It is a
manifestation of the human mind again.And, as with typhoid fever,
diphtheria, and other diseases, the human mind applies its own
cherished, ignorant beliefs in certain methods, and then renders
innocuous its own manifestations, microbes.The human mind makes its
own diseases, and then in some cases removes the disease, but still by
human, material methods.At last it
yields itself to its false beliefs, and then goes out in what it calls
death.It is all a mental process--all human thought and its various
manifestations.Now why not get beyond microbes and reach the cause,
even of them, the human mind itself?Why do not you men of science do likewise?"Doctor Morton himself took the chair which he had set out for the
girl."What you say," he replied slowly, "is not new to me.But I can
only answer that the world is not ready yet for the great change which
you suggest."What mesmerism you are laboring
under!"Well, then, would he be accepted to-day, if he had not come before?""And I quite agree with you," she said firmly."Now the world has
doctored for more than four thousand years, despite the fact that
health is not sold in bottle or pill form.Doctor, what does the
history of all these centuries of drugging show you?"Carmen waited a moment; then continued:

"Don't they demonstrate the absolute inability of medicines to cure
disease?""Any more than putting men in prison cures
crime?""They at least prove that medication has not _permanently_ removed
disease," he ventured, not wishing to go too far."Doctor," she said earnestly, "that man Jesus, who, according to you,
came too soon, said: 'Without me ye can do nothing.'Well, didn't he
come very, very close to the truth when he made that statement?He did
not say that without drugs or material remedies we could do nothing,
but that without the Christ-principle mankind would continue, as
before, to miss the mark.He showed that disease and discord result
from sin.Sin is lack of righteousness, lack of right-thinking about
things.Its effect,
disease, is mental--a state of discordant consciousness.Can you with
drugs change a state of mind?""Whiskey and opium cause changes in
one's state of mind.""But the human belief of power inherent in whiskey
and opium, or of the human body's reaction to them, causes a change in
the human thought-activity that is called consciousness.The state of
human consciousness changes with the belief, but not the real state of
mind.And Doctor Bolton--"

"Bolton was not sick.He died of natural causes, old age, and general
breakdown," was the doctor's refuge.Carmen laughed and sprang down from the table."What an obstinately
obdurate lot you scientific men are!""Don't you know
that you doctors are only a development of the old'medicine-man'?Bolton isn't dead; and, in the second, there
are no _natural_ causes of death.Why, that's gone out of
fashion, long since.""Then," with a note of banter in his voice, "I take it that you do not
expect to die.""I expect good, nothing but
good, ever!Don't you know that physiologists themselves admit that
the human body is composed of eighty-five per cent water and fifteen
per cent ordinary salts?Can such a combination have intelligence and
sensation?Do you still believe that life is dependent upon lungs,
stomach, or liver?Why, the so-called 'unit cell' breathes, digests,
and manifests life-functions, and yet it has no lungs, no mouth, no
stomach, no organs.It is the human mind, assuming knowledge and power
which it does _not_ possess, that says the sense of life shall depend
upon such organs in the one case and not in the other.And the human
mind could be utterly refuted if men would only learn to use the
Christ-principle.Jesus and Paul used it, and proved material laws to
be only false beliefs.""Well," he replied meditatively, "if you are correct, then the
preachers are way off the track.And I have long since come to the
conclusion that--Well," changing abruptly back to the previous topic,
"so you refute the microbe theory, eh?""I said I did and did not," she laughed."Listen: fear, worry, hatred,
malice, murder, all of which are mental things in themselves, manifest
to the human mind as microbes.These are the hurtful microbes, and
they produce toxins, which poison the system.It is
the Christ-principle.Now you can learn that principle, and how to
apply it.But if you don't care to, why, then you must go on with your
material microbes and poisons, and with your diseases and death, until
you are ready to leave them and turn to that which is real.For all
human-mind activity and manifestation, whether in microbes, death, or
life, is mental, and is but the counterfeit of the real activity of
divine mind, God."Do you know," she pursued earnestly, "I heard a lecture the other day
in which it was said that life is a sort of fermentation in the body.Well, as regards human life, I guess that is so.For the human body is
only a manifestation of the human mind; and the human mind surely is
in a continuous state of ferment!""The lecturer," she continued, "said that the
range of life was from ultra-microbe to man, and that Shakespeare
began as a single cell.The mundane concept of
Shakespeare's body may have unfolded from a cell-concept; but
Shakespeare was a manifestation of mind!And that mind was an
interpretation, though very imperfect, of the mind that is God.Why
can't you materialists raise your eyes above the dust?Why, you would
choke the very avenues of the spirit with mud!"Well, your education seems to be--"

"Yes," she interrupted, "my education is beyond the vagaries that are
so generally taught in the name of knowledge.It does nothing for mankind, except to give them a false
culture.Were the so-called great men of the past really educated?Here is an extract which I copied this afternoon from Hawthorne."She
opened her note book and read:

  "'Ah, but there is a half-acknowledged melancholy like to this
  when we stand in the perfected vigor of our life and feel that
  Time has now given us all his flowers, and that the next work of
  his never-idle fingers must be to steal them one by one away.'"Now," she asked, "was that man really educated?But that theology _could not solve his least earthly problem, nor
meet his slightest need_!Oh, what inexpressibly sad lives so many of
your greatest men have lived!Your Hawthorne, your Longfellow, they
yearned for the rest which they were taught was to follow death.If they
believed in the Christ--and they thought they did--why, then, did they
not rise up and do as he bade them do, put death out?He taught no
such resignation to human beliefs as they practiced!He showed men how
to overcome the world.He looked at her intently for some moments.She seemed, as she stood
there before him, like a thing of gossamer and sunshine that had
drifted into his laboratory, despite the closed door."Say," he suddenly exclaimed, as a new thought struck him, "I'd like
to have you talk with my friend, Reverend Patterson Moore!Pat and I
have barked at each other for many years now, and I'm getting tired.I'd like to shift him to a younger and more vigorous opponent.I
believe you've been providentially sent to relieve me.""You can tell Professor Hitt, and--"

"Hitt, eh?He is very much interested
in these things that you and I have been talking about to-day.We have
regular meetings, with Father Waite, and Mr.Haynerd, and--"

"Well, no wonder you can argue!But--suppose I have Hitt bring me to one of your meetings, eh?"The genial doctor laughed long and incontinently."I imagine Reverend
Pat wouldn't thank you for referring to him that way," he said."He is
a very high Anglican, and his dignity is marvelous--to say nothing of
his self-esteem.Well, we'll see, we'll see."I didn't really mean to come in here, you
know.But I guess I was led, don't you?"And when the door had closed upon her, the doctor sat silently beside
the pulseless brain of his deceased comrade and pondered long.*       *       *       *       *

When Carmen entered the house, late that afternoon, she found the
Beaubien in conversation with Professor Williams, of the University
School of Music.That gentleman had learned through Hitt of the girl's
unusual voice, and had dropped in on his way home to ask that he might
hear and test it.With only a smile for reply, Carmen tossed her books
and hat upon the sofa and went directly to the piano, where she
launched into the weird Indian lament which had produced such an
astounding effect upon her chance visitors at the Elwin school that
day long gone, and which had been running in her thought and seeking
expression ever since her conversation with Doctor Morton a short
while before.For a full half hour she sang, lost in the harmony that poured from
her soul.Father Waite entered, and quietly took a seat.Song after song, most of them the characteristic soft
melodies of her people, and many her own simple improvisations, issued
from the absorbed girl's lips.The Beaubien rose and stole softly from
the room.Father Waite sat with his head resting on his hand, striving
to interpret the message which welled from the depths of his own
being, where hidden, unused chords were vibrating in unison with those
of this young girl.Then, abruptly, the singing stopped, and Carmen turned and faced her
auditors."There," she said, with a happy sigh, "that just _had_ to
come out!""Who, may I ask, was your
teacher?"he said, in a voice husky with emotion.A look of astonishment came into the man's face.He turned to Father
Waite inquiringly.The latter nodded his confirmation of the girl's
words."I wonder if you realize what you
have got, Miss Carmen?""It's a beautiful gift, isn't it?""But--I had thought of asking you to let me train you--but--I--I dare
not undertake to handle such a voice as yours.May I--may I send
Maitre Rossanni to you, the great Italian?"Oh, yes," returned the girl; "I'll sing for anybody.The gift isn't
mine, you know.When the professor had taken his reluctant departure, the Beaubien
returned and handed Carmen a letter.With a cry of joy the girl seized
it and tore it open.It was from Colombia, the second one that her
beloved Rosendo had succeeded in getting down the river to the distant
coast.It had been written three months prior, and it bore many stains
and evidences of the vicissitudes through which it had emerged.Yes,
Rosendo and his family were well, though still at Maria Rosa, far up
the Boque, with Don Nicolas.The war raged below them, but they were
safe."And not a word from Padre Jose, or about him," murmured the girl,
sinking into a chair and clasping the soiled letter to her breast.Father Waite thought of the little newsboy of Cartagena, and his
possible share in the cause of Jose's silence.CHAPTER 4


Carmen's first serious test of her knowledge of English composition
was made early in the semester, in an essay on town life in Colombia;
and so meritorious did her instructor consider it that he advised her
to send it to a prominent literary magazine.The result was that the
essay was accepted, and a request made for further contributions.The girl bubbled with new-found happiness.Then she wrote another, and
still another article on the life and customs of her people.Both
were given publication; and with the money which she received for them
she bought a silk dress for Jude, much to that adoring woman's
surprise and vehement protest.Carmen might have saved the money
toward a piano--but, no; that would have been thinking of herself, and
was inadmissible.Nor did the Beaubien offer any objection."Indeed,"
commented that fond shepherd of this lone lamb, "she would have poured
the money out into somebody's open hand anyway, and it might as well
be Jude's."Then she choked back the tears as she added: "The girl comes home
every night with an empty purse, no matter how full it may have been
in the morning.Carmen's slight success in the field of letters still further aroused
Haynerd's interest.The peacefully somnolent Social Era, he thought,
might awaken to new things under the stimulus of such fresh writing as
hers.Perhaps life did hold something of real value after all.Would
she furnish him with a column or two on the peculiar social aspect of
the metropolis?And the result was that the staid conservative
sheet was given a smart shaking; and several prominent society people
sat up and blinked.It but threw a clear light from a somewhat unusual
angle upon certain phases of New York's social life, and uncovered a
few of the more subtly hidden springs of its peculiar activity.Among those who read her essay in the Social Era was J. Wilton Ames.He first lay back in his chair and laughed uproariously.And then,
when his agents discovered for him the identity of the author, he
glowered.The Beaubien was still standing between him and this budding
genius.And though he might, and would, ultimately ruin the Beaubien
financially, yet this girl, despite her social ostracism, bade fair to
earn with her facile pen enough to maintain them both in luxury.So he
bent anew to his vengeful schemes, for he would make them come to him.As Trustee, he would learn what courses the girl was pursuing in the
University--for he had long known that she was in attendance there.Then he would learn who her associates were; what suggestions and
advice her instructors gave her; and her plans for the future.And he
would trace her sources of income and apply pressure at the most vital
point.He had never in his life been successfully balked.Then Haynerd came to congratulate Carmen again, and to request that
she attend with him the formal opening of the new Ames mansion, the
great Fifth Avenue palace, for he wanted her vivid, first-hand
impressions for his account of the brilliant affair in the Social Era.As reporters, he explained, they would of necessity remain in
seclusion, and the girl might disguise to such an extent as to prevent
recognition, if she chose.It was business for him, and an opportunity
for rich experience for her.And the fearless girl went, because it
would help Haynerd, though the Beaubien inwardly trembled.Invitations to the number of three hundred had been issued to the
_elite_ of New York, announcing the formal opening of the newly
finished, magnificent Ames dwelling.These invitations were wrought in
enamel on cards of pure gold.A month prior to the opening, the
newspapers had printed carefully-worded announcements of the return of
Mrs.J. Wilton Ames and her daughter, after a protracted stay at
various foreign baths and rest-cures in the hope of restoring the
former's impaired health.Ames now felt that she could no
longer deprive society of her needed activities, and so had returned
to conduct it through what promised to be a season of unusual
brilliancy.The papers did not, however, state that J. Wilton had
himself recalled her, after quietly destroying his bill of divorce,
because he recognized the necessity of maintaining the social side of
his complicated existence on a par with his vast business affairs.As Carmen and Haynerd approached the huge, white marble structure,
cupolaed, gabled, buttressed, and pinnacled, an overwhelming sense of
what it stood for suddenly came upon the girl, and she saw revealed in
a flash that side of its owner's life which for so many months she had
been pondering.The great shadows that seemed to issue from the
massive exterior of the building swept out and engulfed her; and she
turned and clasped Haynerd's arm with the feeling that she would
suffocate were she to remain longer in them."Perk up, little one," said Haynerd, taking her hand."We'll go round
to the rear entrance, and I will present my business card there.Ames's secretary telephoned me instructions, and I said I was going to
bring a lady reporter with me."Carmen caught her breath as she passed through the tall, exquisitely
wrought iron gateway and along the marble walk which led to the rear.Up the winding steps to the front entrance, where swung the marvelous
bronze doors which had stirred the imaginations of two continents,
streamed the favored of the fashionable world.Among them Carmen saw
many whom she recognized.The buffoon, Larry Beers, was there,
swinging jauntily along with the bejeweled wife of Samson, the
multimillionaire packer.Kane and his wife, and Weston followed.Outside the gates there was incessant chugging of automobiles, mingled
with the shouted orders of the three policemen detailed to direct the
traffic.A pinched, ragged urchin and his tattered little sister crept
up and peered wildly through the iron pickets of the fence; but a
sharp rap from a policeman's club sent them scattering.Carmen stood
for a moment in the shadows and watched the swarm mount the marble
steps and enter through those wonderful doors.There were congressmen
and senators, magnates and jurists, distillers and preachers.Each one
owed his tithe of allegiance to Ames.Some were chained to him hard
and fast, nor would break their bonds this side of the grave.There were those who grew white under his most casual
glance.There were others who knew that his calloused hand was closing
about them, and that when it opened again they would fall to the
ground, dry as dust.Others, like moths, not yet singed, were hovering
ever closer to the bright, cruel flame.Reverend Darius Borwell,
bowing and smiling, alighted from his parochial car and tripped
blithely up the glistening marble steps.Each and all, wrapping the
skeleton of grief, greed, shame, or fear beneath swart broadcloth and
shimmering silk, floated up those ghostly steps as if drawn by a
tremendous magnet incarnate in the person of J. Wilton Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away.Hawley-Crowles sigh in the wake of that gilded assembly?Did the moans
of poor, grief-stricken Mrs.Gannette, sitting in her poverty and
sorrow, die into silence against those bronze doors?Was he, the being
who dwelt in that marble palace, the hydra-headed embodiment of the
carnal, Scriptural, age-old power that opposes God?How many others there were
scattered through the house itself, Haynerd could only guess.But he
passed inspection and was admitted with the girl.A butler took
immediate charge of them, and led them quickly through a short passage
and to an elevator, by which they mounted to another floor, where,
opening a paneled oak door, the dignified functionary preceded them
into a small reception hall, with lavatories at either end.Here he
bade them remove their wraps and await his return."Well," commented Haynerd, with a light, nervous laugh, "we've crossed
the Rubicon!A moment later the butler returned with a sharp-eyed young woman, Mrs."You will be very careful in your report," the latter began at once in
a business-like manner."And you will submit the same to me for
approval before it is published in your magazine.Ames deems that
imperative, since your recent publication of an essay on modern
society in this city.I have a list here of the guests, their business
and social standing, and other data.You
will say that this is the most brilliant assemblage ever gathered
under one roof in New York.The wealth represented here to-night will
total not less than three billion dollars.The jewels alone displayed
will foot up not less than twenty millions.Now, let me see," again
consulting her notes.Haynerd stole a covert glance at Carmen and winked."The chef," the secretary resumed, "was brought over from Paris by
Mrs.His name, Pierre Lotard, descendant of
the famous chef of the Emperor Napoleon First.He considers that his
menu to-night surpasses anything he ever before achieved.""May I ask," interrupted Haynerd, "the probable cost of the supper?""Yes, perhaps you had better mention that item.It will be in the
neighborhood of three hundred dollars a plate.House and table
decorations, about eight thousand dollars.The menu cards were hand-illuminated by Parisian
artists, and each bears a sketch illustrative or suggestive of the
guest to whom it is given.""Three thousand, if I correctly recall it," was the nonchalant reply."As to the viands, you will mention that they have been gathered from
every part of the world.Now come with me, and I will give you a hasty
sketch of the house, while the guests are assembling in the grand
salon.Then you will remain in the balcony, where you will make what
notes you wish on the dress displayed.Refreshments will be served to
you later in this waiting room.I need not remind you that you are not
expected to mingle with the guests, nor to address any one.Keep to
the balcony, and quite out of view."Opening a door opposite the one through which she had entered, the
young woman led her charges directly out upon the great marble balcony
overlooking the grand salon below.A rush of brilliant light engulfed
them, and a potpourri of chatter and laughter, mingled with soft music
from a distant organ, and the less distinct notes of the orchestra in
the still more distant ballroom, rose about them in confused babel, as
they tiptoed to the exquisitely carved marble railing and peered down
upon the gorgeous pageant.The ceiling rose far above them, delicately
tinted like a soft Italian sky.The lofty walls dropped, like
gold-gray veils, to the richly carved paneled wainscoting beneath,
which had once lined the halls of a mediaeval castle on the Rhine.The
great windows were hidden behind rare Venetian lace curtains, over
which fell hangings of brocade, repeating the soft tints of the wall
and the brocade-covered chairs and divans ranged close about the sides
of the splendid room.On the floor lay a massive, priceless Persian
carpet, dating from the fifteenth century.Haynerd drew a long breath, and whistled softly.From the end of the
salon he could mark the short flight of steps which led to the
mezzanine, with its walls heavily tapestried, and broken by rich oak
doors opening into lavatories and lounging rooms, itself widening at
the far end into the grand billiard and smoking parlors, done off in
Circassian walnut, with tables and furniture to harmonize.From the
mezzanine he saw the grand stairway falling away in great, sweeping
curves, all in blended marble from the world's greatest quarries, and
delicately chased and carved into classic designs.Two tapestries,
centuries old, hung from the walls on either side.Far above, the oak
ceiling, for which the _Schwarzwald_ had been ranged, was overlaid
with pure gold leaf.The whole was suffused with the glow of myriad
hidden and inverted lights, reflected in a thousand angles from
burnished gold and marble and rarest gems.He groped in the chambers of
his imagery for some superlative adjective to express his emotion
before this colossal display of wealth.But his ample vocabulary had
faded quite.He could only shake his head and give vent to the inept
remark, "Swell--by George!"The secretary, without replying, motioned them to follow.Passing
noiselessly around the balcony to the opposite side, she indicated a
door below, leading off to the right from the grand salon."That room beyond," she said, "is the petit salon.It is
in panels from French chateaux, covered with Gobelin tapestry.Now
from here you can see a bit of the music room.The grand organ cost,
installed, about two hundred thousand dollars.It is electrically
controlled, with its pipes running all around the room, so as to give
the effect of music coming from every corner.""There are three art galleries beyond, two for paintings, and one for
sculpture.Ames has without doubt the finest art collection in
America.It includes several Titians, Veroneses, da Vincis, Turners,
three Rubens, and two Raphaels.By the way, it may interest you to
know that his negotiations for the Murillo Madonna were completed
to-day, and the picture will be sent to him immediately.""Might I ask what he paid for it?""You may say that he paid something over three hundred thousand
dollars for it," she replied, in a quite matter of fact tone."Now,"
she continued, "you will go back to your first position, near the door
of the waiting room, and remain there until I return.I may have an
opportunity later to show you the library.Great
carved stone fireplace, taken from a Scotch castle.Hundreds of rare
volumes and first editions.Now, if any one approaches, you can step
behind the screen and remain out of view.You have chairs and a table
there for your writing.With this final injunction she turned and disappeared into the little
waiting room from which they had emerged.For some moments Carmen and Haynerd stood looking alternately at
each other and about them at their magnificent environment.Both had
seen much of the gilded life, and the girl had dwelt some months in
its alien atmosphere.But neither had ever witnessed such a
stupendous display of material wealth as was here unfolded before
their astonished gaze.At the head of the grand stairway stood the
Ames trio, to receive their resplendent guests.The women were
magnificently gowned.But Ames's massive form in its simple black
and chaste linen was the cynosure of all eyes.Even Haynerd could
not suppress a note of admiration as he gazed at the splendid figure."And yet," he murmured, "a victim, like the rest, of the great
delusion."Carmen laid down the opera glasses through which she had been studying
the man."He is an expression," she said, "of the American ideal--the
ideal of practical material life.It is toward his plane of life that
this country's youth are struggling, at, oh, what a cost!Think,
think, what his immense, misused revenue could do, if unselfishly
used!Why, the cost of this single night's show would put two hundred
men like Father Waite through a four-year course in the University,
and train them to do life's work!"Oh, further opportunities to increase his pile, I suppose," returned
Haynerd, shrugging his shoulders.And does he need further
opportunities to accumulate money?Does he not rather need some one to
show him the meaning of life, how to really live?"And it may be your mission, Carmen, to do just that.But if you don't, then I sincerely hope the man may die before he
discovers that all that he has achieved, his wealth, his prestige, his
power, have not been worth striving for!""He hasn't the slightest idea of the meaning of life," she murmured,
looking down upon the glittering throng."They put me in mind of Carlyle's famous remark, as
he stood looking out across the London Strand: 'There are in this city
some four million people, mostly fools.'How mean, narrow and hard
their lives are!These are the high priests of vested privilege, of
mediaevalism, of old institutions whose perpetual maintenance, even in
a generation that has progressed far beyond them, is a fungus blight
upon us.Ah, there's little Willie Van Wot, all dolled out!He's
glorifying his Creator now by devoting his foolish little existence to
coaching trips along the New England shore.He reminds me of the Fleet
street poet who wrote a century ago of the similar occupation of a
young dandy of that day--

                  What can little T. O. do?Why, drive a Phaeton and Two!!!Can little T. O. do no more?Yes, drive a Phaeton and Four!!!!"He's an interesting outgrowth of our unique social system, eh?""We must follow Emerson and treat them all as we do pictures, look at
them in the best light," murmured Carmen."Aye, hang them in the best light!""But make sure
they're well hung!There goes the pseudo-princess, member of the royal
house of England.I tell you, under
the splash and glitter you can see the feet of clay, eh?""Yes," smiled Carmen, "resting upon the high heel."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture of disgust."The women of
fashion seem to feel that the Creator didn't do a good job when He
designed the feminine sex--that He should have put a hump where the
heel is, so's to slant the foot and make comfortable walking
impossible, as well as to insure a plentiful crop of foot-troubles and
deformities.The Chinese women used to manifest a similarly insane
thought.The human mind is a cave
of black ignorance!"Carmen did not reply, but bent her attention again to the throng
below."Look there," said Haynerd, indicating a stout, full-toiletted woman,
resplendent with diamonds."That's our eminent French guest, Madam
Carot.She severed herself from her tiresome consort last year by
means of a bichloride tablet deftly immersed in his coffee, and then,
leaving a sigh of regret hovering over his unhandsome remains,
hastened to our friendly shores, to grace the _beau monde_ with her
gowns and jewels."Carmen turned to him with a remonstrance of incredulity."The Social Era got the whole spicy
story.See, she's drifted up to young Watson!Coquetting for a
husband still, the old buzzard!""Well, it's fact, anyway," persisted the society monitor."And there
beyond her is fat little Mrs.Stuffenheimer, with her two unlovely,
red-faced daughters.Ah, the despairing mamma is still vainly angling
for mates for her two chubby Venuses!If they're not married off
properly and into good social positions soon, it's mamma for the scrap
heap!it's positively tragic to see these anxious mothers
at Newport and Atlantic City and other fashionable places, rushing
madly hither and yon with their marriageable daughters, dragging them
from one function to another in the wild hope that they may ultimately
land a man.Worry and pain dig deep furrows into poor mamma's face if
she sees her daughters fading into the has-been class.It requires
heroism, I say, to travel in society!Well,"
taking up his notebook, "we must get busy now.By the way, how's your
shorthand progressing?""Oh, splendidly," replied the girl, her eyes still upon the massive
figure of Ames.Then, recovering from her abstraction, "I can write as
fast in it now as in longhand."For more than an hour the two sat in the seclusion of the splendid
balcony, looking down upon the scene of magnificence below.Through
the mind of the young girl ran a ceaseless paean of thanksgiving for
her timely deliverance from the trammels which she so well knew
enshackled these glittering birds of paradise.With it mingled a
great, consuming desire, a soul-longing to pour into the vacuity of
high society the leaven of her own pure thought.In particular did her
boundless love now go out to that gigantic figure whose ideals of life
this sumptuous display of material wealth and power expressed.Was it only a vainglorious
exhibition of his own human prowess?Was it an announcement,
magnificent beyond compare, that he, J. Wilton Ames, had attained the
supreme heights of gratified world ambition?That the world at last
lay at his feet?And that over it brooded the giant's lament that
there remained nothing more to conquer?But, if so, the girl at least
knew that the man's herculean efforts to subdue the material world
were as nothing.The real conquest lay still before him, the conquest
of self.And when that were faced and achieved, well she knew that no
such garish display as this would announce the victory to a breathless
world.The bustling little social secretary again appeared, and briefly
announced the production of an opera in the auditorium, to which she
had come to conduct them.Passing through the little waiting room and
to the elevator, they quickly mounted to the unoccupied gallery of the
theater above.The parquet, which would seat nearly a thousand
spectators, was rapidly filling with an eager, curious throng.The
Ames trio and some of the more distinguished guests were already
occupying the gorgeously decorated boxes at the sides.An orchestra of
fifty pieces was visible in the hollow below the stage.Caroni, the
famous grand opera leader, stood ready to conduct.The opera itself
was the much discussed music drama, Salome."Now," commented Haynerd to his fair, wondering companion, who was
lost in contemplation of the magnificent mural decorations of the
little theater, "we will see something rare, for this opera has been
called the most artistic piece of indecency known to the stage.Ames has got Marie Deschamps for the title role.She'll cost
him not less than five thousand dollars for this one night.And--see
here," drawing Carmen's attention to the bill, "Marcou and Corvalle
besides!These stars get three thousand
dollars a night during the regular season."Every phase of sophistication was manifested in that glittering
audience when the curtain rose and the sensational theme was
introduced.But to none came thoughts like those which clamored for
admittance at the portals of Carmen's mentality.In the bold challenge
of the insanely sensual portrayal of a carnal mind the girl saw the
age-old defiance of the spirit by the flesh.In the rolls of the
wondrous music, in its shrieks, its pleadings, and its dying echoes,
she heard voiced again the soul-lament of a weary world searching
vainly in the mazes of human thought for truth.As the wonderful
Deschamps danced weirdly before her in the ghastly light and fell
gloating over her gory trophy, Carmen saw but the frantic struggles of
a diseased soul, portrayed as the skilled surgeon lays bare the
malignant growth that is eating the quivering tissues of a human
frame.The immodesty of dress, the sensual suggestiveness of the
dance, the brutal flouting of every element of refinement and
delicacy, blazoned in frenzied tone and movement the bloody orgy and
dance of death which goes on incessantly upon the stage of human life,
and ends in the mad whirl and confusion and insane gibbering over the
lifeless trophies for which mankind sell their very souls.commented Haynerd, when the final
curtain dropped."Yes, even to a vitiated taste.The passionate thirst
for the sensational has led to this sickening display of salacity--"

"Splendid, wasn't it?"came in tones of admiration from the social
secretary, who had returned to conduct her charges back to the balcony
before the guests emerged from the theater."You will run the program
in full, and comment at some length on the expense attached," she went
on."You have just witnessed the private production of a full opera,
unabridged, and with the regular operatic cast.Supper will follow in
a half hour.Meantime, you will remain in the balcony where you were
before."Returning to their former position, Carmen sank into a chair at the
little table behind the screen, and strove to orient her thought.Haynerd sat down beside her to arrange his voluminous notes.Presently
footsteps were heard, and the sound of voices.Haynerd glanced through
the hinge of the screen.he whispered, "here comes Ames
and--who's with him?Showing him about, I
suppose."Carmen gazed at the approaching men with fascinated eyes, although she
saw but one, the towering magician who had reared this fairy palace.She saw Ames lead his companion to the door of the little waiting room
at their right, and heard the congressman protest against entering."But we can talk undisturbed in here," urged Ames, his hand on the
door."Better remain out here on the balcony," replied the congressman
nervously, as he moved toward the railing.He understood the
man's repugnance fully."You know, Wales," he said easily, going to the railing and peering
over at the brilliant assemblage below, "if I could get the heathen
Chinee to add an extra half-inch to his shirt length, I'd make a
hundred millions.And then, perhaps, I wouldn't need to struggle with
your Ways and Means Committee as I do.By the way, the cotton schedule
will be reported out unchanged, I presume."He turned and looked
quizzically at his companion as he said this.Wales trembled slightly when he replied to the question he had been
awaiting."Parsons will vote for it," he said
suggestively.Ames, is committed to
the high tariff principle.We can not let in a flood of foreign
cotton--"

"Then you want the fight between the farmers and spinners to continue,
eh?""You don't seem to realize that in the
end both will get more money than they are getting now, and that it
will come from the consumer, who will pay vastly higher for his
finished products, in addition to the tariff.Ames," returned the congressman
tenaciously."Look here, Wales," said Ames, turning savagely upon his companion.Their
cooeperative associations must be smashed.The tariff schedule which
you have before your Committee will do it.Ames," replied the congressman, "I--I am opposed to the constant
manipulation of cotton by you rich men.I--"

"There," interrupted Ames, "never mind explaining your conscientious
scruples.What I want to know is, do you intend to cast your vote for
the unaltered schedule?"Ames, I can't--"

"H'm," murmured Ames.Then, with easy nonchalance, turning to an
apparently irrelevant topic as he gazed over the railing, "I heard
just before coming from my office this evening that the doors of the
Mercantile Trust would not open to-morrow.A lot of my
personal friends are heavily involved.Ames and Company will take over their tangible assets; I believe
you were interested, were you not?"He glanced at the trembling man
out of the corners of his eyes.His hands shook as he grasped the railing before
him and tried to steady himself."It--it--yes--very hard," murmured the dazed man.But step into the waiting room and 'phone the newspapers.Representative Wales was serving his first term in Congress.His
election had been a matter of surprise to everybody, himself included,
excepting Ames.Wales knew not that his detailed personal history had
been for many months carefully filed in the vaults of the Ames tower.Nor did he ever suspect that his candidacy and election had been
matters of most careful thought on the part of the great financier
and his political associates.But when he, a stranger to congressional
halls, was made a member of the Ways and Means Committee, his
astonishment overleaped all bounds.Then Ames had smiled his own
gratification, and arranged that the new member should attend the
formal opening of the great Ames palace later in the year.Meantime,
the financier and the new congressman had met on several occasions,
and the latter had felt no little pride in the attention which the
great man had shown him.And so the path to fame had unrolled steadily before the guileless
Wales until this night, when the first suspicions of his thraldom had
penetrated and darkened his thought.Then, like a crash from a clear
sky, had come the announcement of the Mercantile Trust failure.And as
he stood there now, clutching the marble railing, his thought busy
with the woman and the two fair children who would be rendered
penniless by this blow, the fell presence of the monster Ames seemed
to bend over him as the epitome of ruthless, brutal, inhuman cunning."How much are you likely to lose by this failure?""Not less than fifty thousand
dollars," he replied in a husky voice.stooping and apparently taking up an object that had
been lying on the floor back of the congressman.Wales took the book in a dazed, mechanical way."Why--I have no--this
is not mine," he murmured, gazing alternately at the pass book and at
Ames."Your name's on it, at least," commented Ames laconically."And the
book's been issued by our bank, Ames and Company.Guess you've
forgotten opening an account there, let me see, yes, a week ago."He
took the book and opened it."Ah, yes, I recall the incident now.The book, made out in his name on Ames
and Company, showed a deposit to his credit of fifty thousand
dollars!Ames slipped his arm through the confused congressman's, and started
with him down the balcony."You see," he said, as they moved away,
"the Mercantile failure will not hit you as hard as you thought.Now,
about that cotton schedule, when you cast your vote for it, be sure
that--" The voice died away as the men disappeared in the distance,
leaving Carmen and Haynerd staring blankly at each other."We must save them both," said Carmen quietly."I could make my everlasting fortune out of this!"exclaimed Haynerd
excitedly."And lose your soul," replied the girl.Ames, and
tell him that we overheard his conversation.Haynerd then smiled, but it was a hard smile, coming from one who knew
the world."Listen, my dear girl," he said, "we will keep quiet, you
and I. To mention this would be only to court disaster at the hands of
one who would strangle us at the slightest intimation of our
knowledge."I can see but the right," returned Carmen determinedly."But, my dear girl," cried Haynerd, now thoroughly alarmed both for
himself and her, "he would ruin us!We had
no intention of hearing; and so let it be as if we had not heard."Haynerd, I could not, if I
would.Ames is being used by evil; and it is making him a channel
to ruin Mr.Shall I stand idly by and permit it?She rose, with a look of fixed resolution on her face.Haynerd sprang
to his feet and laid a detaining hand upon her arm.As he did so, the
screen was quickly drawn aside, and Kathleen Ames and two of her young
companions bent their curious gaze in upon them.Absorbed in their
earnest conversation, Carmen and Haynerd had not heard the approach of
the young ladies, who were on a tour of inspection of the house before
supper."Reporters for the Social Era, Miss Ames," explained Haynerd, hastily
answering the unspoken question, while he made a courteous bow.she cried, instantly
recognizing Carmen, and drawing back.asked one of the young ladies, as her eyes roved
over Carmen's tense, motionless figure.cried Kathleen, spurting her venom at Carmen, while
her eyes snapped angrily and her hands twitched."When the front door
is closed against you, you sneak in through the back door!Leave this
house, instantly, or I shall have you thrown into the street!""She is a low, <DW64> wench!"She foisted herself upon society, and was discovered
and kicked out!Her father is a dirty <DW64> priest, and her mother a
low--"

Haynerd rushed to the maddened girl and clapped his hand over her
mouth."Hush, for God's sake, Miss Ames!"Then, to her companions,
"Take her away!"But a house detective, attracted by the loud conversation, had come up
and interposed."I can not put them out if they have his
permission to remain," he explained to the angry Kathleen.In a few moments, during which the little group stood tense and quiet,
Ames himself appeared.turning inquiringly to Haynerd.Her article in last week's Social Era was a corker.But,"
staring from Kathleen to the others, "what's the row?""I want that creature put out of the house!"demanded Kathleen,
trembling with rage and pointing to Carmen."Tut, tut," returned Ames easily."She's on business, and has my
permission to remain.that's a good joke," winking at
Haynerd and breaking into a loud laugh."You put one over on us there,
old man!"Scalding tears of anger and humiliation were streaming down
Kathleen's face."If she remains, I shall go--I shall leave the
house--I will not stay under the same roof with the lewd creature!""Very well, then, run along," said Ames, taking the humiliated
Kathleen by the shoulders and turning her about."I will settle this
without your assistance."Then he motioned to the house detectives to
depart, and turned to Haynerd and Carmen."Come in here," he said,
leading the way to the little waiting room, and opening the door.but you belong down stairs with the rest," he ejaculated as he
faced Carmen, standing before him pale but unafraid."There isn't one
down there who is in your class!"he exclaimed, placing his hands upon
her shoulders and looking down into her beautiful face."And," he
continued with sudden determination, "I am going to take you down, and
you will sit at the table with me, as my special guest!"A sudden fear gripped Haynerd, and he started to interpose.An expression of surprise and inquiry came into Ames's face."You mean Congressman--"

Then he stopped abruptly, and looked searchingly at Carmen and her
companion.Ames's expression
of surprise gave place to one dark and menacing."You were behind that screen when Congressman Wales and I--"

"Yes," returned Carmen calmly.Ames stood like a huge, black cloud, glowering down upon the slender
girl."You are going to tell him that the fifty thousand dollars are just a
loan, and that he may vote as he chooses, aren't you?""You
will not ruin his life, and the lives of his wife and babies, will
you?You would never be happy, you know, if you did."Her voice was as
quiet as the morning breeze."You come into my house to play spy, eh?And
if I had not caught you when I did you would have written another
interesting article for the Social Era, wouldn't you?I'll
break you, Haynerd, and your infernal sheet into a million pieces if
you dare print any such rot as this!And as for you, young lady--"

"You can do nothing to me, Mr.Ames; and you don't really want to,"
said Carmen quickly."My reputation, you know--that is, the one which
you people have given me--is just as black as it could be, isn't it?"It doesn't really make any
difference to you, Mr.Ames," she said, "whether the cotton schedule
is passed or not.You still have your millions--oh, so much more
than you will ever know what to do with!Wales, he has his
wife and his babies and his good reputation--would you rob him of
those priceless treasures, just to make a few dollars more for
yourself?--dollars that you can't spend, and that you won't let
others have?"During the girl's quiet talk Ames was regaining his self-control.When
she concluded he turned to Haynerd."Miss Carmen can step out into the
balcony.You and I will arrange this matter together," he said."Now," said Ames significantly, and in a low voice, "what's your
price?"Instantly the girl turned back and threw herself between the two men.she cried, her eyes flashing as she confronted
Ames.shouted Ames, who had lost himself completely, "I will
crush him like a dirty spider!And you, I'll drag you through the
gutters and make your name a synonym of all that is vile in
womanhood!"Carmen stepped quietly to the elevator and pressed the signal button.cried the enraged Ames, starting
toward her.The girl drew herself up with splendid dignity, and faced him
fearlessly."We _shall_ leave your house, and now, Mr."You and that for which you stand can not touch us!The carnal
mind is back of you!She moved away from him, then turned and stood for a moment, flashing,
sparkling, radiant with a power which he could not comprehend.You are blinded and deceived by human lust and
greed.But the god you so ignorantly worship now will some day totter
and fall upon you.Then you will awake, and you will see your present
life as a horrid dream."Carmen and the dazed Haynerd stepped quickly
into it and descended without opposition to the lower floor.A few
moments later they were again in the street and hurrying to the
nearest car line."Girlie," said Haynerd, mopping the perspiration from his brow, "we're
in for it now--and I shall be crushed!But you--I think your God will
save you.""His arm is not shortened," she murmured, "that
He can not save us both."CHAPTER 5

ON the Monday morning following the Ames reception the society columns
of the daily papers still teemed with extravagant depictions of the
magnificent affair.On that same morning, while Haynerd sat gloomily
in the office of the Social Era, meditating on his giant adversary's
probable first move, Carmen, leaving her studies and classes, sought
out an unpretentious home in one of the suburbs of the city, and for
an hour or more talked earnestly with the timid, frightened little
wife of Congressman Wales.Then, her work done, she dismissed the
whole affair from her mind, and hastened joyously back to the
University."But," she
reflected, as she dwelt on his conduct and words of the previous
Saturday evening, "he is not ready for it yet.And when he is, I will
go to him.And Kathleen--well, I will help her by seeing only the real
child of God, which was hidden that night by the veil of hatred and
jealousy.And that veil, after all, is but a shadow."That evening the little group of searchers after God assembled again
in the peaceful precincts of the Beaubien cottage.It was their third
meeting, and they had come together reverently to pursue the most
momentous inquiry that has ever stimulated human thought.Haynerd and Carmen had said little relative to the Ames reception; but
the former, still brooding over the certain consequences of his brush
with Ames, was dejected and distraught.Carmen, leaning upon her
sustaining thought, and conceding no mite of power or intelligence to
evil, glowed like a radiant star.she asked of Haynerd, drawing him to one
side."Are you giving ear to the voices of evil, or good?For those thoughts which are real to you
will become outwardly manifested, you know."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture signifying
defeat."And the insults of that arrogant daughter of his--"

"She did not insult me," said Carmen quickly."She could not, for she
doesn't know me.She merely denounced her concept of me, and not my
real self.She vilified what she thought was Carmen Ariza; but it was
only her own thought of me that she insulted.And such
a concept of me as she holds deserves denouncing, doesn't it?""Well, what are we going to do?""We are going to know," she whispered, "that we two with God
constitute an overwhelming majority."She said nothing about her visit
to the Wales home that morning, but pressed his hand, and then went to
take her place at the table, where Father Waite was already rapping
for order."My friends," began that earnest young man, looking lovingly about at
the little group, "as we are gathered here we symbolize that
analytical, critical endeavor of the unbiased human mind to discover
the essence of religion.Religion is that which binds us to absolute
truth, and so is truth itself.If there is a God, we believe from our
former investigations that He must be universal mind.This belief
carries with it as necessary corollaries the beliefs that He must be
perfect, eternal, and self-existent.must
then receive its sufficient answer in the staggering statement that He
has always existed, unchanged and unchangeable."A sigh from Haynerd announced that quizzical soul's struggle to grasp
a statement at once so radical and stupendous."True," continued Father Waite, addressing himself to his doubting
friend, "the acceptance as fact of what we have deduced in our
previous meetings must render the God of orthodox theology quite
obsolete.But, as a compensation, it gives to us the most enlarged and
beautiful concept of Him that we have ever had.It ennobles, broadens,
purifies, and elevates our idea of Him.It destroys forever our
belittling view of Him as but a magnified human character, full of
wrath and caprice and angry threats, and delighting in human
ceremonial and religious thaumaturgy.And, most practical of all for
us, it renders the age-long problem of evil amenable to solution."Just then came a ring at the front door; and a moment later the
Beaubien ushered Doctor Morton into the room.All rose and hastened to
welcome him."I--I am sure," began the visitor, looking at Carmen, "that I am not
intruding, for I really come on invitation, you know.Miss Carmen,
first; and then, our good friend Hitt, who told me this afternoon that
you would probably meet this evening.I--I pondered the matter some
little time--ah, but--well, to make it short, I couldn't keep away
from a gathering so absolutely unique as this--I really couldn't."she exclaimed, her eyes dancing,
"I am glad you came.""And I, too," interposed Haynerd dryly, "for now we have two
theological Philistines."Ah, my friend," replied the doctor, "I am simply an advocate of
religious freedom, not a--"

"And religious freedom, as our wise Bill Nye once said, is but the art
of giving intolerance a little more room, eh?"returned Haynerd with a
laugh."You are a Philistine," he said.Carmen took the doctor by the arm and led him to a place beside her at
the table."You--you didn't bring poor Yorick?"she whispered, with a
glint of mischief in her bright eyes."No," laughed the genial visitor, "he's a dead one, you told me.""Yes," replied the girl, "awfully dead!He is an outward manifestation
of dead human beliefs, isn't he?But now listen, Father Waite is going
to speak."After a brief explanation to the doctor of the purpose of the
meeting, and a short resume of their previous deductions, Father Waite
continued the exposition of his subject."The physical universe," he said, "is to human beings a reality.And
yet, according to Spencer's definition of reality, we must admit that
the universe as we see it is quite unreal.For the real is that which
endures.""And you mean to say that the universe will not endure?""The phenomena of the universe, even as
we see it, are in a state of ceaseless change.Birth, growth,
maturity, decay, and death seems to be the law for all things
material."But," again urged Haynerd, "matter itself remains, is indestructible.""Our friend, Doctor Morton, will
corroborate my statement, I am sure.""It is quite true," he said in reply.The discovery, in the past few years, of the
tremendously important fact that matter disintegrates and actually
disappears, has revolutionized all physical science and rendered the
world's text books obsolete.""The radium atom, we find, lasts some
seventeen hundred years, or a trifle longer.What becomes of it when
it is destroyed?We can only say that it disappears from human
consciousness.""And so you reason that the whole material universe will ultimately
disappear from the human consciousness?""Yes," returned Hitt, "I feel certain of it.Let us consider of what
the universe consists.For many months I have been pondering this
topic incessantly.I find that I can agree, in a measure, with those
scientists who regard the physical universe as composed of only a few
elementary constituents, namely, matter, energy, space, and time--"

"Each one of these elements is mental," interrupted Carmen."And the physical universe, even from the
human standpoint, is, therefore, wholly mental.""No," interposed Father Waite; "we see only our mental concept of a
universe, for seeing is wholly a mental process."But now," resumed Hitt, "to get back to the supposed reality of the
physical universe, let us examine its constituents.First, let us
consider its unity established by the harmonious interplay of the
forces permeating it.This great fact is what led Herbert Spencer to
conclude that the universe could have but one creator, one ruler, and
that polytheism was untenable.""We are quite agreed regarding that," said Father Waite."If the
Creator is mind, He is of very necessity infinite and omnipotent;
hence there can be but one Creator."Would it exist, but as a convenience for the human mind?Is
it not really a creation of that mind?And, lastly, is it not merely a
mental concept?""Our consciousness of time," replied Carmen, "is only our awareness of
a continuous series of mental states.""That classifies it exactly," said Hitt, "and renders it wholly
mental."We are accustomed to say,
loosely, that space is that in which we see things about us.But in
what does the process of seeing consist?What I
really mean is that I am conscious of a chair.The process of seeing,
we are told, is this: light, coming from the chair, enters the eye and
casts an image of the chair upon the retina, much as a picture is
thrown upon the ground glass of a camera.Then, in some way, the
little rods and cones--the branching tips of the optic nerve which
project from the retina--are set in motion by the light-waves.This
vibration is in some mysterious manner carried along the optic nerve
to a center in the brain, and--well, then the mind becomes cognizant
of the chair out there, that's all.""Do you mean
to say," she queried, "that, after thousands of years of thought and
investigation, mankind now know nothing more than that about the
process of seeing?""Then all I've got to say," put in Haynerd, "is that the most
remarkable thing about you learned men is your ignorance!""I find it is only the fool who is cocksure," he
replied."Now," said Hitt, resuming the conversation, "let us go a step further
and inquire, first, What is light?since the process of seeing is
absolutely dependent upon it.""Light," offered the doctor, "is vibrations, or wave-motion, so
physicists tell us.""Light, we say, consists of vibrations.Not
vibrations of anything tangible or definitely material, but--well,
just vibrations in the abstract.Now
let us concede that these vibrations in some way get to the brain
center; and then let us ask, Is the mind there, in the brain, awaiting
the arrival of these vibrations to inform it that there is a chair
outside?"Haynerd indulged in a cynical laugh."It is too serious for laughter, my friend," said Hitt."For to such
crude beliefs as this we may attribute all the miseries of mankind.""Simply because these beliefs constitute the general belief in a
universe of matter without and about us.As a plain statement of fact,
_there is no such thing_.But, I ask again, Is the mind within the
brain, waiting for vibrations that will give it information concerning
the external world?Or does the mind, from some focal point without
the brain, look first at these vibrations, and then translate them
into terms of things without?Do these vibrations in some way suggest
form and color and substance to the waiting mind?Does the mind first
look at vibrating nerve-points, and then form its own opinions
regarding material objects?"No," admitted the doctor; "unless we believe that vibrations _per se_
are material.""Now I ask, Is the mind reduced to such slavery that it must depend
upon vibrations for its knowledge of an outside world?""And vibrations of minute pieces of flesh, at that!Flesh that
will some day decay and leave the mind helpless!""Why doesn't the mind look directly at
the chair, instead of getting its knowledge of the chair through
vibrations of bits of meat?Or isn't there any chair out there to look
at?""Now you've put your mental finger upon it.And now we are ready to nail to the cross of ignominy one of the
crudest, most insensate beliefs of the human race._The human mind
gets nothing whatsoever from vibrations, from the human, fleshly eye,
nor from any one of the five so-called physical senses!_ The physical
sense-testimony which mankind believe they receive from the eyes, the
ears, and the other sense organs, can, even at best, consist only of a
lot of disconnected, unintelligible vibrations; and anything that the
mind may infer from such vibrations is inferred _without any outside
authority whatsoever!ejaculated Miss Wall and Haynerd in a breath."And, further," continued Hitt, "we are forced to admit that all that
the mind knows is the contents of itself, of its own consciousness,
and nothing more.Then, instead of seeing, hearing, and feeling real
material objects outside of ourselves, we are in reality seeing,
hearing, and feeling our own mental concepts of things--in other
words, _our own thoughts of things!"_

A deep silence lay for some moments over the little group at the
conclusion of Hitt's words.Then Doctor Morton nodded his acquiescence
in the deduction."And that," he said, "effectually disposes of the
question of space.""There is no space, Doctor," replied Hitt.The human mind sees, hears, and feels nothing but its own
thoughts.These it posits within itself with reference to one another,
and calls the process'seeing material objects in space.'The mind as
little needs a space in which to see things as in which to dream them.I repeat, we do not see external things, or things outside of
ourselves.We see always and only the thoughts that are within our own
mentalities."That's why," murmured Carmen, "Jesus said, 'The kingdom of heaven is
within you.'""Did he not call evil, and all that originates
in matter, the lie about God?I tell you,
the existence of a world outside of ourselves, an objective world
composed of matter, is wholly inferred--it is mental visualizing--and
it is unreal, for it is not based upon fact, upon truth!""Then," queried Haynerd, "our supposed 'outer world' is but our
collection of thought-concepts which we hold within us, within our own
consciousness, eh?""We are ready for that again," replied Hitt."We have said that in the
physical universe all is in a state of incessant change.Since the
physical universe is but a mental concept to each one of us, we must
admit that, were the concept based upon truth, it would not change.Our concept of the universe must be without the real causative and
sustaining principle of all reality, else would it not pass away.And
yet, beneath and behind all these changes, _something_ endures.There is an enduring substance, invisible to human
sight, but felt and known through its own influence.But none of these things is in any sense
material.The material is the fleeting, human concept, composed of
thought that is _not_ based upon reality.These other things, wholly
mental, or spiritual, if you prefer, are based upon that'something'
which does endure, and which I will call the Causative Principle."I think," interposed Doctor Morton at this juncture, "that I can
throw some light upon the immaterial character of matter, if I may so
put it; for even our physical reasoning throws it entirely into the
realm of the mental."The doctor sat for some moments in a deep study.Then he began:

"The constitution of matter, speaking now from an admittedly
materialistic standpoint, that of the physical sciences, is a subject
of vastest interest and importance to mankind, for human existence
_is_ material."The ultimate constituent of matter has been called the atom.But we
have said little when we have said that.The atom was once defined as
a particle of matter so minute as to admit of no further division.That definition has gone to the rubbish heap, for the atom can now be
torn to pieces.But--and here is the revolutionary fact in modern
physical science--_it is no longer held necessary that matter should
consist of material particles!_ In fact, the great potential discovery
of our day is that matter is electrical in composition, that it is
composed of what are called 'electrons,' and that these electrons are
themselves composed of electric charges.It is without weight, bulk, dimensions, or
tangibility.Well, then, it comes dangerously near being a mental
thing, known to the human mind solely by its manifestations, does it
not?And of course our comprehension of it is entirely mental, as is
our comprehension of everything."He paused for a moment, that his words might be fully grasped.Then he
went on:

"Now these atoms, whatever they are, are supposed to join together to
form molecules.Why, it is--well, law, if you please.Then, going a step further,
molecules are held together by cohesion to form material objects,
chairs, trees, coal, and the like."But, Doctor--" interrupted Haynerd."Now we
have the very latest word from our physical scientists regarding the
constitution of matter: _it is composed of electric charges, held
together by law._ Again, you may justly ask: Is matter material--or
mental?"He paused again, and took up a book that lay before him."Here," he continued, "I hold a solid, material, lumpy thing,
composed, you will say, of matter.And yet, in essence, and if we can
believe our scientists, this book is composed of billions of electric
charges--invisible things, without form, without weight, without
color, without extension, held together by law, and making up a
material object which has mass, color, weight, and extension.From
millions of things which are invisible and have no size, we get an
object, visible and extended.""Yet, the doctor is giving the very latest
deductions of the great scientists.""But, Doctor," said Father Waite, "the scientists tell us that they
have experimental evidence in support of the theories which you have
stated regarding the composition of matter.Electricity has been
proven granular, or atomic, in structure.And every electrical
charge consists of an exact number of electrical atoms spread out
over the surface of the charged body."Admitted," said Hitt, taking up the challenge."And their very
calculations and deductions are rapidly wearing away the'materialistic
theory' of matter.You will admit that mathematics is wholly
confined to the realm of mind.It is a strictly mental science, in no
way material.It loses definiteness when 'practically' applied to
material objects.Kant saw this, and declared that a science might be
regarded as further removed from or nearer to perfection in proportion
to the amount of mathematics it contained.Now there has been an
astonishing confirmation of this great truth just lately.At a banquet
given in honor of the discoverer of wireless telegraphy it was stated
that the laws governing the traversing of space by the invisible
electric waves were more exact than the general laws of physics,
where very complex formulas and coefficients are required for
correcting the general laws, due to surrounding material conditions.The greater exactness of laws governing the invisible electric waves
was said to be due to the absence of matter.And it was further
stated that _whenever matter had to be taken into consideration there
could be no exact law of action!"That matter admits of no definite laws," replied Hitt."That there
are no real laws of matter.And that definiteness is attained only as
we dematerialize matter itself.""In other words, get into the realm of the mental?"I have said that we do not
receive any testimony whatsoever through the so-called material
senses, but that we see, hear, feel, taste, and smell our own
thoughts--that is, the thoughts which, from some source, come into our
mentalities.Very well, our scientists show us that, as they get
farther away from dense material thoughts, and deal more and more with
those which have less material structure, less material composition,
their laws become more definite, more exact.Following this out to its
ultimate conclusion, we may say, then, that _only those laws which
have to do with the non-material are perfect_.""And those," said Carmen, "are the laws of mind."And now the history of physical science shows that there has
been a constant deviation from the old so-called fixed 'laws of
matter.'The law of impenetrability has had to go.A great physicist
tells us that, when dealing with sufficiently high speeds, matter has
no such property as impenetrability.The law of indestructibility has had to go.Matter deteriorates and
goes to pieces.The decided
tendency of belief is toward a single element, of which all matter is
composed, and of which the eighty-odd constituent elements of matter
accepted to-day are but modifications.That unit element may be the
ether, of course.And the great Russian chemist, Mendeleef, so
believed.But to us, the ether is a mental thing, a theory.But,
granting its existence, _its universal penetrability renders matter,
as we know it, non-existent_.Everything reduces to the ether, in the
final analysis.And all energy becomes vibrations in and of the
ether.""And the ether," supplemented the doctor, "has to be without mass,
invisible, tasteless, intangible, much more rigid than steel, and at
the same time some six hundred billion times lighter than air, in
order to fulfill all the requirements made of it and to meet all
conditions.""Yes; and yet the ether is a very necessary theory, if we are going to
continue to explain the phenomena of force on a material basis.""Then," said Carmen, "matter reduces to what it really is, the human
mind's _interpretation_ of substance.""Yes," said Hitt, turning to her; "I think you are right; matter is
the way real substance--let us say, spirit--looks to the human
mentality.It is the way the human mind interprets its ideas of
spirit.In other words, the human mind looks at the material thoughts
and ideas which enter it, and calls them solid substance, occupying
space--calls them matter, with definite laws, and, in certain forms,
containing life and intelligence.""And that has been the terrible
mistake of the ages, the one great error, the one lie, that has caused
us all to miss the mark and come short, far short, of the glory of the
mind that is God._There is the origin of the problem of evil!_"

"Undoubtedly," replied Hitt."For evil is in essence but evil thought.The origin of
all evil is matter itself.And matter, we find, is but a mental
concept, a thing of thought."Well," put in Haynerd, who had been twitching nervously in his chair,
"let's get to the conclusion of this very learned discussion.I'm a
plain man, and I'd like to know just where we've landed.What have you
said that I can take home with me?The earth still revolves around the
sun, even if it is a mean mud ball.And I can't see that I can get
along with less than three square meals a day.""We have arrived," replied Hitt gravely, "at a most momentous
conclusion, deduced by the physical scientists themselves, namely,
that _things are not what they seem_.In other words, all things
material seem to reduce to vibrations in and of the ether; the basis
of all materiality is energy, motion, activity--mental things.All the
elements of matter seem to be but modifications of one all-pervading
element.That element is probably the ether, often called the'mother
of matter.'The elements, such as carbon, silicon, and the others, are
not elementary at all, but are forms of one universal element, the
ether.The so-called rare elements are
rare only because their lives are short.They disintegrate rapidly and
change into other forms of the universal element--or disappear.'Atoms
are but fleeting phases of matter,' we are told.They are by no means
eternal, even though they may endure for millions of years.""A great scientist of our own day," Hitt continued, "has said that
'the ether is so modified as to constitute matter, in some way.'Simply that 'visible matter and invisible ether are
one and the same thing.'But to the five so-called physical senses the
ether is utterly incomprehensible.So, then, matter is wholly
incomprehensible to the five physical senses.What is it, then, that
we call matter?It can be nothing more than the human mind's
interpretation of its idea of an all-pervading, omnipresent
_something_, a something which represents substance to it.""Let me add a further quotation from the great physical scientist to
whom you have referred," said the doctor."He has said that the ether
is _not_ matter, but that it is material.And further, that we can not
deny that the ether may have some mental and spiritual functions to
subserve in some other order of existence, as matter has in this.It
is wholly unrelated to any of our senses.The sense of sight takes
cognizance of it, but only in a very indirect and not easily
recognized way.And yet--stupendous conclusion!--_without the ether
there could be no material universe at all_!""In other words," said Hitt, "the whole fabric of the material
universe depends upon something utterly unrecognizable by the five
physical senses.""Then," concluded Hitt, "the physical senses give us no information
whatsoever of a real physical universe about us.""And so," added Father Waite, "we come back to Carmen's statement,
namely, that seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling are
mental processes, in no way dependent upon the outer fleshly organs of
sense--"

"Nonsense!""Why is it, then, that if the eyes
are destroyed we do not see?""Simply, my friend, because of human belief," replied Hitt."The human
mind has been trained for untold centuries to dependence upon beliefs
in the reality of matter, and beliefs in its dependence upon material
modes for sight, hearing, touch, and so on.It is because of its
erroneous beliefs that the human mind is to-day enslaved by matter,
and dependent upon it for its very sense of existence.The human mind
has made its sense of sight dependent upon a frail, pulpy bit of
flesh, the eye.As long as that fleshly organ remains intact, the
human mind sees its sense of sight externalized in the positing of its
mental concepts about it as natural objects.But let that fleshly eye
be destroyed, and the human mind sees its belief of dependence upon
the material eye externalized as blindness.When the fleshly eye is
gone the mind declares that it can no longer see.And what it declares
as truth, as fact, becomes externalized to it.I repeat, the human
mind sees and hears only its thoughts, its beliefs.And holding to
these beliefs, and making them real to itself, it eventually sees them
externalized in what it calls its outer world, its environment, its
universe.And yet, the materialistic scientists themselves show that
the human mind can take no cognizance whatever through the five
physical senses of the all-pervading basis of its very existence, the
ether.it is but a theory which we find necessary
for any intelligible explanation of the farce of human existence on a
material basis."retorted Haynerd, rising and giving expression to his
protest by means of emphatic gestures.You
tell me that the existence of things demands a creator, and I admit
it, for there can be no effect without a cause.Then you say that the
universe is infinite; and I admit that, too, for the science of
astronomy finds no limits to space, and no space unoccupied.You say
that the unity manifested in the universe proves that there can be but
one creator.Moreover, to create an infinite universe there must needs
be an omnipotent creator; and there can be but one who is omnipotent.Further, I can see how that creator must be
mind--infinite mind.And I can see why that mind must be absolutely
perfect, with no intelligence of evil whatsoever, else would it be a
house divided against itself.Now I admit that the universe must be the manifestation, the
expression, of that infinite creative mind.But--and here's the
sticking point--the universe is both good and evil!Hence, the mind
which it manifests is likewise both good and evil--and the whole
pretty theory blows up!"He sat down abruptly, with the air of having given finality to a
perplexing question.All eyes then turned to Carmen, who slowly rose and surveyed the
little group."It is not surprising," she said, smiling at the confused Haynerd,
"that difficulties arise when you attempt to reach God through human
reasoning--spirit through matter.You have taken the unreal, and,
through it, have sought to reach back to the real.""Well," interrupted Haynerd testily, "kindly explain the difference.""Then, first," replied Carmen, "let us adopt some common meeting
ground, some basis which we can all accept, and from which we can
rise.Are you all agreed that, in our every-day life, everything is
mental?--every action?--every object?--and that, as the philosopher
Mill said, 'Everything is a feeling of which the mind is conscious'?Let me illustrate my meaning," she continued, noting Haynerd's rising
protest."I see this book; I take it up; and drop it upon the table.No; I have been conscious of thoughts which
I call a book, nothing more.A real material book did not get into my
mind; but _thoughts_ of a book did.And the activity of such thought
resulted in a state of consciousness--for consciousness is mental
activity, the activity of thought.Remember that, even according to
your great physical scientists, this book is composed of millions of
charges of electricity, or electrons, moving at a tremendously high
rate of speed.And yet, regardless of its composition, I am conscious
only of my thoughts of the book.It is but my thoughts that I see,
after all."She paused and waited for the protest which was not voiced."Very well," she said, continuing; "so it is with the sense of touch;
I had the thought of touching it, and that thought I saw; I was
conscious of it when it became active in my mentality.So with sound;
when I let the book drop, I was conscious of my thought of sound.If
the book had been dropped in a vacuum I should not have been conscious
of a thought of sound--why?Hitt has told us, the
human mind has made its sense-testimony dependent upon vibrations.And
yet, there is a clock ticking up there on the wall."Yes," replied Haynerd; "now that you've called my attention to it.""You hear it when your thought is
directed to it.And yet the air was vibrating all the time, and, if
hearing is dependent upon the fleshly ear, you should have heard it
incessantly when you were not thinking of it, as well as you hear it
now when you are thinking of it."Well, perhaps so," assented Haynerd with some reluctance."We hear, see, and feel," continued the girl, "when our thought is
directed to these processes.And the processes are wholly mental--they
take place within our mentalities--and it is there, within our minds,
that we see, hear, and feel _all_ things.And it is there, within our
minds, that the universe exists for us.It is there that we hold our
world, our fleshly bodies, everything that we call material._The
universe that we think we see all about us consists of the mental
concepts, made up of thought, which we hold within our mentalities_."Carmen proceeded with the
exposition of her theme."Whence come these material thoughts that are within us?They are real to us, at any rate,
are they not?And if they are thoughts of pain and suffering and
death, they are terribly real to us.But let us see, now that we can
reason from the basis of the mental nature of all things.We have
agreed that the creative principle is mind, and we call it God.This
infinite mind constantly expresses and manifests itself in ideas.Why,
that is a fundamental law of mind!You express yourself in your ideas
and thoughts, which you try to externalize materially.But the
infinite mind expresses itself in an infinite number and variety of
ideas, all, like itself, pure, perfect, eternal, good, without any
elements or seeds of decay or discord.And the incessant expression of
the creative mind in and through its numberless ideas constitutes the
never-ending process of creation.""Let me add here," interrupted Hitt, "that the Bible states that God
created the heavens and earth in seven days.But numbers, we must
remember, were mystical things to the ancient Hebrews, and were
largely used symbolically.The number seven, for example, was used to
express wholeness, completeness.So we must remember that its use in
Genesis has a much wider meaning than its absurd theological
interpretation into seven solar days.As Carmen says, the infinite
creative mind can never cease to express itself; creation can never
cease; and creation is but the whole, complete revelation or
unfoldment of infinite mind's ideas.""And infinite mind," continued Carmen, "requires infinite time in
which to completely express itself.So time ceases to be, and we find
that all real things exist now, in an endless present.Now, the ideas
of infinite mind range throughout the realm of infinity, but the
greatest idea that the creative mind can have is the idea of itself.That idea is the image and likeness of the infinite creative mind.It
is the perfect reflection of that mind--its perfect expression.That
idea is what the man Jesus always saw back of the human concept of
man."That's quite a different proposition from
the mud-men that I do business with daily."If they were real," said Carmen, "they would have to be children of
God.But then they would not be'mud-men.'Now I have just spoken of
the real, the spiritual creation.That is the creation mentioned in
the first chapter of Genesis, where all was created--revealed,
unfolded--by God, and He saw that it was perfect, good.'In the
beginning,' says the commentator.That is, 'To begin with--God.'Everything begins with God in the realm of the real.And the creation, or unfoldment, is like its creative
principle, eternal and good.""But," persisted Haynerd, "how about the material man?""Having created all things spiritually," continued the girl, "was it
necessary that the creative mind should repeat its work, do it over
again, and produce the man of dust described in the second chapter of
Genesis?Is that second account of the creation an inspiration of
truth--or a human comment?""Call it what you will," said the cynical Haynerd; "the fact remains
that the mud-man exists and has to be reckoned with.""Both of your premises are wholly incorrect," returned the girl
gently."He does _not_ exist, excepting in human, mortal thought.He
is a product of only such thought.He and his material universe are
seen and dealt with only in such thought.And such thought is the
direct antithesis of God's thought.It is
the supposition, the lie, the mist that went up and darkened the
earth.""Is just what you have said, a hue of a man, a dark hue, the shadowy
opposite which seems to counterfeit the real, spiritual man and claim
all his attributes.He is not a compound of mind and matter, for we
have seen that all things are mental, even matter itself.He is a sort
of mentality, a counterfeit of real mind.His body and his universe
are in himself.And, like all that is unreal, he is transient,
passing, ephemeral, mortal.""No, for he does not exist, excepting in supposition.If so, then not even truth can destroy it.No, the human mind is the
'old man' of Paul.He is to be put off by knowing his nothingness, and
by knowing the unreality of his supposed material environment and
universe.As he goes out of consciousness, the real man, the idea of
God, perfect, harmonious, and eternal, comes in.""And there," said Father Waite impressively, "you have the whole
scheme of salvation, as enunciated by the man Jesus.""There is no doubt of it," added Hitt.how
futile, how base, how worse than childish now appear the whole
theological fabric of the churches, their foolish man-made dogmas,
their insensate beliefs in a fiery hell and a golden heaven.Oh, how
belittling now appear their concepts of God--a God who can damn
unbaptised infants, who can predestine his children to eternal sorrow,
who creates and then curses his handiwork!Do you wonder that sin,
sorrow, and death remain among us while such awful beliefs hold sway
over the human mind?Haynerd, who had been sitting quietly for some moments, deep in
thought, rose and held out his hands, as if in entreaty.It seems--it seems as if a curtain had been raised suddenly.And what I
see beyond is--"

Carmen went swiftly to the man and slipped an arm about him."That
infinite creative Mind, so misunderstood and misinterpreted by human
beings, is back of you," she whispered."But had I not seen the proof in you, no amount of reasoning would
have convinced me."And, bowing to the little group, he went out.said Hitt, turning inquiringly to the doctor."If these things are true," he made answer
slowly, "then I shall have to recast my entire mentality, my whole
basis of thinking.""It is just what you _must_ do, Doctor, if you would work out your
salvation," said Carmen."Jesus said we must repent if we would be
saved.Repentance--the Greek _metanoia_--means a complete and radical
change of thought.""But--do you mean to say that the whole world has been mistaken?That
the entire human race has been deceived for ages?""Why," said Hitt, "it was only in our own day, comparatively speaking,
that the human race was undeceived in regard to the world being round.And there are thousands of human beings to-day who still believe in
witchcraft, and who worship the sun and moon, and whose lives are
wholly under the spell of superstition.Human character, a great
scientist tells us, has not changed since history began.""But we can't revamp our thought-processes!""Then we must go on missing the mark, sinning, suffering, sorrowing,
and dying, over and over and over again, until we decide that we can
do so," said Hitt.The doctor looked at Carmen and met that same smile of unbounded love
which she gave without stint to a sin-weary world."I--I'll come again," he said."Yes," said Carmen, rising and coming around to him."And," in a
whisper, "bring Pat."CHAPTER 6


The Social Era had for many years made its weekly appearance every
Saturday morning, that its fashionable clientele might appease their
jaded appetites on the Sabbath day by nibbling at its spicy pabulum.But, though the Ames reception had fallen on a Saturday night, the
following Friday morning found the columns of the Era still awaiting
a report of the notable affair.Whenever he set his pen to the task, there loomed before him only the
scene in the little waiting room, and he could write of nothing else.He found himself still dwelling upon the awful contrast between the
slender wisp of a girl and her mountainous opponent, as they had stood
before him; and the terrifying thoughts of what was sure to follow in
consequence drenched his skin with cold perspiration.On the desk before him lay the essay which he had asked Carmen to
write during the week, as her report of the brilliant event.He had
read it through three times, and each time had read into it a new
meaning.Not that it ridiculed or condemned--at
least, not openly--but because every one of its crisp comments
admitted of an interpretation which revealed the hidden depths of the
social system, and its gigantic incarnation, as if under the glare of
a powerful searchlight.It was in no sense a muck-raking exposition.Rather, it was an interpretation, and a suggestion.It was, too, a
prediction; but not a curse.The girl loved those about whom she
wrote.And yet, he who read the essay aright would learn that her love
stopped not at the flimsy veil of the flesh, but penetrated until it
rested upon the fair spiritual image beyond.And then Haynerd saw that
the essay was, in substance, a social clinic, to which all searchers
after truth were bidden, that they might learn a great lesson from her
skillful dissection of the human mind, and her keen analysis of its
constituent thought.As he sat wrapped in reflection, the early morning mail was brought
in.He glanced up, and then started to his feet.The letters spread
over his desk like an avalanche of snow; and the puffing mail carrier
declared that he had made a special trip with them alone.Haynerd
began to tear them open, one after another.Then he called the office
boy, and set him at the task.There were more than five hundred of
them, and each contained a canceled subscription to the Social Era.A dark foreboding settled down over Haynerd's mind.He rose and went
to the card-index to consult his subscription list.He
stood confusedly for a moment, then hastened to the window that looked
out upon a fire-escape.He turned
and rushed to the vault, which, reflecting his own habitual
carelessness, was never locked.His ledgers and account books were not
there.Then he crept back to his desk and sank into a chair.The noon mail brought more letters of like nature, until the office
boy tallied nearly eight hundred.Then Haynerd, as if rousing from a
dream, reached for the telephone and summoned Hitt to his rescue.Its mailing list had contained some
fifteen hundred names.The subscription price was twelve dollars a
year--and never, to his knowledge, had it been paid in advance by his
ultra-rich patrons, most of whom were greatly in arrears.Haynerd saw
it all vanishing now as quietly as the mist fades before the summer
sun.Within an hour the wondering Hitt was in conference with him, and
Haynerd had told the story of the theft, of the Ames bribe, and the
encounter following."But," he cried, "can Ames kill my entire
subscription list, and in a single week?""Easily," replied Hitt, "and in any one of several ways.Apparently he
had caused your subscription list and books to be stolen.Or, rather, Ames has lifted it bodily from the sky."Carmen
and I saw him bribe Wales!"Forget all that," he said, laying a hand on the excited
man's arm."Remember, that Wales would never dare breathe a word of
it; Carmen has no reputation or standing whatsoever now in this city;
and Ames would make out a case of blackmail against you so quickly
that it would sweep you right into the Tombs.And first, let
us get the girl herself down here."He took the telephone and called up several of the University
departments, after first ascertaining that she was not at her home.Then, having located her, he plunged into a study of the situation
with the distracted publisher."Here I waste my
evenings in learned philosophical discussions with you people, and
meantime, while we're figuring out that there is no evil, that
monster, Ames, stretches out a tentacle and strangles me!Fine
practical discussions we've been having, ain't they?I tell you, I'm
through with 'em!"He brought his fist down upon the desk with a
crash."Ned," said Hitt, "you're a fool."Here I had a nice, clean
business, no work, good pay--and, just because I associated with you
and that girl, the whole damn thing goes up the flue!Pays to be good,
doesn't it?"H'm; well, Ned, you're not only a fool, but a blooming idiot,"
replied Hitt calmly."And if you run out of
epithets, I'll supply a few!I'm a--"

The door swung open, and Carmen entered, fresh as the sea breeze, and
panting with her haste."Do you know," she began eagerly, "two men
followed me all the way down from the University!They watched me
come in here, and--but, what is wrong with you two?"She stopped and
looked inquiringly from one to the other."Well," began Hitt hesitatingly, "we were reflecting--"

"Reflecting?"We were just holding a wake, that's all," muttered Haynerd.Hitt pushed out a chair for the girl, and bade her sit down.Then he
briefly related the events which had led to her being summoned."And
now," he concluded, "the question is, does Wales know that you and Ned
saw Ames try to bribe him?""I did--last Monday morning, early," answered the wondering girl.ejaculated Haynerd, turning upon Hitt and waving
his arms about."What do you--"

"Hold your tongue, Ned!"Then, to Carmen, "Why did
you tell her?""Why--to save her, and her husband, and babies!"But, to save them, you have ruined Ned," pursued Hitt.The girl turned to Haynerd, who sat doubled up in his chair, the
picture of despair.It was the first time
she had used this name in addressing him.And if you have been pushed out of this business, it is because
it isn't fit for you, and because you've been awakened.You are for
higher, better things than the publishing of such a magazine as the
Social Era.I knew you just couldn't stay at this work.You have got
to go up--"

"Eh!"Haynerd had roused out of his torpor.Yes, I've gone up,
nicely!And I was making ten thousand dollars a year out of it!"I wasn't speaking of money," she said."When I talk, it's in dollars and
cents!""And that's why your talk is mostly nonsense," put in Hitt."The
girl's right, I guess.You've stagnated here long enough, Ned.There's
no such thing as standing still."You now have a grand opportunity," said Carmen, taking his hand."Yes; every trial in this life is an opportunity to prove that there
is no evil," she said."Listen; you have been trained as a publisher.Very well, the world is waiting for the right kind of publications.Oh, I've seen it for a long, long time.The demand is simply
tremendous.Haynerd looked confusedly from Carmen to Hitt."What, exactly, do you mean, Carmen?""Let him publish now a clean magazine, or paper; let him print real
news; let him work, not for rich people's money, but for all people.Why, the press is the greatest educator in the world!But, oh, how it
has been abused!Now let him come out boldly and stand for clean
journalism.Let him find his own life, his own good, in service for
others.""But, Carmen," protested Hitt, "do the people want clean journalism?"It could, if it had the right thought back of it," returned the
confident girl.Haynerd had again lapsed into sulky silence.But Hitt pondered the
girl's words for some moments.She was not the first nor the only one
who had voiced such sentiments.He himself had even dared to hold the
same thoughts, and to read in them a leading that came not from
material ambitions.Then, of a sudden, an idea flamed up in his mind.Hitt's eyes widened with his expanding
thought."Carlson, editor of the Express, wants to sell," he
continued, speaking rapidly."It's a semi-weekly newspaper, printed only for country circulation;
has no subscription list," commented Haynerd, with a cynical shrug of
his shoulders.The abruptness of the strange, apparently irrelevant question
startled the girl."Why," she replied slowly, "as old as--as God."And, as human beings reckon time, eighteen, eh?"Hitt then turned to
Haynerd."How much money can you scrape together, if you sell this lot
of junk?"he asked, sweeping the place with a glance."Five or six thousand, all told, including bank account, bonds, and
everything, I suppose," replied Haynerd mechanically."Carlson wants forty thousand for the Express.I'm not a rich man, as
wealth is estimated to-day, but--well, oil is still flowing down in
Ohio.It isn't the money--it's--it's what's back of the cash."Carmen reached over and laid a hand on his arm."We can do it," she
whispered.Hitt hesitated a moment longer, then sprang to his feet."I've pondered and studied this scheme for a year,
but I've only to-day seen the right help.That is your tremendous,
driving thought," he said, turning to Carmen."That thought is a
spiritual dynamite, that will blast its way through every material
obstacle!Ned," seizing Haynerd by the shoulder and shaking him out of
his chair, "rouse up!Now I'll 'phone Carlson
right away and make an appointment to talk business with him.Haynerd blinked for a few moments, like an owl in the light.But then,
as a comprehension of Hitt's plan dawned upon his waking thought, he
straightened up.The clientele of the Express will not be made up
of his puppets!"But--your University work, Hitt?""I was only biding my time," she replied gently.Tears began to trickle slowly down Haynerd's cheeks, as the tension in
his nerves slackened.He rose and seized the hands of his two friends."Hitt," he said, in a choking voice, "I--I said I was a fool.The real man has waked up, and--well, what are you
standing there for, you great idiot?*       *       *       *       *

Again that evening the little group sat about the table in the dining
room of the Beaubien cottage.But only the three most directly
concerned, and the Beaubien, knew that the owner of the Express had
received that afternoon an offer for the purchase of his newspaper,
and that he had been given twenty-four hours in which to accept it.Doctor Morton was again present; and beside him sat his lifelong
friend and jousting-mate, the very Reverend Patterson Moore.Hitt
took the floor, and began speaking low and earnestly."We must remember," he said, "in conjunction with what we have deduced
regarding the infinite creative mind and its manifestations, that we
mortals in our daily mundane existence deal only and always with
phenomena, with appearances, with effects, and never with ultimate
causes.And so all our material knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only.Of the ultimate essence of things, the human mind
knows nothing.A phenomenon may be
so-and-so with regard to another; but that either is absolute truth we
can not affirm.And yet--mark this well--as Spencer says, 'Every one
of the arguments by which the relativity of our knowledge is
demonstrated distinctly postulates the positive existence of something
beyond the relative.'""It is a primitive statement of what is sometimes called the 'Theory
of suppositional opposites'", replied Hitt."It means that to every
reality there is the corresponding unreality.For every truth there
may be postulated the supposition.We can not, as the great
philosopher says, conceive that our knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only, without at the same time conceiving a reality of
which they are appearances.He further amplifies this by saying that
'every positive notion--the concept of a thing by what it is--suggests
a negative notion--the concept of a thing by what it is not.But,
though these mutually suggest each other, _the positive alone is
real_.'For, interpreted, it means: we
must deny the seeming, or that which appears to human sense, in order
to see that which is real."exclaimed Miss Wall, glancing about to note the
effect of the speaker's words on the others.But Carmen nodded her thorough agreement, and added: "Did not Jesus
say that we must deny ourselves?Why, the self that
appears to us, the matter-man, the dust-man, the man of the second
chapter of Genesis.We must deny his reality, and know that he is
nothing but a mental concept, formed out of suppositional thought, out
of dust-thought."Undoubtedly correct," said Hitt, turning to Carmen."But, before we
consider the astonishing teachings of Jesus, let us sum up the
conclusions of philosophy.To begin with, then, there is a First
Cause, omnipotent and omnipresent, and of very necessity perfect.That
Cause lies back of all the phenomena of life; and, because of its real
existence, there arises the suppositional existence of its opposite,
its negative, so to speak, which is unreal.The phenomena of human
existence have to do _only_ with the suppositional existence of the
great First Cause's opposite.They are a reflection of that
supposition.Hence all human knowledge of an external world is but
phenomenal, and consists of appearances which have no more real
substance than have shadows._We, as mortals, know but the shadowy,
phenomenal existence._ _We do not know reality._ _Therefore, our
knowledge is not real knowledge, but supposition._

"Now," he went on hastily, for he saw an expression of protest on
Reverend Moore's face, "we are more or less familiar with a phenomenal
existence, with appearances, with effects; and our knowledge of these
is entirely mental.These thoughts, such
as feeling, seeing, hearing, and so on, we ignorantly attribute to the
five physical senses.This is what Ruskin calls the 'pathetic
fallacy.'And because we do so, we find ourselves absolutely dependent
upon these senses--in belief.Moreover, quoting Spencer again, only
the absolutely real is the absolutely persistent, or enduring.The truth of the multiplication table will endure
eternally."No," admitted Miss Wall, speaking for the others."And, as regards material objects which we seem to see and touch,"
went on Hitt, "we appear to see solidity and hardness, and we conceive
as real objects what are only the mental signs or indications of
objects.Remember, matter does not and can not get into the mind.Only
thoughts and ideas enter our mentalities.We see our _thoughts_ of
hardness, solidity, and so on; and these thoughts point to something
that is real.I repeat: _the ideas of the
infinite creative Mind_.The thoughts of size, shape, hardness, and so
on, which we group together and call material chairs, trees,
mountains, and other objects, are but'relative realities,' pointing
to the absolute reality, infinite mind and its eternal ideas and
thoughts."But all seemed absorbed in his
statements.Then he resumed:

"Our concept of matter, which is now proven to be but a mental
concept, built up out of false thought, points to _mind_ as the real
substance.Our concept of measurable space and distance is the direct
opposite of the great truth that infinite mind is ever-present.Our
concept of time is the opposite of infinity.Age is the opposite of eternity--and the old-age thought
brings extinction.So, _to every reality there is the corresponding
unreality_.If the infinite creative
mind is good--and we saw that by very necessity it _must_ be so--then
evil becomes an awful unreality, and is real only to the false thought
which entertains or holds it.If life is real--and infinite mind must
itself be life--then death becomes the opposite unreality.And, as
Jesus said, it can be overcome.But were it real, _no power_, _divine
or human_, _could ever overcome or destroy it_!""Seems to me," remarked Haynerd dryly, "that our study so far simply
goes to show, as Burke puts it, 'what shadows we are and what shadows
we pursue.'""When the world humiliates itself to the point that it
will accept that, my friend," he said, "then it will become receptive
to truth."But now let us go a little further," he went on."The great Lamarck
voiced a mighty fact when he said, 'Function precedes structure.'For
by that we mean that the egg did not produce the bird, but the bird
the egg.The world seems about to pass from the very foolish belief
that physical structure is the cause of life, to the great fact that a
_sense_ of life produces the physical structure.The former crude
belief enslaved man to his body.The latter tends to free him from
such slavery.""You see, Doctor," interrupted Carmen, "the brain which you were
cutting up the other day did not make poor Yorick's mind and thought,
but his mind made the brain."The doctor smiled and shook a warning finger at the girl."The body," resumed Hitt, "is a manifestation of the human mind's
activity.What constitutes the difference between a bird and a steam
engine?This, in part: the engine is made by human hands from without;
the bird makes itself, that is, its body, from within.But the ignorant human mind--ignorant _per se_--falls
a slave to its own creation, the mental concept which it calls its
physical body, and which it pampers and pets and loves, until it can
cling to it no longer, because the mental concept, not being based on
any real principle, is forced to pass away, having nothing but false
thought to sustain it.""But now," interposed Haynerd, who was again waxing impatient, "just
what is the practical application of all this abstruse reasoning?""The very greatest imaginable, my friend," replied Hitt.And so matter can not become non-existent _unless it
is already nothing_!The world is beginning to recognize the
tremendous fact that from nothing nothing can be made.Very well,
since the law of the conservation of energy seems to be established as
regards energy _in toto_, why, we must conclude that there is no such
thing as _annihilation_.And that means that _there is no such thing
as absolute creation_!The shadow
never was real, and does not exist.And so creation becomes unfolding,
or revelation, or development, of what already exists, and has always
existed, and always will exist.Therefore, if matter, and all it
includes as concomitants, evil, sin, sickness, accident, chance, lack,
and death, is based upon unreal, false thought, then it can all be
removed, put out of consciousness, by a knowledge of truth and a
reversal of our accustomed human thought-processes.""And that," said Carmen, "is salvation.It is based on righteousness,
which is right-thinking, thinking true thoughts, and thinking truly.""And knowing," added Hitt, "that evil, including matter, is the
suppositional opposite of truth.The doctrine of materialism has been
utterly disproved even by the physicists themselves.For physicists
have at last agreed that inertia is the great essential property of
matter.That is, matter is not a cause, but an effect.It does not
operate, but is operated upon.It is not a law-giver, but is subject
to the human mind's so-called laws concerning it.It of itself is
utterly without life or intelligence."Now Spencer said that matter was a
manifestation of an underlying power or force.Physicists tell us that
matter is made of electricity, that it is an electrical phenomenon,
and that the ultimate constituent of matter is the electron.The
electron is said by some to be made up of superimposed layers of
positive and negative electricity, and by others to be made up of only
negative charges.I rather prefer the latter view, for if composed of
only negative electricity it is more truly a negation.Matter is the
_negative_ of real substance.Hence matter is a form of
energy also.But our comprehension of it is _wholly mental_.The only real energy there is or can be is the energy of the
infinite mind we call God.This the human mind copies, or imitates,
by reason of what has been called 'the law of suppositional
opposites,' already dwelt upon at some length.Gravitation is regarded by some physicists as the negative aspect of
radiation-pressure, the latter being the pressure supposed to be
exerted by all material bodies upon one another.The third law of
motion illustrates this so-called law, for it states that action
and reaction are equal and opposite.There can be no positive action
without a resultant negative one.The divine
mind, God, has His opposite in the communal human, or mortal, mind.The latter is manifested by the so-called minds which we call mankind.And from these so-called minds issue matter and material forms and
bodies, with their so-called material laws."Yes, the material universe is running down.The
entire human concept is running down.Matter, the human mental
concept, is not eternally permanent.Neither, therefore, are its
concomitants, sin and discord.Matter disintegrates and passes
away--out of human consciousness.The whole material universe--the
so-called mortal-mind concept--is hastening to its death!""But as yet I think you have not given Mr.Haynerd the practical
application which he asks," suggested Father Waite, as Hitt paused
after his long exposition."I am now ready for that," replied Hitt."We have said that the
material is the relative.But,
that being so, we can go a step further and add that human error is
likewise relative.And now--startling fact!--_it is absolutely
impossible to really know error_!""Can you know that two plus two
equals seven?""Let me make this statement of truth: nothing can be known definitely
except as it is explained by the principle which governs it.Now what
principle governs an error, whether that error be in music,
mathematics, or life conduct?"And that
is why God--infinite Mind--can not behold evil.And now, friends, I
have come to the conclusion of a long series of deductions.If
infinite mind is the cause and creator, that is, the revealer, of all
that really exists, its suppositional opposite, its negative, must
likewise simulate a creation, or revelation, or unfolding, for this
opposite must of very necessity pose as a creative principle.It must
simulate all the powers and attributes of the infinite creative mind.If the creative mind gave rise to a spiritual universe and spiritual
man, by which it expresses itself, then this suppositional opposite
must present its universe and its man, opposite in every particular to
the reality._It is this sort of man and this sort of universe that
we, as mortals, seem to see all about us, and that we refer to as
human beings and the physical universe._ And yet, all that we see,
feel, hear, smell, or taste is the false, suppositional thought that
comes into our so-called mentalities, and by its suppositional
activity there causes what we call consciousness or awareness of
things.""Then," said Father Waite, more to enunciate his own thought than to
question the deduction, "what the human consciousness holds as
knowledge is little more than belief and speculation, with no basis of
truth, no underlying principle."And it brings out the fruits of such beliefs in discord,
decay, and final dissolution, called death.For this human consciousness
forms its own concept of a fleshly body, and a mind-and-matter man.It
makes the laws which govern its body, and it causes its body to obey
these false laws.Upon the quality of thought entering this human
consciousness depend all the phenomena of earthly life and environment
which the mortal experiences.The human consciousness, in other words,
is a _self-centered mass of erroneous thought, utterly without any basis
of real principle, but actively engaged in building up mental images,
and forming and maintaining an environment in which it supposes
itself to live_._This false thought in the human consciousness forms
into a false concept of man, and this is the soul-and-body man, the
mind-and-matter man, which is called a human being, or a mortal._"

"And there," commented Carmen, with a dreamy, far-away look, "we have
what Padre Jose so long ago spoke of as the 'externalization of
thought.'It is the same law which Jesus had in mind when he said, 'As
a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.'""For we know only what enters our mentalities and
becomes active there.And every thought that does so enter, tends at
once to become externalized.That is, there is at once the tendency
for us to see it visualized in some way, either as material object, or
environment, or on our bodies.And it is the very activity of such
thought that constitutes the human mentality, as I have already
said.""And that thought is continually changing," suggested Father Waite.Its very lack of true principle requires that it should
change constantly, in order to simulate as closely as possible the
real.That accounts for the fleeting character of the whole human
concept of man and the physical universe.The human personality is
never fixed, although the elements of human character remain; that is,
those elements which are essentially unreal and mortal, such as lust,
greed, hatred, and materiality, seem to remain throughout the ages.They will give way only before truth, even as Paul said.But not until
truth has been admitted to the human mentality and begins its solvent
work there, the work of denying and tearing down the false
thought-concepts and replacing them with true ones.""And will truth come through the physical senses?"Their supposed testimony is the material thought which enters
the human mentality and becomes active there, resulting in human
consciousness of both good and evil.And that thought will have to
give way to true thought, before we can begin to put off the 'old man'
and put on the 'new.'Human thoughts, or, as we say, the physical
senses, do not and can not testify of absolute truth.exclaimed Haynerd, rousing up."There goes the Church, and
original sin, and fallen man!""There is no such thing as 'fallen man,' my friend," said Hitt
quietly."The spiritual man, the image and likeness, the reflection,
of the infinite creative mind, is perfect as long as its principle
remains perfect--and that is eternally.He is a product of false, suppositional thought.He did not fall, because he has had no perfection
to lose."Reverend Patterson Moore, who had sat a silent, though not wholly
sympathetic listener throughout the discussion, could now no longer
withhold his protest."No wonder," he abruptly exclaimed, "that there
are so few deep convictions to-day concerning the great essentials of
Christianity!As I sit here and listen to you belittle God and rend
the great truths of His Christ, as announced in His Word, the Bible, I
am moved by feelings poignantly sorrowful!The Christ has once been
crucified; and will you slay him again?""No," said Carmen, her eyes dilating with surprise, "but we would
resurrect him!Don't you think you have kept him in the tomb long
enough?The Christ-principle is intended for use, not for endless
burial!"My dear Miss Carmen, it is I who preach the risen Christ!""And
because of centuries of such preaching the world has steadily sunk
from the spiritual to the material, and lip service has taken the
place of that genuine spiritual worship which knows no evil, and
which, because of that practical knowledge, heals the sick and raises
the dead.""No, I state facts," said Carmen."Paul made some mistakes, for he was
consumed with zeal.But he stated truth when he said that the second
coming of Christ would occur when the 'old man' was put off.We have
been discussing the 'old man' to-night, and showing how he may be put
off.Now do you from your pulpit teach your people how that may be
done?""I teach the vicarious atonement of the Christ, and prepare my flock
for the world to come," replied the minister with some heat."But I am interested in the eternal present," said the girl, "not in a
suppositional future.'I am that which is, and which was, and which is to come,' says
the infinite, ever-present mind, God!""I see no Christianity whatsoever in your speculative philosophy,"
retorted the minister."If what you say is true, and the world should
accept it, all that we have learned in the ages past would be blotted
out, and falsehood would be written across philosophy, science, and
religion.By wafting evil lightly aside as unreal, you dodge the
issue, and extend license to all mankind to indulge it freely.Evil is
an awful, a stupendous fact!And it can not be relegated to the realm
of shadow, as you are trying to do!""You know, Duns Scotus
said: 'Since there is no real being outside of God, evil has no
substantial existence.Perfection and reality are synonyms, hence
absolute imperfection is synonymous with absolute unreality.'And do you really think he looked upon
evil as a _reality_?""Then, if that is true," said the girl, "I will have to reject him.But come, we are right up to the point of discussing him and his
teachings, and that will be the subject of our next meeting.It is love, you know, that has drawn us all
together."It's an open forum, Moore," said the doctor, patting him on the back."Wisdom isn't going to die with you."I am quite well satisfied with my present one, Doctor," replied the
minister tartly."Well, then, come and correct us when we err.It's your duty to save
us if we're in danger, you know.""And now, Carmen, the piano awaits you.By
the way, what did Maitre Rossanni tell you?""Oh," replied the girl lightly, "he begged me to let him train me for
Grand Opera.""He said I would make a huge fortune," she laughed."I told him I carried my wealth with me, always, and that my fortune
was now so immense that I couldn't possibly hope to add to it."Hitt," she said, going to him and looking up into his
face, "I am too busy for Grand Opera and money-making.I couldn't be happy if I made people pay to hear
me sing."With that she turned and seated herself at the piano, where she
launched into a song that made the very Reverend Patterson Moore raise
his glasses and stare at her long and curiously.CHAPTER 7


Man reasons and seeks human counsel; but woman obeys her instincts.Her life had been one of utter freedom from
dependence upon human judgment.The burden of decision as to the
wisdom of a course of action rested always upon her own thought.Never
did she seek to make a fellow-being her conscience.When the day of
judgment came, the hour of trial or vital demand, it found her
standing boldly, because her love was made perfect, not through
instinct alone, but through conformity with the certain knowledge that
he who lacks wisdom may find it in the right thought of God and man.And so, when on the next day she joined Hitt and Haynerd in the office
of the Social Era, and learned that Carlson had met their terms,
eagerly, and had transferred to them the moribund Express, she had no
qualms as to the wisdom of the step which they were taking.Haynerd was a composite picture of doubt
and fear, as he sat humped up in his chair.Hitt was serious to the
point of gloom, reflecting in a measure his companion's dismal
forebodings."I was scared to death for fear he wouldn't sell," Haynerd was saying
as the girl entered; "and I was paralyzed whenever I thought that he
would."Carmen laughed aloud when she heard these words."Do you know," she
said, "you remind me of Lot's wife.She was told to go ahead, along
the right course.But she looked back--alas for her!Now you two being
started right are looking back; and you are about to turn to salt
tears!"Now listen," she continued, as Haynerd began to remonstrate; "don't
voice a single fear to me!You couldn't make me believe them true even
if you argued for weeks--and we have no time for such foolishness
now.The first thing that you have got to do, Ned, is to start a
little cemetery.In it you must bury your fears, right away, and
without any mourning.Put up little headstones, if you wish; but don't
ever go near the place afterward, excepting to plant the insults, and
gibes, and denouncements, and vilifications which the human mind will
hurl at you, once the Express starts out on its new career.Good is
bound to stir up evil; and the Express is now in the business of good.Remember, the first thing the Apostles always did was to be afraid.And they kept Jesus busy pointing out the nothingness of their
fears.""I guess we'll find
ourselves a bit lonely in it, too!""True, humanly speaking," replied the girl, taking a chair beside him."But, Ned, let me tell you of the most startling thing I have found in
this great, new country.It is this: you Americans have, oh, so much
animal courage--and so little true moral courage!You know that the
press is one of the most corrupt institutions in America, don't you?Going into thousands of homes every day, it is
a deadlier menace than yellow fever.You know that it is muzzled by
so-called religious bodies, by liquor interests, by vice-politicians,
by commercialism, and its own craven cowardice.And yet, Ned, despite
your heart-longing, you dare not face the world and stand boldly for
righteousness in the conduct of the Express!"Now," she went on hurriedly, "let me tell you more.While you have
been debating with your fears as you awaited Mr.Carlson's decision, I
have been busy.If I had allowed my mentality to become filled with
fear and worry, as you have done, I would have had no room for real,
constructive thought.But I first thanked God for this grand
opportunity to witness to Him; and then I put out every mental
suggestion of failure, of malicious enmity from the world, and from
those who think they do not love us, and with it every subtle argument
about the unpreparedness of the human mind for good.After that I set
out to visit various newspaper offices in the city.I have talked with
four managing and city editors since yesterday noon.I have their
viewpoints now, and know what motives animate them.I know, in part, what the Express will have to meet--and how to
meet it."Both men stared at her in blank amazement.Haynerd's jaw dropped as he
gazed.He had had a long apprenticeship in the newspaper field, but
never would he have dared attempt what this fearless girl had just
done."I have found out what news is," Carmen resumed."It is wholly _a
human invention_!It is the published vagaries of the carnal mind.In
the yellow journal it is the red-inked, screaming report of the
tragedies of sin.Fallom if he knew anything about mental
laws, and the terrible results of mental suggestion in his paper's
almost hourly heralding of murder, theft, and lust.But he only
laughed and said that the lurid reports of crime tended to keep people
alive to what was going on about them.He couldn't see that he was
making a terrible reality of every sort of evil, and holding it so
constantly before an ignorant, credulous world's eyes that little else
could be seen.The moral significance of his so-called news reports
had no meaning whatsoever for him!"asked Haynerd, not believing that she would
have dared visit that journalistic demon."Yes," answered the girl, to his utter astonishment.Adams said
he had no time for maudlin sentimentalism or petticoat sophistry.He
was in the business of collecting and disseminating news, and he
wanted that news to go _shrieking_ out of his office!You can see how the report of an Italian
wife-murder shrieks in red letters an inch high on the very first
page.Or has
he further prostituted journalism by this ignorant act?""The people want it, Carmen," said Hitt slowly, though his voice
seemed not to sound a real conviction."If the church and the
press were not mortally and morally blind, they would see the deadly
destruction which they are accomplishing by shrieking from pulpit and
sanctum: 'Evil is real!Pietro Lasanni cuts his wife's throat!"But, Carmen, while what you say is doubtless true, it must be
admitted that the average man, especially the day laborer, reads his
yellow journal avidly, and--"

"Yes, he does," returned the girl.The average man, as
you call him, is a victim of _the most pernicious social system
ever devised by the human mind_!Swept along in the mad rush of
commercialism, or ground down beneath its ruthless wheels, his
jaded, jarred nerves and his tired mind cry out for artificial
stimulation, for something that will for a moment divert his wearied
thought from his hopeless situation.The Church offers him little
that is tangible this side of the grave.But whiskey, drugs, and
yellow journalism do.Hitt--can't you, Ned--that
the world's cry for sensationalism is but a cry for something that
will make it forget its misery for a brief moment?The average man
feels the superficiality of the high speed of this century of mad
rush; he longs as never before for a foundation of truth upon which to
rest; he is tired of theological fairy-tales; he is desperately
tired of sin, and sickness, and dying.He cares little about a
promised life beyond the grave.He wants help here and now to solve
his problems.Little beyond a recount
of his own daily miseries, and reports of graft and greed, and
accounts of vulgar displays of material wealth that he has not and
can not have.And these reports divert his jaded mind for a moment and
give him a false, fleeting sense of pleasure--and then leave him
sunk deeper than before in despair, and in hatred of existing
conditions!""The girl is right," said Hitt, turning to Haynerd."And we knew it,
of course.This steam-calliope
age reflects the human-mind struggle for something other than its own
unsatisfying ideas.It turns to thrills; it expresses its restlessness
and dissatisfaction with itself by futurist and cubist art, so-called;
by the rattle and vibration of machinery; by flaring billboards that
insult every sense of the artistic; and by the murk and muck of yellow
journalism, with its hideous  supplements and spine-thrilling
tales.But the publisher himself--well, he
battens materially, of course, upon the tired victims of our degrading
social system.He sees but the sordid revenue in dollars and cents."And they can't," said Haynerd."Decent journalism wouldn't
pay--doesn't--never did!Other papers have tried it, and miserably
failed!""Then," returned Hitt calmly, after a moment's reflection, "oil will
meet the deficit.As long as my paternal wells flow in Ohio the
Express will issue forth as a clean paper, a dignified, law-supporting
purveyor to a taste for better things--even if it has to create that
taste.Its columns will be closed to salacious sensation, and its
advertising pages will be barred to vice, liquor, tobacco, and
drugs.""And now we've got to get right down to
business.""Just so," said Hitt, rising."It is my intention to issue the Express
one more week on its present basis, and then turn it into a penny
morning daily.I'm going to assume the management myself, with you, Carmen, as
my first assistant."But, first, how far may
I go?""The limit," replied Hitt, rubbing his hands together."You are my
brain, so to speak, henceforth.As to financial resources, I am
prepared to dump a hundred thousand dollars right into the Express
before a cent of revenue comes back.""Another question, then: will you issue a Sunday edition?""For a while, yes," he said."We'll see how it works, for I have some
ideas to try out.""Well, then," resumed the girl eagerly, "I want this paper to be for
_all_ the people; to be independent in the truest sense of the term;
and to be absolutely beyond the influence of political and religious
sectarianism--you'll soon enough learn what that will cost you--to be
an active, constructive force in this great city, and a patient,
tireless, loving educator."grunted Haynerd, although he was listening very carefully."The Express will succeed," the girl went on, without noticing him,
"because our thought regarding it is successful._We_ have already
succeeded; and that success will be externalized in our work.It makes
no difference what the people may think of _us_; but it makes a lot of
difference what _we_ think of _them_ and _ourselves_.We assume superiority over adverse conditions, and we
claim success, because we know that these things are mental, and that
they are divinely ours.Lot's wife didn't have the sort of confidence
that wins--she looked back.But
there is no doubt of the outcome.And so there is no doubt lurking in
us to take the edge off our efforts, is there?The thought regarding
the Express has not been timidly born within us; it has come forth
flashing vigor!Yes it has, Ned, despite your doubts!And we have
within us a power mightier than any force outside of us.That is the
knowledge of infinite mind's omnipotence, and our ability to use the
Christ-principle to meet _every_ problem.Haynerd began to rouse up with a returning sense of confidence.Hitt
smiled and nodded to Carmen.The girl went on rapidly and eagerly:

"We are going to give the people news from a new standpoint, aren't
we?We are not going on the assumption that the report of mankind's
errors is the report of real news.The only thing that is really new
is _good_.Adams's office two
items came in over the 'phone.One was the report of a jewel robbery,
and the other was an announcement of the draining by the Government of
submerged lands in Louisiana, so as to give an additional opportunity
to those seeking farms.Adams put in bold type on
the front page?I was unable to locate the latter
anywhere in the paper, although it was a timely bit of news.""Now another thing," continued the girl, "I want the Sunday edition of
the Express to contain a resume of the important and vital news of the
week, with the very clearest, most impartial and enlightening
editorial comment upon it.This calls for nice discrimination in the
selection of those items for our comment.It means, however, the best
practical education for the people.This was John Ruskin's idea, and
certainly is a splendid one.Still another thing, the Express will
stand shoulder to shoulder with the women for equal suffrage."It is the women who will clean up
and regenerate this world, not the men.Reform is now in the hands of
the women.And India proves that
backward women mean a backward nation.""Then," continued Carmen, "make a distinct Women's Department in the
Express, and put Miss Wall on the staff.""A daily educational department for foreigners, our immigrants, giving
them every possible aid in suggestions regarding their naturalization,
the languages, hotels, boarding houses, employment, and so on.""The Express is going to maintain a social service, and night schools.It is going to establish vacation and permanent homes for girls.It is
going to provide for vocational training.It is going to establish a
lecture bureau--for lectures on _good_.It is going to build a model
city for workingmen.Then it is going to found a model city for
everybody.It is going to establish clubs and meeting places for
workingmen, places where they may meet, and play games, and read, and
have social intercourse, and practical instruction.It is going to
establish the same for young boys.It is going to take the lead for
civic betterment in this city, and for child-welfare, and for--"

By this time Haynerd was sitting erect and staring in bewilderment at
the girl."Aren't you wandering
somewhat beyond strict newspaper limits?"And haven't I told you," returned the girl promptly, "that the only
thing new in this world is _good_?Our news is going to be _good_
news--the collection and dissemination of _good_ to all mankind.People who read our paper will no longer feel that it is dangerous to
be alive, but a glorious privilege.Hitt said I could go the limit, you know."Hitt had caught the girl's infectious enthusiasm, and his face was
beaming."It's your unlimited thought, Carmen, that
we old dry-bones want!What is anything in this life, compared with real
service to our fellow-men?_The Express is not in business to make
money!_ It is in the business of collecting and scattering the news of
good.Its dividends will be the happiness and joy it gives to mankind.For _good is the greatest success there
is_!"It is likely that Hitt did not catch the full meaning of the girl's
words; and it is certain that Haynerd did not.But her boundless
enthusiasm did penetrate in large degree into their souls, and they
ceased to insist on the query, Will it pay?The broader outlook was
already beginning to return profits to these men, as the newer
definition of 'news' occupied their thought.Seizing their hats, they bade Carmen go with them to inspect the plant
of the Express, and meet its staff."There's a question I'd like to ask," said Haynerd, as they pursued
their way toward their recent purchase."I want to know what our
editorial policy will be.Do we condone the offenses of our grafters
and spoilsmen by remaining silent regarding their crimes?"We will let their guilt expose and kill itself," quickly returned
Carmen.A few minutes later they entered the gloomy, dust-laden offices of the
Express.Hitt's spirits sank again as he looked about him.But Carmen
seemed to suffer no loss of enthusiasm.After a mental appraisal of
the dingy, uninviting environment she exclaimed: "Well, one nice thing
about this is that we don't have much to start with!"Hitt reflected upon her cryptical remark, and then laughed.It was evident that the sale of
his plant had removed a heavy load from his shoulders."My best reporter was out yesterday when you called," he said,
addressing Hitt."He--well, he was a little the worse for wear.Come into my office and I'll send for him."In a few minutes a tall, boyish fellow responded to the editor's
summons.He must have been well under twenty, thought Hitt, marveling
that so young a man should be regarded as Carlson's best news
gatherer.But his wonder grew apace when the editor introduced him as
Mr.The lad smiled pallidly, as he bent his gaze upon Carmen, and
addressed his reply to her."My governor," he said laconically.returned Haynerd, beginning to bristle.Carlson dismissed the reporter, and turned to the curious group."The boy has the making of a fine newspaper man in him.Has something
of his father's terrible energy.He used to come down here before his father threw him out.I
let him write little articles for the Express when he was barely
sixteen years old; and they were mighty good, too.But he got mixed up
in some scandal, and J. Wilton cut him off.The boy always did drink,
I guess.But since his family troubles he's been on the straight road
to the insane asylum."His father is no
friend of mine, and--"

"We _shall_ keep him," calmly interrupted Carmen."His father is a
_very_ good friend of mine."Carlson looked from one to the other quizzically."Well," squinting over his glasses at the girl, "this surely is
woman's era, isn't it?"*       *       *       *       *

A week later the Express, scarcely recognizable in its clean, fresh
type and modest headlines, with its crisp news and well written
editorials, very unostentatiously made its entry into the already
crowded metropolitan field.Adams picked it up and
laughed, a short, contemptuous laugh.Fallom glanced over it and
wondered.J. Wilton Ames, who had been apprised of its advent, threw
it into the waste basket--and then drew it out again.He re-read the
editorial announcing the policy of the paper.From that he began a
careful survey of the whole sheet.His eye caught an article on the
feminist movement, signed by Carmen Ariza.His lip curled, but he read
the article through, and finished with the mental comment that it was
well written."I want this sheet carefully watched," he commanded, tossing the paper
to his secretary."If anything is noticed that in any way refers to me
or my interests, call my attention to it immediately."A moment afterward Henry Claus,
nominal head of the great Claus brewing interests, was ushered in.cried the newcomer, rushing
forward and clasping the financier's hand."The city council last
night voted against the neighborhood saloon license bill!"Yes," commented the laconic Ames."Our aldermen are a very
intelligent lot of statesmen, Claus.They're wise enough to see that
their jobs depend upon whiskey.It requires very astute statesmanship,
Claus, to see that.But some of our congressmen and senators have
learned the same thing."The brewer pondered this delphic utterance and scratched his head."Well," continued Ames, "have you your report?""Sales
less than last month," he remarked dryly."It's the local option law what done it, Mr.Ames," replied the brewer
apologetically."Them women--"

"Bah!Let a few petticoats whip you, eh?But, anyway, you don't know
how to market your stuff.Look here, Claus, you've got to encourage
the young people more.We've got to get the girls and boys.If we get
the girls, we'll get the boys easily enough.It's the same in the
liquor business as in certain others, Claus, you've got to land them
young."Ames, I can't take 'em and pour it down their throats!""You could if you knew how," returned Ames.if I had
nothing else to do I'd just like to devote myself to the sales end of
the brewing business.I'd use mental suggestion in such a way through
advertising that this country would drown in beer!Beer is just plain
beer to you dull-wits.But suppose we convinced people that it was a
food, eh?Advertise a chemical analysis of it, showing that it has
greater nutriment than beef.Catch the clerks and poor stenographers
that way.Don't call it beer; call it Maltdiet, or something like
that.Why, we couldn't begin to supply the demand!""Billboards in every field and along all railroads and highways;
boards in every vacant lot in every town and city in the country;
electric signs everywhere; handbills; lectures--never thought of that,
did you?And samples--why, I'd put samples into every house in the
Union!I'd give away a million barrels of beer--and sell a hundred
million as a result!But I'd work particularly with the young people.Work on them with literature and suggestion; they're more receptive
than adults.The hypnotism that works through suggestive advertising,
Claus, is simply omnipotent!"We have all the papers, excepting the Express, Mr.You can
afford to pass it up.It's run by a college professor and a doll-faced
girl."Ames, our advertising manager tells me that the publishers
of the Express called a meeting of the managers of all the other city
papers, to discuss cutting out liquor advertising, and that since then
the rates have gone up, way up!You see, the example set by the
Express may--"

"Humph!"An example, backed by
absolute fearlessness--and he knew from experience that the publishers
of the Express were without fear--well, it could not be wholly
ignored, even if the new paper had no circulation worth the name.Ames," resumed the brewer, "the Express is in every newsstand in
the city.It's in every hotel, in every
saloon, in every store and business house here.It
isn't sold, it's given away!"Leave it to me, Claus," he said at length, dismissing the brewer."I'll send for you in a day or so."*       *       *       *       *

It was well after midnight when the little group assembled in the
dining room of the Beaubien cottage to resume their interrupted
discussions.Hitt and Haynerd were the last to arrive.With him had come, not without
some reluctance, his prickly disputant, Reverend Patterson Moore, and
another friend and colleague, Doctor Siler, whose interest in these
unique gatherings had been aroused by Morton."I've tried to give him a resume of our previous deductions," the
latter explained, as Hitt prepared to open the discussion."And he
says he has conscientious scruples--if you know what that means.""He's a Philistine, that's all, eh?""I am like my friend, Reverend Edward
Hull, who says--"

"There!""Your friend has a life job molding the
plastic minds of prospective preachers, and he doesn't want to lose
the sinecure.Got a wife and babies depending on
him.He still preaches hell-fire and the resurrection of the flesh,
doesn't he?Well, in that case we can dispense with his views, for
we've sent that sort of doctrine to the ash heap."Reverend Moore opened his mouth as if to protest; but Hitt prevented
him by taking the floor and plunging at once into his subject."The
hour is very late," he said in apology, "and we have much ground to
cover.Carmen stole a hand beneath the table and grasped the Beaubien's."As I sat in my office this morning," began Hitt meditatively, "I
looked often and long through the window and out over this great,
roaring city.Everywhere I saw tremendous activity, frantic hurry, and
nerve-racking strife.In the distance I marked the smoke curling
upward from huge factories, packing houses, and elevators.The
incessant seething, the rush and bustle, the noise, the heat, and
dust, all spelled business, an enormous volume of human business--and
yet, _not one iota of it contributed even a mite to the spiritual
nature and needs of mankind_!And then I looked down, far down, into the
streets below.And I saw,
too, men and women, rich and comfortable, riding along happily in
their automobiles, with not a thought beyond their physical
well-being.But, I asked myself, should they not ride thus, if they
wish?And yet, the hour will soon come when sickness, disaster, and
death will knock at their doors and sternly bid them come out."Just what I have sought to impress upon you whenever you advanced
your philosophical theories, Doctor," said Reverend Moore, turning to
Morton.The doctor glowered back at him without reply."Now what should the man in the automobile do?Is there anything he
_can_ do, after all?Jesus told such as he to seek
first the kingdom of harmony--a demonstrable understanding of truth.The automobile riding would follow after that, and with safety.Why,
oh, why, will we go on wasting our precious time acquiring additional
physical sensations in motor cars, amusement parks, travel, anywhere
and everywhere, instead of laboring first to acquire that real
knowledge which alone will set us free from the bitter woes of human
existence!""Jesus set us free, sir," interposed Reverend Moore sternly."And his
vicarious atonement opens the door of immortality to all who believe
on his name."Moore, you believe will be acquired only after
death.At present we see mankind laboring for that which even they
themselves admit is not meat.They waste their substance for what is
not bread.Because of their false beliefs of God and man,
externalized in a viciously cruel social system; because of their
dependence upon the false supports of _materia medica_, orthodox
theology, man-devised creeds, and human opinions."And yet, who hath believed our report?men in our
day think and read little that is serious; and they reflect hardly at
all upon the vital things of life.They want to be let alone in their
comfortable materialistic beliefs, even though those beliefs rend
them, rive them, rack and twist them with vile, loathsome disease, and
then sink them into hideous, worm-infested graves!The human mind does
not want its undemonstrable beliefs challenged.It does not want the
light of unbiased investigation thrown upon the views which it has
accepted ready-made from doctor and theologian.Because,
my friends, the human mind is inert, despite its seemingly tremendous
material activity.And its inertia is the result of its own
self-mesmerism, its own servile submission to beliefs which, as
Balfour has shown, have grown up under every kind of influence except
that of genuine evidence.Chief of these are the prevalent religious
beliefs, which we are asked to receive as divinely inspired."But that
gentleman sat stolid, with arms folded and a scowl upon his sharp
features."Religion," continued Hitt, "is that which binds us to the real.what a farce mankind have made of it.Because, in its mad
desire to make matter real and to extract all pleasures from it, the
human mind has tried to eliminate the soul.""We have been having a bad spell of materialism, that's true,"
interposed Doctor Morton."Well," Hitt replied, "perhaps so.Yet almost in our own day France
put God out of her institutions; set up and crowned a prostitute as
the goddess of reason; and trailed the Bible through the streets of
Paris, tied to the tail of an ass!And in this country we have enthroned so-called physical
science, and, as Comte predicted, are about to conduct God to the
frontier and bow Him out with thanks for His provisional services.As our droll philosopher, Hubbard, has said, 'Once
man was a spirit, now he is matter.Once he was a flame, now he is a
candlestick.Once he was a son of God, now he is a chemical formula.Once he was an angel, now he is plain mud.'""But," exclaimed Reverend Moore, visibly nettled, "that is because of
his falling away from the Church--"

"My friend," said Hitt calmly, "he fell away from the Church because
he could not stagnate longer with her and be happy.Orthodox theology
has largely become mere sentimentalism.The average man has a horror
of being considered a namby-pamby, religiously weak, wishy-washy,
so-called Christian.It makes him ashamed of himself to stand up
in a congregation and sing 'My Jesus, I love Thee,' and 'In
mansions of glory and endless delight.'And he is far more concerned about his little brick bungalow
and next month's rent than he is about celestial mansions.No; he leaves religion to women, whom he regards as the
weaker sex.He turns to the ephemeral wisdom of human science--and,
poor fool!Well, how
often nowadays do you hear the name of God on their lips?Is He ever the topic of conversation at
receptions and balls?No; that person was right who said that
religion 'does not rise to the height of successful gossip.'It
stands no show with the latest cabaret dance, the slashed skirt,
and the daringly salacious drama as a theme of discourse.Oh, yes,
we still maintain our innumerable churches.And, though religion is
the most vital thing in the world to us, we hire a preacher to talk
to us once a week about it!Would we hire men to talk once a week to
us about business?But religion is far, far less important to
human thought than business--for the latter means automobiles and
increased opportunities for physical sensation."Hitt," objected Doctor Siler, "I am sure this is not such a
godless era as you would make out.""We have many gods, chief of whom is matter.The
world's acknowledged god is not spirit, despite the inescapable fact
that the motive-power of the universe is spiritual, and the only
action is the expression of thought."But now," he continued, "we have in our previous discussions made
some startling deductions, and we came to the conclusion that there is
a First Cause, and that it is infinite mind.But, having agreed upon
that, are we now ready to admit the logical corollary, namely, that
there can be but _one_ real mind?For that follows from the premise
that there is but one God who is infinite.""We have but the one mind, God," he replied.Human men reflect the communal mortal
mind, which is the suppositional opposite of the divine mind that is
God.I repeat, the so-called human mind knows not God.It sees only its own interpretations of Him
and His manifestations."Well, they might be," suggested Doctor Siler."Well then," he said, "if you will not admit that all
things are mental--including the entire universe--you certainly are
forced to admit that your comprehension of things is mental.""Then you will likewise have to admit that you are not concerned with
_things_, but with your comprehension of things.""And so, after all, you deal only with mental things--and everything
is mental to you.""The Bible states clearly that He created _all_ things," returned that
gentleman a little stiffly."My friends," resumed Hitt very earnestly, "we are on the eve of a
tremendous enlightenment, I believe.And for that we owe much to the
so-called 'theory of suppositional opposites.'We have settled to our
satisfaction that, although mankind believe themselves to be dependent
upon air, food, and water for existence, nevertheless they are really
dependent upon something vastly finer, which is back of those things.That'something' we call God, for it is good.Matthew Arnold said that
the only thing that can be verified about God is that He is 'the
eternal power that makes for righteousness.'Very well, we are almost
willing to accept that alone--for that carries infinite implications.It makes God an eternal, spiritual power, omnipotent as an influence
for good.It makes Him the infinite patron, so to speak, of
right-thinking.So it makes Him
the sole creative force."But," he continued, "force, or power, is not material.God by very
necessity is mind, including all intelligence.And His operations are
conducted according to the spiritual law of evolution.Oh, yes,
evolution is not a theory, it is a fact.God, infinite mind, evolves,
uncovers, reveals, unfolds, His numberless eternal ideas.The greatest of these is the one that
includes all others and expresses and reflects Him perfectly.That is the man who was'made'--revealed, manifested--in
His image and likeness.There is no other image and likeness of God.Moreover, God has always existed, and always will.So His ideas,
including real man, have had no beginning.They were not created, as
we regard creation, but have been unfolded.But now we come to the peculiar part,
namely, the fact that _reality seems always to have its shadow in
unreality_.The magnet has
its opposite poles, one positive, the other negative.At the lowest ebb of the
world's morals appeared the Christ.The Christian religion springs
from the soil of a Roman Emperor's blood-soaked gardens.Errors hampering the solving of
mathematical problems.That
which stands the test of demonstration as to permanence, I say with
Spencer."And now we learn that it is the _communal mortal mind_ that stands as
the opposite and negative of the infinite mind that is God, and that
it is but a supposition, without basis of real principle or fact.It
has its law of evolution, too, and evolves its types in human beings
and animals, in mountain, tree, and stream.All material nature, in
fact, is but the manifestation, or reflection, of this communal mortal
mind."But, though God had no beginning, and will have no ending, this
communal mortal mind, on the contrary, did have a seeming beginning,
and will end its pseudo-existence.It seemingly
evolved its universe, and its earth as its lower stratum.It made its
firmament, and it gradually filled its seas with moving things that
manifested its idea of life.Slowly, throughout inconceivable eons of
time, it unrolled and evolved, until at last, through untold
generations of stupid, sluggish, often revolting animal forms, it
began to evolve a type of mind, a crude representation of the mind
that is God, and manifesting its own concept of intelligence."Now what was this communal mortal mind doing?Counterfeiting divine
mind, if I may so express it.But
types that were without basis of principle, and so they passed
away--the higher forms died, the lower disintegrated.Aye, death came
into the world because of sin, for the definition of sin is the
Aramaic word which Jesus used, translated '_hamartio_,' which means
'missing the mark.'Yes, sin came through Adam, for
Adam is the name of the communal mortal mind."Well, ages and ages passed, reckoned in the human mind concept of
time.The evolution was continually toward a higher and ever higher
type.Paleolithic man still died, because he did not have enough real
knowledge in his mortal mind to keep him from missing the mark.He
probably had no belief in a future life, for he did not bury his dead
after the manner of those who later manifested this belief.But, after
the lapse of centuries, Neolithic man was found manifesting such a
belief.This: the mortal mind was translating the
divine idea of immortality into its own terms and thus expressing it.The curtain began to rise upon what we call human
history.The idea of a power not itself began to filter through the
mist of mortal mind, and human beings felt its influence, the
influence that makes for righteousness.And then, at last, through the
mortal mind there began to filter the idea of the one God.The people
who best reflected this idea were the ancient Israelites.They called
themselves the 'chosen' people.Their so-called minds were, as Carmen
has expressed it, like window-panes that were a little cleaner than
the others.They let a bit more of the light through.God is light,
you know, according to the Scriptures.And little by little they began
to record their thoughts regarding their concept of the one God.And soon they were seeing their God
manifested everywhere, and hearing His voice in every sound of Nature.And thus began that strange and mighty
book, the Bible, _the record of the evolution of the concept of God in
the human mind_.""Do you mean to say that the Bible was not given by inspiration?""This filtering process that I have been speaking
about _is_ inspiration.Every bit of truth that comes to you or me
to-day comes by inspiration--the breathing in--of the infinite mind
that is truth."And so," he went on, "we have those reflections of the communal
mortal mind which we call the Israelites recording their thoughts and
ideas.Sometimes they recorded plain fact; sometimes they wrapped
their moral teachings in allegories and fables.Josephus says of Moses
that he wrote some things enigmatically, some allegorically, and the
rest in plain words, since in his account of the first chapter of
Genesis and the first three verses of the second he gives no hint of
any mystery at all.But when he comes to the fourth verse of the
second chapter he says Moses, after the seventh day was over, began
to talk philosophically, and so he understood the rest of the second
and third chapters in some enigmatical and allegorical sense.Quite
so, it appears to me, for the writer, whoever he was, was then
attempting the impossible task of explaining the enigma of evil, the
origin of which is associated always with the dust-man.""You deny the truth of the account of the creation as given in the
second chapter of Genesis, do you?""You deny
that man was tempted and fell?""Well," said Hitt, smiling, "of course there is no special reason for
denying that serpents may have talked, millions and millions of years
ago.In fact, they still have rudimentary organs of speech--as do most
animals.Snakes developed in the
Silurian Era, some twenty million years ago.In the vast intervening
stretch of time they may have lost their power to talk.But, as for
the second chapter of Genesis, Moses may or may not have written it.Indeed, he may not have written the first.The book of
Genesis shows plainly that it is a composite of several books by
various authors.I incline to the belief that some more materialistic
hand and mind than Moses's composed that second chapter.However that
may be, it is a splendid example of the human mind's crude attempt to
interpret the spiritual creation in its own material terms.It in a
way represents the dawning upon the human mind of the idea of the
spiritual creation.For when finite sense approaches the infinite it
must inevitably run into difficulties with which it can not cope; it
must meet problems which it can not solve, owing to its lack of a
knowledge of the infinite principle involved.That's why the world
rejected the first account of the creation and accepted the second,
snake-story, dust-man, apple tree, and all."exclaimed Haynerd, his eyes wide agape."You're like a
story-book!"We know that man appeared on this
earth in comparatively recent times.For millions and millions of
years before he was evolved animals and vegetables had been dying."Your difficulty arises from the fact that
we are accustomed to associate sin with human personality.But
remember, the physical universe has been evolved from the communal
mortal mind.It has been dying from
the very beginning of its seeming existence, for its seeming existence
alone is sin.The vegetables, the animals, and now the men, that have
been evolved from it, and that express it and reflect and manifest
it, must die, necessarily, because the so-called mind from which they
evolve is not based upon the eternal, immortal principle, God.And so
it and they miss the mark, and always have done so.You must cease to
say, Whose sin?Remember that the sin is inherent in the so-called
mind that is expressed by things material.The absence of the
principle which is God is sin, according to the Aramaic word,
translated '_hamartio_,' which Jesus used.The most lowly cell that
swam in the primeval seas manifested the communal mortal mind's sin,
and died as a consequence.""In other words, it manifested a supposition, as opposed to truth?""Its existence was quite suppositional," replied Hitt."It did not
manifest life, but a material sense of existence.And so the communal mortal mind,
so-called, determined these first lowly material and objective forms
of existence.They were its phenomena, and they manifested it.Different types now manifest it, after long ages.But all are equally
without basis of principle, all are subject to the mortal law that
everything material contains within itself the elements for its own
destruction, and all must pass away.In our day we are dealing with
the highest type of mortal mind so far evolved, the human man.He,
too, knows but one life, human life, the mortal-mind sense of
existence.His human life is demonstrably only a series of states of
material consciousness, states of thought-activity.The classification
and placing of these states of consciousness give him his sense of
time.The positing of his mental concepts give him his sense of space.His consciousness is a thought-activity, externalizing human opinions,
ideas, and beliefs, not based on truth.This consciousness--or
supposititious human mind--is very finite in nature, and so is
essentially self-centered.It attributes its fleshly existence to
material things.It believes that its life depends upon its fleshly
body; and so it thinks itself in constant peril of losing it.It goes
further, and believes that there are multitudes of other human minds,
each having its own human, fleshly existence, or life, and each
capable of doing it and one another mortal injury.It believes that it
can be deprived by its neighboring mortal minds of all that it needs
for its sustenance, and that it can improve its own status at their
expense, and vice versa.It is filled with fears--not knowing that God
is infinite good--and its fears become externalized as disaster, loss,
calamity, disease, and death at last.It has no basis of principle to rest upon, and so it
constantly shifts and changes to accord with its own shifting thought.It is here to-day, and gone
to-morrow.""Well, Ned," said Hitt, "there is this hope: human consciousness
always refers its states to something.It is infinite mind, God, and its infinite manifestation.The human
mind still translates or interprets God's greatest idea, Man, as 'a
suffering, sinning, troubled creature,' forgetting that this creature
is only a mental concept, and that the human mind is looking only at
its own thoughts, and that these thoughts are counterfeits of God's
real thoughts."Moreover, though the human mind is finite, and can not even begin to
grasp the infinite, the divine mind has penetrated the mist of error.There is a spark of real reflection in every mortal.That spark can be
made to grow into a flame that will consume all error and leave the
real man revealed, a consciousness that knows no evil.There is now
enough of a spark of intelligence in the human, so-called mind to
enable it to lay hold on truth and grow out of itself.And there is no
excuse for not doing so, as Jesus said.If he had not come we wouldn't
have known that we were missing the mark so terribly.""Well," observed Haynerd, "after that classification I don't see that
we mortals have much to be puffed up about!""All human beings, or mortals, Ned," said Hitt, "are interpretations
by the mortal mind of infinite mind's idea of itself, Man.These
interpretations are made in the human mind, and they remain posited
there.All are false,
and doomed to decay.How, then, can one mortal look down with
superciliousness upon another, when all are in the same identical
class?"Carmen's thoughts rested for a moment upon the meaningless existence
of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had anchored her life in the shifting
sands of the flesh and its ephemeral joys."Now," resumed Hitt, "we will come back to the question of progress.What is progress but the growing of the human mind out of itself under
the influence of the divine stimulus of demonstrable truth?And that
is made possible when we grasp the stupendous fact that the human,
mortal mind, including its man, is absolutely unreal and non-existent!The human man changes rapidly in mind, and, consequently, in its lower
stratum, or expression, the body.For that reason he need not carry
over into to-day the old, false beliefs which were manifested by him
yesterday.If he leaves them in the past, they cease to be manifested
in his present or future.Then, opening
himself to truth, he lays off the 'old man' and puts on the 'new.'He
denies himself--denies that there is any truth in the seeming reality
of the mortal, material self--as Jesus bade us do."His ideas and the thoughts regarding them must always have existed.He, as mind, is an inexhaustible
reservoir of thought.Now the human, mortal mind interprets His
thoughts, and so _seems_ to manufacture new thought.It makes new
interpretations, but not new thoughts.When you hear people chatting,
do you think they are manufacturing new thought?They
are but reflecting, or voicing, the communal so-called mortal mind's
interpretations of God's innumerable and real thoughts.""And so," suggested Father Waite, "the more nearly correct our
interpretations of His thoughts are, the nearer we approach to
righteousness.""There exist all sorts of real thoughts
about God's ideas.But the human mind
makes likewise all sorts of erroneous translations of them.We shall
solve our problem of existence when we correctly interpret His
thoughts, and use them only.When the human mentality becomes attuned
or accustomed to certain thoughts, that kind flow into it readily from
the communal mortal mind.Some people think for years along certain
erroneous or criminal lines.Their minds are set in that direction,
and invite such a flow of thought.But were they to reverse the'set,'
there would be a very different and better resulting externalization
in health, prosperity, and morals.""I think I see," said Miss Wall."And I begin to glimpse the true
mission of Jesus, and why he was ready to give up everything for it."And now a word further about the so-called mortal mind.For,
when we have collected and arranged all our data regarding it, we will
find ourselves in a position to begin to work out of it, and thereby
truly work out our salvation, even if with fear and trembling.I have
said in a previous talk that, judging by the deductions of the
physical scientists, everything seems about to leave the material
basis and turn into vibrations, and'man changes with velocity' of
these.They tell us that all life depends upon water; that life began,
eons ago, in the primeval sea.True, the human sense of existence, as
I have said, began in the dark, primeval sea of mist, the deep and
fluid mortal mind, so-called.And that sense of existence most
certainly is dependent upon the fluid of mortal mind.Bichat has said
that 'life is the sum of the forces that resist death.'Spencer has
defined life as the 'continuous adjustment of internal to external
relations.'Very good, as applied to the human sense of life.The
human mind makes multitudes of mental concepts, and then struggles
incessantly to adjust itself to them, and at length gives up the
struggle, hopelessly beaten.Scientists tell us that life is due to a
continuous series of bodily ferments.The body is in a constant state
of ferment, and that gives rise to life.We know that the human
mind is in a state of incessant ferment.The human mind is a
self-centered mass of writhing, seething, fermenting material thought.And that fermentation is outwardly manifested in its concept of body,
and its material environment.The scientists themselves are rapidly
pushing matter back into the realm of the human mind.Bodily states
are becoming recognized as manifestations of mental states--not vice
versa, as has been ignorantly believed for ages.A prominent physician
told me the other day that many a condition of nervous prostration now
could be directly traced to selfishness.We know that hatred and anger
produce fatal poisons.The rattlesnake is a splendid example of that.I am told that its poison and the white of an egg are formed of
_exactly the same amounts of the same elements_.The difference in
effect is the thought lying back of each.""You don't pretend that the snake
thinks and hates--"

"Doctor," said Hitt, "for thousands upon thousands of years the human
race has been directing hatred and fear-thoughts toward the snake.Is
it any wonder that the snake is now poisonous?That it now reflects
back that poisonous thought to mankind?""But some are not poisonous, you know.""Can we say how long they have not been so, or how soon our hatred
will make them all poisonous?Do you know, moreover, that sorrow,
remorse, all emotions, in fact, affect the perspiration that exudes
from the human body?Do you know that hatred will render human
perspiration the deadliest poison known to science?I am told that
in a few minutes of murderous hatred enough of this poisonous
perspiration is exuded from the human body to kill a man.And do
you know that the thought which manifests upon the body in such
deadly poison is just as deadly when sent into the mentality of a
human being?Think what the Church's deadly hatred of so-called
heretics has done in the last nineteen hundred years!Why, millions
have been killed by it alone!"But now," he said, consulting his watch, "I must go.Even a newspaper
man requires a little sleep.And I must make my apology for occupying
the floor to-night to the exclusion of you all.I have gradually been
filling up with these thoughts for some weeks, and I had to let them
out.Hitt," interrupted Father Waite, "I shall soon be ready to report
on those questions of Bible research which you assigned to me.""Well, have you found that Jesus really was
an historical character, or not?""I think," said Carmen, "that he has found that it really matters
little whether there ever was such a person as the human man Jesus.The Christ has always lived; and the Christ-principle which the man
Jesus is reported to have revealed to the world is with us, here, now,
and always.It is the principle, rather than the man Jesus, that
concerns us, is it not?""Miss Carmen," interposed Reverend Moore, "Jesus was the incarnate Son
of God, and your remarks concerning him are--"

"Slow up, Pat!""I'll fight that out with
you on the way home."We will take up that question in our next discussion," said Hitt."But, wait; Carmen must give us just a short song before we part."As she passed Hitt, she
squeezed his hand.A few minutes later the little group dispersed,
with the melody of the girl's voice trembling in their souls.CHAPTER 8


For several days Ames reflected, and waited.Judging by the data which
he was able to secure, the Express was eating up money at a fearful
pace.To continue at that rate meant certain financial disaster in the
near future.And yet the publishers of the rejuvenated sheet seemed
never to count the cost of their experiment.Already they had begun
the introduction of innovations that were startling and even
mirth-provoking to staid, conservative publishers in the journalistic
field.To survive the long period necessary for the education of the
public taste to such things as the Express stood for demanded a source
of income no less permanent than La Libertad itself.The Beaubien, of course, in her
crippled financial condition was affording the Express no monetary
assistance.Haynerd's few thousands were long
since dissipated.And
her estate was handled by Ames and Company!And handled, we may add,
in such a manner that Miss Wall knew naught regarding it, except that
she might draw upon it as one dips water from a hillside spring.And as he meditated upon the new paper and its
promoters, there gradually formed within him a consuming desire to see
again the fair young girl who had drawn him so strongly, despite his
mountainous wrath and his flaming desire to crush her when she boldly
faced him in his own house on the night of his grand reception.Why
had he let her escape him then?True, women had
meant little to him, at least in the last few years.But this girl had
seemed to stir within him new emotions, or those long slumbering.He
knew not, coarsely materialistic as was his current thought, that in
him, as in all who came within the radius of her pure affection, she
had swept chords whose music he had never heard before.And then one morning he took down
the receiver and called up the office of the Express.Hitt was not there--but this was his assistant.And:

"You didn't want to see Mr.Ames nearly dropped the receiver in his astonishment.In the first
place, the girl had read his thought; and in the second, he was not
accustomed to being told that he might go to see people--they came
cringing to him."You may come at twelve-fifteen," continued the clear, firm voice."And remain a half hour; I'm very busy."Ames put down the instrument and looked about, thankful that no one
was there to comment on his embarrassment.Then he leaned back in his
chair and went slowly over in thought the experiences of that eventful
night in his house.Why, this slip of a girl--a half-breed Indian at
best--this mere baby--!But he glanced up at the great electric wall
clock, and wished it were then twelve-fifteen.*       *       *       *       *

At noon Ames, jauntily swinging his light walking stick, strolled
casually into the office of the Express.His air was one of supreme
confidence in his own powers.And
the knowledge rendered him unafraid of God, man, or beast.He had met
and conquered everything mundane, excepting this young girl.But that
thought was now delightful to him.In her he had unearthed a real
novelty, a ceaseless interest.She scratched and nettled him; but she was as nothing in his grasp.The first thing that impressed him on entering the office was the air
of prosperity which hung over the place.The environment, he mentally
commented, was somewhat unusual for a newspaper plant.Order, quiet,
and cleanliness were dominant notes in the prevailing harmony.He
first walked back into the pressroom to see if the same conditions
prevailed there.Then he retraced his steps, and at length came to a
halt before a door bearing the inscription, "Miss Ariza," on the
glass.Turning the knob, he peered curiously in.The room was small, but light and airy.Its furnishings were new, and
its walls had been freshly tinted.A few pictures of good quality hung
about them.At the desk, bending
over a new typewriter, sat Carmen."I beg pardon," said Ames, hesitating in the doorway."You don't mind if I finish
this article, do you?""It's got
to go to the compositors right away.""Certainly--don't stop," replied Ames easily."When we talk I want
your undivided attention.""Oh, you're sure to get it," she returned, laughing.He sat back in his chair and watched her closely.Yet, there was just a slight tint in her skin, he thought.Perhaps the report that she was a mulatto was not wholly unfounded,
although the strain must have been greatly mixed.He wanted to bend over and take it in his own.Then he suddenly remembered what the Beaubien had once told him--that
she always seemed to be a better woman in this girl's presence.Could he go on persecuting the
harassed woman?But he wouldn't, if--

"There!"said the girl, with what seemed to be a little sigh of
relief.She pressed a button, and handed the typewritten sheets to the
boy who responded.Then, turning to Ames:

"You've come to apologize, haven't you?Well, he certainly had not had any such intention when he
came in.In fact, he knew not just why he was there."You see, Congressman Wales didn't vote for the unaltered schedule.And so everything's all right, isn't it?""No vote has been taken," he said, a dull anger
rising within him."Oh, you are mistaken," replied the girl."The bill was voted out of
committee an hour ago.Here's the wire,
showing the alterations made.Ames read the message, and handed it back.Beyond the clouding of his
features he gave no indication of his feelings."So, you see," continued the girl, "that incident is closed--for all
time, isn't it?"Then:

"Rather odd, isn't it?"he commented, turning quite away from that
subject, and glancing about, "that one with the high ideals you
profess should be doing newspaper work.""There is nothing so
practical as the ideal, for the ideal is the only reality.""Well, just what, may I ask, are you trying to do here?""Run a newspaper on a basis of _practical_ Christianity," she
answered, her eyes dancing."Just as all business will have to be
conducted some day."she said, "to the carnal mind."The laughter abruptly ceased, and he looked keenly at her.But there
was no trace of malice in her fair face as she steadily returned the
look.Well, I'll wager you won't get a dollar back on your investment
for years."We are not measuring our profits
in money!""And your investment--let's see," he mused, trying to draw her out."You've put into this thing a couple of hundred thousand, eh?""I'll tell you," she said, "because money is the only
measure you have for estimating the worth of our project.Hitt has
put more than that amount already into the Express."Quite a little for you people to lose, eh?""You will have to change your tone if you remain here, Mr.You who owe your fellow-men what you can
never, never repay?Ames, there is no man in this whole wide
world, I think, who is so terribly, hopelessly in debt as you!"Why, I don't owe a dollar to any man!"she queried, bending a little closer to him."You do not owe
Madam Beaubien the money you are daily filching from her?Gannette the money and freedom of which you robbed him?You do not owe anything to the thousands of miners and mill hands who
have given, and still give, their lives for you?You do not owe for
the life which you took from Mrs.You do not owe for
the souls which you have debauched in your black career?For the human
wreckage which lies strewn in your wake?Haynerd
for the Social Era which you stole from him?"Ames remained rigid and quiet while the girl spoke.And when she had
finished, and they sat looking squarely into each other's eyes, the
silence was like that which comes between the sharp click of lightning
and the crash of thunder which follows.If it had been a man who thus
addressed him, Ames would have hurled him to the floor and trampled
him.As it was, he rose slowly, like a black storm-cloud mounting
above the horizon, and stood over the girl.She looked up into his face dauntlessly and smiled."Sit down," she
quietly said.Don't threaten, please," she
continued."It wouldn't do any good, for I am not a bit afraid of you.A faint smile began to play about Ames's mouth.Then he twitched his
shoulders slightly."I--I got up," he said, with an assumption of
nonchalance, "to--to read that--ah, that motto over there on the
wall."He went slowly to it and, stooping, read aloud:

               "Lift up the weak, and cheer the strong,
               Defend the truth, combat the wrong!You'll find no scepter like the pen
               To hold and sway the hearts of men.""That was written by your Eugene Field," offered the girl."Now read
the one on the opposite side.It is your _Tekel Upharsin_."He went to the one she indicated, and read the spiritual admonition
from Bryant:

          "Leave the vain, low strife
          That makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power--
          The passions and the cares that wither life,
          And waste its little hour.""Now," continued the girl, "that is only a suggestion to you of the
real handwriting on the wall.I put it there purposely, knowing that
some day you would come in here and read it."Ames turned and looked at her in dumb wonder, as if she were some
uncanny creature, possessed of occult powers.Then the significance of
her words trickled through the portals of his thought."You mean, I suppose," he said, "that if I am not persuaded by the
second motto I shall feel the force of the first, as it sways you,
eh?"Ames," she replied steadily, "that the world is entering
upon a new era of thought, and that your carnal views and methods
belong to a day that is past.This century has no place for them; it
wearies of the things you represent; you are the epitome of that evil
which must have its little hour of night before the reality dawns.""Am I to understand," he
asked, "that the Express, under its new management, is about to turn
muck-raker, and shovel mud at us men of wealth?""We are not considering the Express now, Mr."It
is I alone who am warning you.""Do Hitt and Haynerd bring against me the charges which you voiced a
moment ago?And do you intend to make the columns of your paper spicy
with your comments on my character and methods?I verily believe you
are declaring war!""We are in the business of declaring truth, Mr.It will not shield you when
you are the willing tool of evil, nor will it condone your methods at
any price."Very well," he replied with a bantering smile."I came over
here this noon to get the policy of your paper.Ames," she returned, "is the challenge which evil
always finds in good."I like a good enemy, and an honest one.Who's your general, Hitt or Haynerd?"Then he recovered himself, and
laughed."Do you know," he said, bending close to her, "I admire you _very_
much.Now let's see if we can't get
together on terms of peace.The world hasn't used you right, and I
don't blame you for being at odds with it.I've wanted to talk with
you about this for some time.The pin-headed society hens got jealous
and tried to kill you.But, if you'll just say the word, I'll set you
right up on the very pinnacle of social prestige here.I'll take you
by the hand and lead you down through the whole crowd of 'em, and
knock 'em over right and left!I'll make you the leading woman of the
city; I'll back the Express; we'll make it the biggest newspaper in
the country; I'll make you and your friends rich and powerful; I'll
put you in the place that is rightfully yours, eh?He was bending ever nearer, and his hand closed over hers when he
concluded.His eyes were looking eagerly into her face, and a smile,
winning, enticing, full of meaning, played about his lips.Carmen returned his smile, but withdrew her hand."I'll join you," she
said, "on one condition.""Go; sell that thou hast; and give to the poor.Then come, take up the
cross, and follow--my leader."He straightened up, and a sneer curled his lips."I suppose," he
coarsely insinuated, "that you think you now have material for an
illuminating essay on my conversation."The man's facial muscles twitched slightly under the sting, but he
retained his outward composure."My dear girl," he said, "it probably
has not occurred to you that the world regards the Express as utterly
without excuse for existence.It says, and truly, that a wishy-washy
sheet such as it, with its devitalized, strained, and bolted reports
of the world's vivid happenings, deserves to go under from sheer lack
of interest.The experiment has been tried before, and has signally
failed.But, say the word,
and--"

"And your money, as well as your business ideals, will be ours?"Ames," she said, "you have no ideals.No man who amasses millions
by taking advantage of the world's inhuman and pernicious social
system can have ideals worthy of the name.To apply your methods, your
thought, to the Express would result in sinking its moral tone into
the dust.As for your money--"

"Commit suicide, then!"cried the man, yielding to his rising anger."Let the Express go down, carrying you and your spineless associates
with it!But, remember, you will be the sole cause of its ruin, and
theirs!"Carmen rose quietly and opened the office door."Your half hour is up,
Mr.Ames," she said, glancing at the little clock on her desk; "and I
must return to my work."For a moment the huge man stood looking down darkling upon the girl.He would have given his soul if he could have clasped that slender
form in his arms!A sudden impulse assailed him, and bade him fall
upon his knees before her, and ask her forgiveness and guidance.She
stood waiting--perhaps just for that, and always with that same smile
into which no one had ever yet read aught but limitless love.Carmen hastened to answer the call.Yes--yes--the cotton schedule was reported out
quite changed--yes, an hour ago!"*       *       *       *       *

"Dearie," said the Beaubien at evening, as Carmen seated herself in
that woman's lap and wound her arms about her neck, "I am afraid for
you.""Well, mother dearest," replied the girl, giving her a tighter
squeeze, "that is a sheer waste of time.If you haven't anything more
to occupy you than fear, you'd better come down to the office, and
I'll set you to work.""But--you have defied him--as he says, declared war--"

"No, dearest, not that.It is the carnal mind, using him as a channel,
that has declared war against good.But evil is not power; nor has it
been given power by God.My one thought is this: Am I doing that which
will result in the greatest good to the greatest number?Not as evil would
want to be served, but as good.If my mental attitude is right, then
God's law becomes operative in all that I do, and I am protected."I know, dearie, but--there's the telephone!Oh, I do hope they don't
want you!"Carmen answered the call, and returned with the announcement that
Haynerd was in distress."Sidney Ames is--not there," she said.Now don't worry,
dearest; I--I won't go alone."A moment later she gave the
Beaubien a kiss, and hurried out into the night.In half an hour she
stood at Haynerd's desk."Here I
am, tied down, depending on Sid, and he's drunk!"Haynerd looked up at her, and hesitated."Mass meeting, over on the
East Side.Here's the address," taking up a slip of paper."Open
meeting, I'm told; but I suspect it's an I. W. W. affair.he
said, replying to a telephone call.The Ames mills at
Avon closed down this afternoon?He hung up the receiver and turned to Carmen."That's what this
meeting is about," he said significantly."Four thousand hands
suddenly thrown out at the Avon mills.Sidney Ames slouched into the editor's office and sank heavily into a
chair."Look here," he said, in
sudden desperation, "that fellow's got to be sobered up, now!Or
else--"

Another call came, this time from the Beaubien.Haynerd eagerly gave the
address over the 'phone, and bade him start at once."Now," he said, nodding at Carmen, and jerking his thumb over his
shoulder toward the intoxicated reporter, "it's up to you."Carmen rose at once and went to the lad."Come, Sidney," she said,
taking his hand.The boy roused dully, and shuffled stupidly after the girl into her
own little office.Carmen switched on the lights and closed the door.Then she went to
the limp, emaciated form crumpled up in a chair, and sat down beside
it."Sidney," she said, taking his hand, "there is but one habit--the
habit of righteousness.That is the habit that you are going to wear
now."Outside, the typewriters clicked, the telephones tinkled, and the
linotypes snapped.There were quick orders; men came and went
hurriedly; but there was no noise, no confusion.Haynerd toiled like a
beaver; but his whole heart was in his work.Carmen's little room voiced the sole discordant note that night.And
as the girl sat there, holding the damp hand of the poor victim, she
thanked her God that the lad's true individuality was His pure
thought of him.*       *       *       *       *

At dawn Sidney Ames awoke.A rosy-tinted glow lay over the little
room, and the quiet form at his side seemed an ethereal presence.A
gentle pressure from the hand that still clasped his brought a return
of his earthly sense, and he roused up.The gentle voice sounded to him like distant music."I--you--you brought me in here last night--but--" His hands closed
about the little one that lay in his grasp."You--haven't sat
here--with me--all night?"With a low moan the boy buried his face in her arms, and burst into a
flood of bitter tears."It isn't real, Sidney," she whispered, twining an arm about his neck.For some moments the lad sobbed out his shame and misery.Carmen
stroked his fair hair, and drew him closer to her, while tears of love
and pity coursed down her own cheeks.he cried,
struggling to his feet, while his eyes shone with a wild light.He started for the door, but Carmen darted past him and stood with her
back against it, facing him.she cried, holding her
hands against him._God reigns
here!_"

She turned the lock as he hesitated; then took his arm and led him,
trembling and shivering, back to his chair."We are going to meet this, Sidney, you and I," she whispered, bending
over the shaking form.The suffering lad shook his head and buried his face in his hands."You can't," he moaned; "you can't--I'm _gone!_" His voice died into a
tremble of hopeless despair, of utter surrender.She had faced many trying situations in her brief
life-experience; but, though she met it with dauntless courage and
knew its source, the insidious suggestion now persisted that the eyes
of her people were upon her, and that by this would stand or fall
their faith.Aye, the world was watching her now, keen-eyed and
critical.Would she give it cause to say she could not prove her faith
by her works?And then came the divine message that bade her "Know that I am
God!"--that bade her know that responsibility lay not upon her
shoulders, but upon the Christ for whom she was now called to
witness.To see, or permit the world to see, this mountainous error,
this heaped-up evil, as real and having power, meant a denial of the
Christ and utter defeat.It meant a weary retracing of her own steps,
and a long night of spiritual darkness to those whose eyes had been
upon her."Sidney," she said, turning to the sunken boy at her side, "you are
right, the old man _is_ gone.And now we are going to create 'new
heavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered nor
come into mind'--as thought.Underneath are the everlasting arms, and
you have sunk down, down, down, until at last you rest upon them, and
you find that you haven't sunk at all, and that you couldn't possibly
get away from that infinite Love that is always drawing you to
itself!"She put her arm again about the lad, and drew him toward her."Listen,
Sidney dear, I am standing with you--and with me is omnipotent God!His arm is not shortened, that it can not save you from the pit of
spiritual oblivion into which human thought would seem to make you
think you had fallen, engulfed by the senses."The boy raised his head and looked at her through his bloodshot eyes.he whispered hoarsely; "you don't understand--"

"It is just because I _do_ understand, Sidney, that I am able to help
you," she interrupted quickly."It--it isn't only whiskey--it's--" his head sank again--"it's--morphine!"It's got the false thought that seems to call itself 'you,'" she
said.We'll
cling to them no longer, but shake them off for good.For good, I
said, Sidney--and that means, for _God_!"If there were a God, I shouldn't be
where I am now.""Then I will know it for you," she softly answered."And you are now
right where you belong, in Him.My
parents didn't teach it to their children.And when I tried to learn,
my father kicked me into the street!""Then, Sidney, I'll teach you.For I am in the world just to show what
love will do.""My father--it's his fault--all his fault!"cried the boy, flaring up
and struggling to rise.It's his fault
that I'm a sot and a drug fiend!""It is hate, Sidney, that manifests in slavery, in sodden brains, and
shaking nerves.You don't hate your father; the hate is against your
thought of him; and that thought is all wrong."I used to drink--some, when I lived at home," the boy went on, still
dwelling on the thoughts that held him chained."But he could have
saved me.And then I fell in love--I thought it was love, but it
wasn't.The woman was--she was years older than I. When she left the
city, I followed her.And when I found out what she was, and came back
home, my father threw me out--cut me off--God!""Never mind, Sidney," the girl whispered.But
she realized that the boy must voice the thoughts that were tearing
his very soul, and she suffered him, for it uncovered to her the
hidden sources of his awful malady."And then I drank, drank, drank!""And I lay in the
gutters, and in brothels, and--then, one day, Carlson told me to come
and work for him.And so I went to a
doctor, and he--God curse him!--he injected morphine into my arm to
sober me.And that taught me that I could drink all I wanted to, and
sober up on morphine.But then I learned--I found--"

He stopped, and began to fumble in his pockets.His eyes became wilder
as he searched.He caught her wrist and twisted
it painfully."I am not
afraid to see evil seem to have power!"Then aloud: "I know what you
are searching for, Sidney.Listen, and I will give it
to you.It is in love--right here--the Christ-principle, that is bigger far
than the demons that seem to tear you!I have _all_ power from God,
and you, evil, _can not touch me_!"The boy started at the ringing voice, and loosened his grasp.Then he
sank back into his chair, shaking as with palsy.We
don't have to struggle--we don't have to fight--we only have to
_know_.All that you are wrestling with is the world-wide belief that
there is a power apart from God!_There is none!_ Any claim that there
is such a power is a lie!There is no power or intelligence in whiskey or morphine!The Christ-principle will save you!There
is nothing beyond its reach, not even your problem!"It is a problem, that's all, Sidney," she went on, as he became
calmer.Will you put yourself in my charge,
in my care, and let me meet it for you?"She bent over him and looked
eagerly into his drawn face."We are not going to fight," she continued."We are not going to
resist evil as the world does, and so make it real.I know, dear, just
how pressing your need is.I know how
awfully real it seems to you.But trust me, as I trust the Christ.For a few moments they sat together, hand in hand."I am going to
take you home with me.I am going to keep you right with me, right
under my thought.I'm going to be the mirror, constantly with you,
that reflects infinite love to you every moment.Don't think of anything
else now, excepting that God has your hand and is leading you."She took his arm and drew him, unresisting, yet uncomprehending, to
the door.As she opened it, she looked up into his face and smiled.she cried, shifting her grasp to his hand.And I shall not turn you over to yourself again until the problem
is solved!"Hitt met them as they came out of the room."Well," he said, "I've
kept Madam Beaubien informed as well as I could."We'll be back at three--perhaps."*       *       *       *       *

But at three that afternoon the Beaubien telephoned to Hitt that
Carmen would not be down."She will not leave the boy," the woman said."She holds him--I don't
know how.And I know he is trying desperately to help her.But--I
never saw any one stand as she does!Lewis is here, but he doesn't
interfere.We're going to put a bed in his room, and Sidney will sleep
there.Haynerd stormed; but the tempest was all on the surface."I know, I
know," he said, in reply to Hitt's explanation."That boy's life is
more to her than a million newspapers, or anything else in the
universe just at present.The devil can't look her in the
face!I--I wish I were--What are you standing there for?In the little Beaubien cottage that afternoon the angry waves of human
fear, of human craving, of hatred, wrath, and utter misery mounted
heaven-high, and fell again.As the
night-shadows gathered, Sidney Ames, racked and exhausted, fell into a
deep sleep.Then Carmen left his bedside and went into the little
parlor, where sat the Beaubien and Father Waite."Here," she said, handing a hypodermic needle and a vial of tablets to
the latter.And now," she continued, "you must
work with me, and stand--firm!Sidney's enemies are those of his own
mental household.We have got to
uproot from his consciousness the thought that alcohol and drugs are a
power.Hatred and self-condemnation, as well as self-love, voiced in a
sense of injury, are other mental enemies that have got to be driven
out, too.It is all mental, every
bit of it!You have got to know that, and stand with me.We are going
to prove the Christ-principle omnipotent with respect to these seeming
things."But," she added, after a moment's pause, "you must not watch this
error so closely that it can't get away.For if
you do, you make a reality of it--and then, well--"

"The case is in your hands, Carmen," said Father Waite gently."We
know that Jesus would cure this boy instantly, if he were here--"

"Well--the Christ _is_ here!""Put
away your 'ifs' and 'buts.'"And these," he said, holding out the
needle and vial, "shall we have further use for them?""It will be given us what we are to do and say," she returned.CHAPTER 9


Four weeks from that crisp morning when Carmen led the bewildered,
stupified lad to her home, she and Sidney sat out upon the little
porch of the cottage, drinking in the glories of the winter sun.January was but half spent, and the lad and girl were making the most
of the sudden thaw before the colder weather which had been predicted
might be upon them.What these intervening weeks had been to Carmen, none might have
guessed as she sat there with the sunlight filtering in streamlets of
gold through her brown hair.But their meaning to the boy might have
been read with ease in the thin, white face, turned so constantly
toward his fair companion.They were deeply, legibly written there,
those black nights, when he would dash out into the hall, determined
to break through the windows of the nearest dram shop and drink,
drink, drink, until the red liquor burst from his eyes, his mouth, his
nostrils!Those ghastly nights, when Carmen would stand before him,
her arms outspread across the door, and beat back the roaring devils
within him!Those long days of agonized desire for the vicious drug
which had sapped his manhood!Those fell hours, when low curses poured
from his burning lips upon her and upon all mankind!Those cold,
freezing sweats, and the dry, cracking fever!Those hours when, with
Carmen always by his side, he tramped mile after mile through drifts
and ice, until he dropped at length from sheer exhaustion, only to
awake, hours later, to find that the girl had brought him home, safe,
unharmed!--

And then, oh, the "Peace, be still!"which he began to hear, faint at
first, but growing in volume, until, at last, it became a mighty,
thunderous command, before which the demons paled and slunk away,
never to return!Oh, the tears of agony that had given way to tears of
joy, of thanksgiving!Oh, the weakness that had been his strength!And, oh, the devotion of this fair girl--aye, and of her associates,
too--but all through her!Had she proved her God before the eyes of
the world?Day after day, clad in the impenetrable armor
of her love, she had stood at this struggling lad's side, meeting the
arrows of death with her shield of truth!Night after night she had
sat by his couch, her hand crushed in his desperate grasp, flouting
the terror that stalked before his delirious gaze!What work she had
done in those long weeks, none would ever know; but the boy himself
knew that he had emerged from the valley of the shadow of death with a
new mind, and that she had walked with him all the dark, cloud-hung
way.As they sat there in the bright sunlight that morning, their thought
was busy with the boy's future.Old plans, old ambitions, had seemed
to lift with the lifting of the mortal curse which had rested upon
him, and upward through the ashes of the past a tender flower of hope
was pushing its way.The last tie which
bound him to his family had been severed by his own father two weeks
before, when the shadow of death fell athwart his mother's brilliant
path.J. Wilton Ames, delicate in health when recalled from
abroad, and still suffering from the fatigue of the deadly social
warfare which had preceded her sudden flight from her husband's
consuming wrath, had failed to rally from the indisposition which
seized her on the night of the grand Ames reception.For days she
slowly faded, and then went quickly down under a sharp, withering
attack of pneumonia.A few brief weeks after the formal opening of the
Ames palace its mistress had sighed away her blasted hopes, her vain
desires, her petty schemes of human conquest and revenge, and had gone
to face anew her problems on another plane of mortal thought.It was
rumored by the servants that, in her last hours, when she heard the
rustle of the death angel's wings beside her, a great terror had
stricken her, and she had called wildly for that son whom she had
never cared to know.It was whispered that she had begged of her
husband to seek the lad and lead him home; that she had pleaded with
him to strive, with the boy, to find the better things of life; that
she had begged him to warn and be warned of her present sufferings, as
she lay there, stripped of every earthly aid, impoverished in heart,
in soul, in mind, with her hands dusty and begrimed with the ashes of
this life's mocking spoils.What truth lay hidden in her mad ravings about the parentage of
Carmen, and her confused, muttered references to Monsignor Lafelle, no
one knew.But of those who stood about her bedside there was none who
could gainsay the awed whisperings of the servants that this haughty
leader of the great city's aristocracy had passed from this life into
the darkness beyond in pitiable misery and terror.The news of his mother's death had come at a time when the boy was
wild with delirium, at an hour when Waite, and Hitt, and Carmen stood
with him in his room and strove to close their ears against the
shrieking of the demon that was tearing him.Hitt at once called up
Willett, and asked for instructions.A few minutes later came the
message that the Ames house was forever barred against the wayward
son.And it was not until this bright winter morning, when the lad
again sat clothed and in his right mind, that Carmen had gently broken
the news to him."I never knew her," the boy had said at length, rousing from his
meditations."Few of the rich people's children know their parents.I
was brought up by nurses and tutors.I never knew what it was to put
my arms around my mother, and kiss her.And often I would plan to surprise her by suddenly running into her
arms and embracing her.But then, when I would see her, she was always
so far away, so cold, so beautifully dressed.And she seldom spoke to
me, or to Kathleen, until we were grown up.And by that time I was
running wild.And then--then--"

"There!"admonished Carmen, reaching over and taking his hand."That's
in our little private cemetery, you know.The old error is dead, and
we are not going to dig it up and rehearse it, are we?""I'm like a little baby," he said sadly."I'm just
beginning to live.And you are my mother, the only one I've ever
known.""Let me be your sister," she said."We are so
near of an age, you know.""You are my angel," he murmured."What have I told you
so often that Jesus said?'Of mine own self I can do nothing.'It was--" her voice sank to a whisper--"it was the
Christ-principle.It worked through him as a channel; and it worked
through me.""You're going to teach me all about that," he said, again pressing her
hand to his lips."You won't cast me adrift yet, will you, little
sister?"Why, you're still mine, you
know!I haven't given you back to yourself yet, have I?But now let's
talk about your work.If you want to write, you are going to, and you
are going to write _right_.""Back to the Express," she said lightly."I haven't written a word for
it now for a month.And how dear, funny old Ned has scolded!""You--you dropped everything--your work--all--for a poor, worthless
hulk like me," he sighed."Sidney dear," the girl replied.Everything I do is '_as unto Him_.'I would have done the same for
anybody, whether I knew the person or not.I saw, not you, but the
human need--oh, such a need!And the Christ-principle made me a human
channel for meeting it, that is all.Drop my work, and my own
interests!Why, Sidney, what is anything compared with meeting human
needs?Didn't Jesus drop everything and hurry out to meet the sick and
the suffering?Was money-making, or society, or personal desire, or
worldly pleasure anything to him when he saw a need?You don't seem to
understand that this is what I am here for--to show what love will
do.""I--I guess I know only the world's idea of love.""And that is love's counterfeit, self-love, sentimentalism,
sex-mesmerism, and all that," she added."But now, back to your work
again.You're going to write, write, write!My, but the world is
hungry for _real_ literature!Your yearning to meet that need is a
sign of your ability to do it.But, remember, everything that comes to
you comes from within.You are, in fact, a miner; and your mine is
your mind; and that is unlimited, for God is the only mind, infinite
and omnipresent.We
never fear a real thing; we fear only our false thoughts of things.Always those thoughts are absolutely wrong, and we wake up and find
that we were fearing only fear-thoughts themselves.Now destroy the chains of fear which limit your thought,
and God will issue!"Well," without waiting for his reply, "now you have reached that
plane of thought where you don't really care for what the world has to
offer you.You have ceased to want to be rich, or famous.You are not
afraid to be obscure and poor.You have learned, at least in part,
that the real business of this life lies in seeking good, in
manifesting and expressing it in every walk, and in reflecting it
constantly to your fellow-men.Having learned that, you are ready to
live.Remember, there is no luck, no such thing as chance.The cause
of everything that can possibly come to you lies within yourself.The thought that you allow to enter
your mentality and become active there, later becomes externalized.Be, oh, so careful, then, about your thought, and the basis upon which
it rests!For, in your writing, you have no right to inflict false
thought upon your credulous fellow-mortals.""But," he replied, "we are told that in literature we must deal with
human realities, and with things as they are.The human mind exists,
and has to be dealt with.""The human mind does not exist, Sidney, except as supposition.The world still awaits the one who will show
it things as they _really_ are.Human realities, so-called, are the
horrible, ghastly unrealities of carnal thought, without any basis of
the divine Christ-principle.I know, we are told that the great books
of the world are those which preserve and interpret its life.is
it true greatness to detail, over and over again in endless recital,
the carnal motives of the human mind, its passions and errors, its
awful mesmerism, its final doom?Yes, perhaps, on one condition: that,
like a true critic, you picture human concepts only to show their
unreality, their nothingness, and to show how they may be overcome.""But most books--"

"Ah, yes, most books are written only to amuse the dispirited human
mind for a brief hour, to make it forget for a moment its troubles.They are literary narcotics; they are sops to jaded appetites, that's
all.A book, for example, that pictures an injured man discovering a
great treasure, and then using it to carry out his schemes of
revenge--well, what influence for good has such a work?It is only a
stimulus to evil, Sidney.But had it shown him using that great wealth
to bless his persecutors and turn them from their mesmerism to real
life and good--"

"Such things don't happen in this world, Carmen.""But they could, and should, Sidney dear.Then will come the new literature, the literature of _good_!And it
will make people think, rather than relieve them from the ennui of
solid thought, as our present novels do.The intellectual palate then
will find only insipidity in such books as pour from our presses now.The ability to converse glibly about authors who wallow in human
unrealities will then no longer be considered the hall-mark of
culture.Culture in that day will be conformity to truth.""Little sister," he said,
"you are a beautiful idealist.""But," came her quick reply, "are you not a living illustration of the
practicability of my idealism, Sidney?"The boy choked, and tears filled his eyes.Carmen stole an arm about
him."The most practical man who ever lived, Sidney dear, was Jesus.He had ideas that differed very
radically from other people's, but he did not hide them for fear of
giving offense.He was not afraid to shock people with the truth about
themselves.He tore down, yes; but he then reconstructed, and on a
foundation of demonstrable truth.He was not afraid to defy the
Rabbis, the learned, and the puffed-up.He did not bow abjectly before
the mandarins and pedagogues.Had he done so, and given the people
what they wanted and were accustomed to, they would have made him a
king--and his mission would have been a dead failure!""And for that they slew him," returned the boy."It is the cowardly fear of slaughter, Sidney, that keeps people from
coming out and standing for what they know to be right to-day.You are
not one of those cravens.""But the people who do that, Carmen, are called demagogues and
muck-rakers!""And the muck-rakers, Sidney, have made a sorry mess,
haven't they?They destroy without ruth, but seldom, if ever, put
forth a sane suggestion for the betterment of conditions.They traffic
in sensationalism, carping criticism, and abuse.'To find fault,' said
Demosthenes, 'is easy, and in every man's power; but to point out the
proper remedy is the proof of a wise counselor.'The remedy which I
point out, Sidney, is the Christ-principle; and all I ask is that
mankind seek to demonstrate it, even as Jesus bade us do.He was a
success, Sidney, the greatest success the world has ever known.Because he followed ideals with utter loyalty--because he voiced
truth without fear--because he made his business the service of
humanity.He took his work seriously, not for money, not for human
preferment, but for mankind.And his work bears the stamp of
eternity.""You're _not_ afraid, Sidney!""Oh, why
does the human mind always look for and expect that which it does not
want to see come or happen!"The boy laughed heartily at the quick sally of her delightfully
quotidian thought."You didn't let me finish," he said."I was going
to say that I'm afraid if I write and speak only of spiritual things I
shall not be understood by the world, nor even given a hearing.""Well, don't use that word 'afraid.'how the human mind clings to
everything, even words, that express its chief bogy, fear."And yet, has anything, written or
spoken, ever endured as his spiritual teachings?The present-day novel
or work of fiction is as fleeting as the human thought it attempts to
crystallize.Of the millions of books published, a handful endure.Those are they which illustrate the triumph of good over evil in human
thought.And the greatest of such books is the Bible.""Well, I'm hunting for a subject now."It will drive you to the task of transcribing it.Sidney--perhaps I can give you the subject!Perhaps I am the channel for this, too!""Well," bending over closer to her,
"what is it, little sister?"The girl looked out over the dripping shrubs and the soft snow.She saw a man, a priest, she knew not
where, but delving, plodding, digging for the truth which the human
mind has buried under centuries and centuries of material _debris_.She saw him, patiently bearing his man-made burden, striving to shield
a tender, abandoned girl, and to transfer to her his own great worldly
knowledge, but without its dross.She saw the mighty sacrifice, when
the man tore her from himself, and thrust her out beyond the awful
danger in which he dwelt.It was love--aye, the love that alone makes men great, the love
that lays down human life in self-immolating service.I will tell
you the whole beautiful story.It is an illustration of the way love
works through human channels.And perhaps--perhaps, some day, the book
may reach him--yes, some day.And it will tell him--oh, Sidney, it
will tell him that I know, and that I love him, love him, love him!"*       *       *       *       *

In the office of the manager of the Express three heads were close
together that morning, and three faces bore outward evidence of the
serious thought within."Miss Wall tells me, Ned," Hitt was saying, "that her father used to
be associated with Ames, and that, at his demise, he left his estate,
badly entangled, for Ames to settle.Now it transpires that Ames has
been cunning enough to permit Miss Wall to draw upon his bank almost
without limit, he making up any deficit with his own personal notes.""I think I see the shadow of his fine hand!""And now," resumed Hitt, "she is given to understand that Ames has
been obliged by the bank examiner to withdraw his personal notes as
security for her deficits, and that the revenue from her estate must
be allowed to accrue to the benefit of the Ames bank until such time
as all obligations are met.""In other words, Elizabeth is simply
cut off!"And now, another thing: Madam Beaubien's lawyer called on
her to-day, and informed her that Hood had gone into court and secured
an injunction, tying up all revenue from her estate until it can be
unraveled."Ames is out to do up
the Express, eh?""There is no doubt of it, Ned," returned Hitt seriously."And to
utterly ruin all connected with it.""Then, by God, we'll fight him to the last ditch!""I think you forget, Ned, that we have a lady with us," nodding toward
Miss Wall, "and that you are seriously trying to reform, for Carmen's
sake.""I beg your pardon, Elizabeth," said Haynerd meekly."I really am
trying to be decent, you know.But when I think of Ames it's like a
red rag to a bull!""Of course," Hitt continued, "oil still flows from our paternal wells.But in order to raise money at once I shall be obliged either to sell
my oil holdings or mortgage them.They have got to take care of us all
now, including Madam Beaubien."There's another anomaly: while Ames is trying to
ruin us, that girl is saving his son."I--I beg your pardon,
Elizabeth.The fact is, either you or I will have to retire from this
meeting, for I'm getting mad.I like to hear your sulphurous
language to-day.It helps to express my own feelings," replied the
woman."The circulation of the Express," Hitt went on, "is entirely
artificial.Our expense is tremendous, and our revenue slight.And
still Carmen insists on branching out and putting into practical form
her big ideas.Limitation is a word that is not in her vocabulary!""Hitt, can't we fight Ames with his own fire?"Ames is very cunning," answered Hitt."When he learned that the
cotton schedule had been altered in the Ways and Means Committee, he
promptly closed down his Avon mills.Then
he resumed, but on half time.I presume
he will later return to full time, but with a reduced scale of wages.This
way: he will force a strike at Avon--a February strike--four thousand
hands out in the cold.Meantime, he'll influence every other spinner
in the country to do likewise.Now, can
Congress stand up against that sort of argument?And, besides, he will
grease the palms of a large number of our dignified statesmen, you may
be sure!"Hitt," said Miss Wall, "I suggest that you send Carmen to Avon at
once.I know of no one who can get to the bottom of things as she can.Let her collect the facts regarding the situation down there, and
then--"

"Send her first to Washington!""Have her hang
around the lobbies of the Capitol for a while, and meet a lot of those
old sap-heads.What information she won't succeed in worming out of
them isn't in 'em, that's all!""But," objected Hitt, "if she knew that we would use her information
for a personal attack upon Ames, she'd leave us.""There's no objection to her getting the facts, anyway, is there?"demanded Haynerd, waxing hot again.I'll put a mortgage on my Ohio holdings at once.""I don't think I would be afraid," suggested Miss Wall."We might not
use the information Carmen may collect in Avon or Washington, but
something, I am sure, is bound to come out of it.Something always
comes out of what she does."All well and good," put in Haynerd."And yet, if she finds anybody
down there who needs help, even the President himself, she'll throw
the Express to the winds, just as she did in Sidney's case."No, that's true, Ned, for while we preach she's off somewhere
practicing.We evolve great truths, and she applies and demonstrates
them.But she has saved Sidney--her Christ did it through her.And she
has given the lad to us, a future valuable man.""Sure--if we are to _have_ any future," growled Ned."See here," retorted Hitt, brindling, "have we in our numerous
gatherings at Madam Beaubien's spoken truth or nonsense?If you
believe our report, then accept and apply it.Now who's to go to Avon
with Carmen?"Why, if those Magyars down there
discovered he was Ames's son, they'd eat him alive!"Then, turning to his
companions:

"Waite says he wants a meeting to-night.He'd like to report on his
research work.No
telling when we may get together again, if the girl--" He became
suddenly silent, and sat some time looking vacantly out through the
window."She goes to Avon to-morrow," he abruptly announced, "alone."His
thought had been dwelling on that'something not ourselves' which he
knew was shielding and sustaining the girl.CHAPTER 10


"We have now arrived at a subject whose interest and significance for
us are incalculable," said Father Waite, standing before the little
group which had assembled in their usual meeting place in the first
hours of the morning, for only at that time could Hitt and Haynerd
leave the Express."We have met to discuss briefly the meaning of that
marvelous record of a whole nation's search for God, the Bible.As
have been men's changing concepts of that'something not ourselves
that makes for righteousness,' so have been individuals, tribes, and
nations.The Bible records the development of these concepts in
Israel's thought; it records the unquenchable longings of that people
for truth; it records their prophetic vision, their sacred songs,
their philosophy, their dreams, and their aspirations.To most of us
the Bible has long been a work of profound mystery, cryptical,
undecipherable.And largely, I now believe, because we were wont to
approach it with the bias of preconceived theories of literal, even
verbal, inspiration, and because we could not read into it the record
of Israel's changing idea of God, from a wrathful, consuming Lord of
human caprice and passions, to the infinite Father of love, whom Jesus
revealed as the Christ-principle, which worked through him and through
all who are gaining the true spiritual concept, as is this girl who
sits here on my right with the lad whom you have seen rescued by the
Christ from the pit of hell."His voice choked when he referred to Carmen and Sidney.But he quickly
stifled his emotion, and went on:

"In our last meeting Mr.Hitt clearly showed us how the so-called
human mind has seemed to develop as the suppositional opposite of the
mind that is God; and how through countless ages of human reckoning
that pseudo-mind has been revealing its various types, until at
length, rising ever higher in the scale of being, it revealed its
human man as a mentality whose consciousness is the suppositional
activity of false thought, and which builds, incessantly, mental
concepts out of this kind of thought and posits them within itself as
material objects, as its own body, its universe, its all.And he
showed us how, little by little, that human mind's interpretations of
the infinite mind's true ideas became better, under the divine
infiltration of truth, until at last there developed a type, now known
to us as the Jewish nation, which caught a clearer glimpse of truth,
and became conscious of that'something not ourselves' which makes
for right-thinking, and consequent correct mental concepts and
externalizations.This, then, was the starting point of our religion.These first glimpses of truth, and their interpretations, as set forth
in the writings of the early Jewish nation, constitute the nucleus of
our Bible."But were these records exact statements of truth?The
primitive human mind could only lisp its wonderful glimpses of truth
in legend and myth.And so in fable and allegory the early Israelites
sought to show the power of good over evil, and thereby stimulate a
desire for right conduct, based, of course, on right-thinking.And
thus it is that the most significant thing in their sacred records is
their many, many stories of the triumph of the spiritual over the
material.Their right-thinking
became externalized outwardly in material abundance and physical
comfort.But the people's understanding was not sufficiently great to
shield them from the temptation which material wealth and power always
constitute.The mist of
materialism spread over it.Those wonderful flashes of truth ceased to
dart across their mental horizon.Their god became a magnified concept
of the human man, who dickered with them over the construction of his
temples, and who, by covenants, bribes, and promises, induced them to
behave themselves.And at length the beautiful vision
faded quite away."Then followed four hundred human years, during which the vicissitudes
of the Hebrew nation were many and dark.But during those long
centuries there developed that world wonder, a whole nation's united
longing for a deliverer!The prophets promised a great change in their
fallen fortunes.Though
their concept of Him had grossly degenerated, yet the deliverer would
come, he _must_!In the depths of their night--in the midst of the
heaviest darkness that ever lay over the world--there arose a great
light.Through the densest ignorance of the human mind filtered the
Christ-principle, and was set forth by the channel through which it
came, the man Jesus.Had there been a conference among God, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, to debate the sending of salvation to mankind, as
recorded by the poet Milton?what a crude, materialistic
conception.Had God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son?But God _is_ Love, infinite, unchanging.And His unique Son, the
Christ-principle, available to all mankind, was 'before Abraham.'Had
a great, dimly perceived principle been demonstrated, namely, that,
if we yearn long and earnestly for the right, it comes?Had the Jewish
nation 'demonstrated' the Christ?Had their centuries of looking and
expecting resulted in a saviour being manifested to them?It was a
period in the unfolding of human thought when civilization had reached
its lowest depths.Morality had evaporated to the dregs.Rome was
become the world's harlot.A few years more, and Nero would drag his
vulpine immorality across the stage.Paganism was virtue in comparison
with the lust of men in that dark hour.And yet, in the very midst of
it, appeared the most venerated, the most beloved man in all history,
bearing the Christ-message like a flaming torch!"'Always our being is descending into us,' said Emerson.But our true
being can be none other than infinite mind's idea of itself.Our true
individuality must be the way that mind regards us.And thus it was
that Israel's true being descended, filtering in through the thick
mists of error.That true being was the deliverer, _par excellence_,
for it was the message of truth that bade men deny themselves, their
carnal selves, and know but the one God, infinite mind.That was the
grace sufficient for them, that would have solved their problems, that
would have enabled them to lay off the 'old man' and his woes and
afflictions, and put on the 'new man,' divine mind's image.But the
carnal mind sought a material kingdom.It wanted, not spirit, but
matter.It cruelly rejected the message-bearer, and sought to kill his
message by slaying him on the cross.And thereby the Jewish nation
rent itself asunder, and sank into carnal oblivion.Ah, how they have
been cursed by the crucifixion of Jesus!"Men ask to-day: Did Jesus really live?Or is he a mythical character,
like the gods of pagan Rome?Let us ask, in making our reply, how
truth comes to mankind?Then the great sayings attributed to Jesus at least came from a human
being.Let us go further: it is the common history of mankind that
truth comes to the human mind only after a period of preparation.Not
conscious preparation, necessarily, but, rather, a preparation forced
by events.The truth of a mathematical principle can not come to me
unless I am prepared to receive it.And the greatest good comes to men
only after they have learned the nothingness of the material ambitions
and aims which they have been pursuing.By its own rottenness the
world had been made fallow for truth.The awfulness of its own
exposure in its rampant, unlicensed revels, had shown as never before
the human mind's absolute nothingness--its nothingness as regards real
value, permanence, and genuine good--in that first century of our
so-called Christian era.And when the nothingness of the carnal mind
was made plain, men saw the reality of the truth, as revealed in the
Christ, back of it all.The divine message was whispered to a human
mentality.And that mentality expanded under the God-influence, until
at last it gave to the sin-weary world the Christ-principle of
salvation.Let us call that human mentality, for convenience, the man
Jesus."And now, was he born of a virgin?It
was common enough in his day for virgins to pretend to be with child
by the Holy Ghost; and so we do not criticise those who refuse to
accept the dogma of the virgin birth.But a little reflection in the
light of what we have been discussing throws a wonderful illumination
upon the question.If matter and material modes are real, then we must
at once relegate the stories of the virgin birth, the miracles, the
resurrection, and the ascension to the realm of myth.If the so-called
laws of matter are real, irrefragable laws, then we indulgently, pass
by these stories as figments of heated imaginations.But, regarding
matter as a human, mortal concept, entirely mental, and wholly subject
to the impress and influence of mind, and knowing, as we do now, that
_mental concepts change with changed thought_, we are forced to look
with more favor upon these questions which for centuries caused men to
shed their fellows' blood.Hitt pointed out in our last meeting that mortal beings are
interpretations in mortal or human mind of the infinite mind, God, and
its ideas.The most perfect human interpretation of God's greatest
idea, Man, was Christ Jesus.The _real_ selfhood of every one of us is
God's idea of us.The world calls it the
'soul,' the 'divine essence,' and the 'immortal spark.'The Christ was
the real, spiritual selfhood of the man Jesus.So the Christ is the
real selfhood of each of us.It is not
conceived and brought forth in conformity with human modes.Now was
this great fact externalized in the immaculate conception and birth?It does not grow and decay and pass away in death.It is the 'unique'
Son of God which is back of each one of us.But the world has seen it
only once in its fullness, and then through the man Jesus."Something happened in that first century of the so-called Christian
era--something of tremendous significance.It was the
birth of the Christ-idea into the human consciousness.Was the
Christ-idea virgin-born?Aye, that it was, for God, infinite Mind,
alone was its origin and parent.The speculation which has turned
about that wonderful first century event has dealt with the human
channel through which the Christ-idea flowed to mankind.But let us
see what light our deductions throw even upon that."Referring all things to the realm of the mental, where we now
know they belong, we see that man never fell, but that Israel's idea
of God and man did fall, woefully.We see that the Christ-principle
appeared among men; we see that to-day it works marvels; we must
admit that throughout the ages before Jesus it had done so; we
know now that the great things which Israel is recorded to have
done were accomplished by the Christ-principle working through
men, and that when their vision became obscured they lost the
knowledge of that principle and how to use it.History records the
working of great deeds by that same Christ-principle when it was
re-born in our first century; and we also can see how the obscuring
of the spiritual by the material in the Emperor Constantine's time
caused the loss of the Church's power to do great works.We are
forced to admit the omnipotence, immanence, and eternality of the
Christ-principle, for it is divine mind, God himself.Moses, Elisha,
Elijah, the ancient prophets, all had primitive perceptions of truth,
and all became channels for the passing of the Christ-principle to
mankind in some degree.But none of these men ever illustrated that
principle as did the man Jesus.He is the most marvelous manifestation
of God that has ever appeared among mankind; so true and exact was
the manifestation that he could tell the world that in seeing him
they were actually seeing the Father.It is quite true that many
of his great sayings were not original with him.Great truths have
been voiced, even by so-called pagans, from earliest times.But he
demonstrated and made practical the truth in these sayings.And he
exposed the nothingness of the human mental concept of matter by
healing disease, walking the waves, and in other wonderful ways.It
is true that long before his time Greek philosophers had hit upon the
theory of the nothingness of matter.Plato had said that only ideas
were real.But Jesus--or the one who brought the Christ-message--was
the clearest mentality, the cleanest human window-pane, to quote
Carmen, that ever existed.Through him the divine mind showed with
almost unobscured fullness.God's existence had been discerned and
His goodness proved from time to time by prophets and patriarchs, but
by no means to the extent that Jesus proved it.There were those
before him who had asserted that there was but one reality, and that
human consciousness was not the real self.There were even those who
believed matter to be created by the force of thought, even as in
our own day._But it remained for Jesus to make those ideas
intensely practical, even to the overcoming and dissolution of his
whole material concept of the universe and man._ And it remained
for him to show that the origin of evil is in the lie about God.It
was his mission to show that the devil was 'a man-killer from the
beginning,' because it is the supposition that there is power apart
from God.It was his life purpose to show mankind that there is
nothing in this lie to cause fear, and that it can be overcome by
overcoming the false thought which produces it.By overcoming that
thought he showed men the evanescent nature of sickness and death.And sin he showed to be a missing of the mark through lack of
understanding of what constitutes real good."Turn now again to the Bible, that fascinating record of a whole
people's search for God and their changing concept of Him.Note that,
wherever in its records evil seems to be made real, it is for the
purpose of uncovering and destroying it by the vigorous statements of
truth which you will almost invariably find standing near the
exposition of error.So evil seemed very real in the first century of
our era; but it was uncovered by the coming of Jesus.The exposure of
evil revealed the Christ, right at hand.""But," protested Haynerd, "let's get back to the question of the
virgin birth.""But let us first consider what
human birth is.""Now you are touching my lifelong
question.If I am immortal, where was I before I was born?""Of which 'I' are you speaking, Ned?""The real
'I' is God's image and likeness, His reflection.It was never born,
and never dies.And therefore it will
cease to be.The human mind makes its own laws, and calls them laws of
nature, or even God's laws.Because
God is both Father and Mother to His children, His ideas, the human
mind has decreed in its counterfeiting process that it is itself both
male and female, and that the union of these two is necessary in order
to give rise to another human mind.Do you see how it imitates the
divine in an apish sort of way?And so elements of each sex-type of
the human mind are employed in the formation of another, their
offspring.The process is wholly mental, and is one of human belief,
quite apart from the usage of the divine Mind, who'spake and it was
done,' mentally unfolding a spiritual creation.The real 'you,' Ned,
has always existed as God's idea of Himself.It will come to light as the material 'you' is put off.The
material 'you' did not exist before it was humanly born.It was
produced in supposition by the union of the parent human minds, which
themselves were reflections of the male and female characteristics of
the communal mortal mind.It thus had a definite, supposititious
beginning."And so I'm doomed to annihilation, eh?"Your mortal sense of existence, Ned, certainly is doomed to
extinction.Oh, it doubtless
will not all be destroyed when you pass through that change which we
call death.It may linger until you have passed through many such
experiences.And so it behooves you to set about getting rid of it
as soon as possible, and thus avoid the unpleasant experience of
countless death-throes.You see, Ned, an error in the premise will
appear in the conclusion.Now you are starting with the premise that
the human 'you' is real.All that you reflect of divine mind will
endure permanently, but whatever you reflect of the lie regarding
that mind will pass away.Human beings know nothing of their origin,
nor of their existence._Because there is nothing to know
about them; they are entirely supposititious!_ Paul says, in his
letter to the Romans: 'They which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God.'The birth of the children of the
flesh is wholly a human-mind process.The infant mentality thus
produced knows nothing whatsoever of itself.It has no knowledge; is
not founded on truth.It will later manifest hereditary beliefs,
showing the results of prenatal mesmerism.Then it will receive the
general assortment of human thought and opinion--very little of it
based on actual truth--which the world calls education.Then it
learns to regard itself as an individual, a separate being.And soon
it attributes its origin to God.But the prenatal error will appear
in the result.The being manifests every gradation of human thought;
it grows; it suffers and enjoys materially; it bases its very
existence upon matter; it manifests the false activity of human
thought in material consciousness; and then it externalizes its
beliefs, the consentaneous human beliefs, upon its body and in its
environment; and finally, the activity of the false thought which
constitutes its consciousness ceases--and the being dies.Yes, its
death will be due to sin, to '_hamartio_,' missing the mark.And that, Ned, is human life, so-called."Death is not in any sense a cessation of life.The being who dies
never knew what it was to live.Death is the externalization of
human, mortal beliefs, which are not based upon real knowledge, truth.Paul said: 'They that are after
the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the
spirit the things of the spirit.'In other words, mankind are striving
terribly, desperately, to keep alive a sense of material, fleshly
existence.They are foredoomed to failure,
despite the discovery of antitoxins.In the book of Job we read: 'The
spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given
me life.'Where, then, is the reality in prenatal mesmerism and the
drag of heredity?It is all supposition, all a part of the one lie,
the'man-killer.'"The change called death comes to all mortals.It is the culmination
of the human mind's sense of limitation.It does not usher them into
immortal, illimitable bliss.It but leaves them upon another seeming
plane of mortal thought, there to drag out another sense of existence,
unless they have so learned the lesson which Jesus taught as to enable
them to overcome death.Why, then, do we waste our time
in trivial things; in the heaping up of useless money; in the vain
strife for sensual pleasures?The mortal will live and die, and live
and die, until at last he is beaten into line and forced to
demonstrate the Christ-principle.Hadn't we better begin that right
here and now?Wishing to die doesn't solve our problems.Suicide only
makes us start again, worse off than before.We shall overcome death
when we have overcome sin, for the physical manifestation called death
is but the externalization in conscious experience of spiritual
death--lack of a demonstrable understanding of Life, Truth, Spirit,
which is God, unlimited good.""And the Church, Protestant and Catholic, with their ceremonies, their
Masses, and--"

"They have woefully missed the mark, Ned.But I see protest rising in our good friends, Doctor Siler and
Reverend Moore, so I will hasten on, for we have much ground still to
cover."Now, knowing that birth is a humanly mental process, is it possible
that the man Jesus was 'born of a virgin'?Quite so; but, more, _no
man ever conceived and born in the way human beings are generated has
ever begun to approach Jesus in degree of spirituality_.If he had
been born in human ways, is it likely that he would ever have
developed such intense spirituality?Well, not in a brief thirty-three
years or so!And, on the other hand, if he had come into the world in
some way other than by being born of a woman, would he have been
understandable at all to the human mind?He would have
been wholly in the realm of the mental, far above human perception.If
he had been conceived by the union of the two sexes, as is the
mortal-mind mode of generation, would he not have been too material to
have so quickly developed that spirituality which made him the light
of the world at the age of thirty-three?The theory of the virgin birth at least seems to meet the
need of a sort of middle course, whereby the man should not be too
human to be the channel for the great measure of spirituality with
which he was endowed, and yet should be human enough to be appreciable
to other human minds."Remember, the Jesus who has been reported to us must have regarded
matter as unreal, as nothingness.And
they as plainly show that he came from the Father.His whole life was
such as to render the virgin birth almost a necessity, as I see it.And from a study of the Gospels I
simply can not avoid the conclusion that his knowledge of the allness
of God rendered matter such a nonentity to him that he overcame all
material laws, overcame the world of matter, and even at the last
dematerialized his material body.It's an astonishing thought--and
yet, who can show that it is not true?There are some things that
reason insists on our accepting, despite the paucity of human
records."Waite," said Doctor Morton, "that the Gospels
according to Mark and John make no mention of the virgin birth."And I will go further: Biblical
research during the past few years seems to have established the
conclusion that Mark's Gospel antedates the others, but that prior to
it there existed a collection of sayings by Jesus, called the _Logia_.This collection of sayings seems to have been originally written in
Aramaic, the language Jesus spoke.Now Matthew Arnold tells us that
the Gospel narratives passed through at least fifty years of oral
tradition before they became fixed in the form in which we now have
them.Of course it is quite possible that the story of the virgin
birth arose during those fifty years, for we can imagine how the life
of Jesus was then discussed!Matthew and Luke alone speak of the
virgin birth.Mark's Gospel we believe to have been written by Mark
himself.And we believe that Papias, who wrote about the middle of the
second century, spoke truly when he said: 'Mark having become (or
having been) Peter's interpreter, wrote all that he remembered (or all
that Peter related) though he did not (record) in order that which
was said or done by Christ.'In other words, even as Renan admits,
the Gospel of Mark must be taken as authentically his.Now Matthew's
Gospel depends for most of its data upon Mark and the Collection of
sayings.Mark's Gospel does not mention the virgin birth; the
Collection probably did.Also, Matthew probably did not write the
Gospel attributed to him; but he almost certainly did write the
Collection of sayings, from which in part the present Gospel according
to Matthew was compiled.Luke's Gospel was undoubtedly written by the
physician Luke, Paul's companion, and depended largely for its data
upon Mark's Gospel and the Collection of Matthew.Yet we can not say
that the omission of mention in the Gospels according to Mark and John
of the virgin birth renders the story a legend, in view of our own
present great knowledge of the constitution of matter, of material
laws, and of the fact that the virgin birth is at least rendered
credible by the subsequent very extraordinary career of Jesus.Moreover, remember that our New Testament is a small book, and that it
is quite probable that a great mass of literature existed on the
subject of Jesus and his work, and that it is possible that other of
the disciples wrote treatises, perhaps many of them.How many of these
touched on the subject of the virgin birth we may never know.But this conclusion at least we must accept: the
validity of the story of the virgin birth does _not_ rest with the
four Gospels which have come down to us out of the great mass of
literature which probably once existed.Rather is the probability of
the immaculate conception a function of our present knowledge of
matter, its pseudo-laws, and the great fact that the entire life of
Jesus as reported in all the Gospels lends weight to the belief that
his birth was not in the ordinary mortal-mind manner.""And I," said Carmen, "can not see that the origin of the human
channel through which the Christ-principle flowed to mankind is of any
consequence.Jesus said that it
existed before Abraham."It has been said that the
immaculate conception was the result of Mary's realization that real
man is the son of God.Certainly Jesus
did seem to manifest some such metaphysical idea.Perhaps Mary was a
woman of tremendous force of character.Perhaps it did come to her
that her son should be the Messiah of his race.Jesus certainly did
acquire the messianic consciousness--and thereby upheaved the world.But, whatever the human mode of birth, certainly the Christ-principle
was brought into the world because of the world's tremendous need.It is only the confusing of the Christ with the
man Jesus that is so largely responsible for the weakness of orthodox
theology."But now, referring again to the Bible, let me say that the Pentateuch
is composed of a variety of documents written by various authors.We
have no positive proof that Moses had aught to do with its authorship,
although parts of it may be based on data which either he originated
or sanctioned.The books of Samuel exhibit a plurality of sources.The
book of Isaiah was written to record the sayings of at least two
persons, both men of marvelous spiritual vision.The Song of Solomon
was originally probably a Persian love-poem.The book of Job
illustrates the human-mind problem of suffering, and the utter
inadequacy of philosophy to heal it.It is a ringing protest against
conventional theology."But it is with the New Testament that we are particularly concerned,
for we believe it to contain the method of salvation from human ills.None of the original documents are extant, of course.And yet, the
most searching textual criticism goes to show that the New Testament
books as we have them to-day are genuine reproductions of the original
documents, with but very little adulteration of erroneous addition by
later hands.I have already spoken of the first
three Gospels.The book of Acts certainly was written by the author of
the third Gospel, Luke.First Peter was composed by the disciple
Peter, or was written under his sanction.The Gospel of John and the
book of First John were written by one and the same author--but
whether by the disciple John or not, I can not say.If this great
disciple did not write the Fourth Gospel, at least his influence seems
to be felt all through it.The probability is that he knew what was in
it, and approved of it, although the actual composition may have been
by another, possibly a very learned Greek.To me, the Fourth Gospel is
the most masterly work ever composed by man.The criticism that John, being a Jew, could not have composed
it, falls before the greater truth that, having become a Christian, he
was no longer a Jew.For how could he have been
other, seeing that he had lived with Jesus?"And now as to Paul, who contributes about one-third of the New
Testament.I have mentioned the letters to the Thessalonians,
Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans as indisputably his.To these we
can add, with scarcely less weight of authenticity, Colossians,
Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians.As to the Epistles to Timothy
and Titus, there is still doubt.These letters were written to the
various Churches chronologically, as I have mentioned them.It has
been said that Jesus was way over the heads of his reporters.But--and
here is the important fact for us--Paul's letters exhibit a
marvelous spiritual growth in the man, and show him at last to be the
grand master-metaphysician of the Christian era.Has it ever
occurred to you that what the Gospels tell about is almost wholly
spiritual?The material is all but neglected by their composers.Indeed, with the questions of time and place, the Gospel narrators
seemed to have been but slightly concerned.But with the delineation
of the Christ--ah!In the light of
this great truth the apparent lack of harmony in the Gospel
narratives loses significance.And how little there is in the
Gospels of theology, of institution, of organization!How trifling are
creed and doctrine, how little are Catholicism and Protestantism,
compared with the stupendous fact that God is, and that His truth,
the Christ-principle, is still here to-day and available!"And so with Paul, he was expounding the'method and secret' of the
Christ.And he first had to work up to it himself.He may have
thought, when he wrote his first letter to the Thessalonians, that the
man Jesus would come again in the skies, with great pomp and
surrounded by the Saints.But in his second letter he states plainly
that the Christ will come when the 'old man' is laid off.Not much
occasion for misunderstanding there, I think.Indeed, after Jesus so
clearly stated that the kingdom of heaven was within men, the marvel
is that there could have arisen any confusion whatsoever on the
subject of the second coming of the Christ.""I believe," interposed Reverend Moore, "that the Epistle to the
Hebrews contains statements of belief in a judgment after death, in a
heaven, a hell, and everlasting life, not wholly consistent with your
remarks.""The Epistle to the Hebrews," returned Father Waite, "was not written
by Paul, nor is it quite consistent with his letters.But, read Paul's
wonderful eighth chapter of Romans.Read his third chapter of First
Corinthians.Read all his letters in the order in which I have
mentioned them, which was as they were written, and you can not fail
to grasp his marvelous expanding perception of the Christ-principle;
the nothingness of the material concept; the impotence of the lie that
opposes God, and constitutes all evil; and the necessity of
right-thinking if one would work out his salvation from the errors
that assail mankind.Paul shows that he passed through a 'belief
period,' and that he emerged into the light of demonstrable
understanding at last.If men had followed him they never could have
fallen into the absurd theological beliefs of foreordination, infant
damnation, the resurrection of the flesh, and all the other
theological horrors and atrocities of the centuries."Yes, the Bible is, as Arnold said, based on propositions which all
can verify.The trouble is, _mankind have not tried to verify them_!They have relegated all that to the life beyond the grave.I fear a
sorry disappointment awaits them, for, even as Paul says, they will be
after the change called death only what they were before.It is like
recovering from a case of sickness, for sickness and death are alike
manifestations of mortal thought.We awake from each still human,
still with our problems before us.We must break the mesmerism of the
belief that the practical application of Jesus' teachings must be
relegated to the realm of death, or to the unattainable.We must apply
the Christ-principle, and learn to hit the mark, for sin is always
weakness, never strength."And remember this: having acquired a knowledge of the Christ, we are
bidden to acknowledge him--that is, to _act-our-knowledge_.Many of
the world's philosophers have worked out great truths.But they have
rested content with that.Many scientists, knowing that matter is
unreal, nevertheless conduct themselves _as if it constituted the one
and only real fact of existence_!Then its
opposite _can not_ be real.The human mentality holds the belief that
there is something apart from God, spirit.That belief becomes
objectified in the human mentality as matter.And within matter is
contained all evil of every sort and name.Evil is not, as the
philosophers would have us believe, a lower form of good.It is not
'good in the making.'It is always error, the direct opposite of
truth.And if truth is real and eternal, error can not be.See the
grave mistake in which Emerson became enmeshed.He said: 'There seems
to be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms.'Now
follow that out to its logical conclusion.If spirit is synonymous
with God, then God manifests Himself in both good and evil, fair and
foul, life and death--and which is good, and which bad?No, my friends, rather accept Jesus' statement
that evil is the lie, of which no man need be afraid, and which all
must and shall overcome.And the 'old man,' with all his material
concepts of nature and the universe, must and will be laid off, thus
revealing the spiritual man, the image and likeness of the one divine
Mind."Now, just a few words about miracles, the great stumbling block to
the acceptance of the Gospels.Are they, together with the entire
Gospel narrative, legendary?If so, they must have arisen during
those fifty years between Jesus and the recording of the narratives.But this very period is covered by Paul's letters, which record his
thought.And even the most relentless of Bible critics admit the
genuineness of Paul's authorship of the Epistles to the Romans,
the Corinthians, the Thessalonians, and the Galatians.If the
Gospel narratives are legends, they grew up and found acceptance in
fifty years.A pretty fair miracle in itself, when we take into
consideration the inherent incredulity of the human mind!As Dean
Farrar says: 'Who would have _invented_, who would have merely
_imagined_, things so unlike the thoughts of man as these?'"Now Paul must have been acquainted with men who had seen and known
Jesus.And we are forced to admit that Paul was a very strong, sane
man.These legends could not have grown up in his day and been
accepted by him.And as long as there were men living who had known
Jesus--and that must have been as late as the last quarter of the
first century--the true events of Jesus' life could hardly have given
way to a set of childish legends.As a matter of recorded fact, the
various Christian Churches had accepted Jesus within thirty years of
the crucifixion.And, too, the words of Paul and the Synoptists were
written at a time when the sick were still being healed and even the
dead raised by the practical application of Jesus' teachings.Hence,
miracles did not astonish them."Our own inability to perform the works attributed to Jesus is hardly
sufficient ground for denying the belief that he really did them.Certainly that the greater portion of the New
Testament was written by a few fishermen, a publican, and a tentmaker
is one of the most stupendous miracles on record!And the miracle of
miracles is Jesus Christ himself!Because Jesus is reported to have
healed the sick, raised the dead, and walked the waves, all in
opposition to material laws--the so-called laws of nature--the world
says the reports are fantastic, that they are fables, and that his
reporters were hypnotized, deluded!And yet I tell you that he did not
break a single law!He did act in defiance of the so-called testimony
of the physical senses, which has always been accepted by mankind as
law.We now know what that sense-testimony is--human, mortal thought.And because he did so,
he instantaneously healed the sick.A miracle expresses, not the
beliefs of the human mind, but the law of God, infinite mind, and
makes that law conceivable to the human mentality.God's laws are
_never_ set aside, for by very definition a law is immutable, else it
ceases to be law.But when the human mind grows out of itself
sufficiently to perceive those laws and to express them to its
fellow-minds, the result is called a miracle.Moreover, the ability to
perform miracles is but a function of spirituality.A miracle is a
sign of one's having advanced to such a degree of spirituality as to
enable him to rise above material consciousness and its limitations,
which are called laws.The consciousness that knows no evil will
perform miracles.These works
were the'signs following,' and attested their knowledge of the
allness of God.Carmen--"

"Lewis!"Carmen _knew_ that no power opposed to God
could hold Sidney.She broke a human-mind, so-called law, a limitation.She
proved God's law of harmony and holiness--wholeness--to be omnipresent
and omnipotent.And, mark me, friends, _every one of us must learn to
do likewise_!Not only must the Church obey Jesus and do the works
which he did, but every individual will have to do them himself.""His works were done for a special reason, Mr.Waite," interposed
Reverend Moore."They were to testify to his messiahship.Father Waite silently regarded the minister for some moments.Then he
went on gently:

"It seems incredible that the plain teachings of Jesus could have
been so warped and twisted as they have been by orthodox theology.Why should even the preachers themselves
condemn the one who seeks to obey Christ?Moore, the real man
is God's highest idea of Himself.The human mind makes mental concepts
of God's man.And Jesus was the grandest concept of God's idea of
Himself that the human mind has ever constructed by means of its
interpretations.One of his grandest
characteristics was his implicit obedience to his vision of the
Father.And he demanded just as implicit obedience from us.But he
bade us, again and again, _heal the sick and raise the dead_!"And Asa had his physicians to whom he turned--with the result
that he'slept with his fathers.'There is no more ironical statement
in the whole Bible than that.We turn to our physicians because we
have no faith in God._Materia medica_ physicians do _not_ heal the
sick.They sometimes succeed in causing the human mind temporarily to
substitute a belief of health for a belief of disease that is all.But Jesus and the early Christians healed by true prayer--the prayer
of affirmation, the prayer that denied reality to evil, and affirmed
the omnipotence of God.And that was done through an understanding of
God as immutable law, or principle."demanded Reverend Moore, with a note
of contempt in his voice."I prefer my own concept of God, as one who
hears our petitions, and pities us, and not as a lifeless principle!"Moore," replied Father Waite, "in that He is
'_that by which all is_.'And in order to be such He must be, as the
Bible says, 'the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.'He must be
immovable, regardless of human pleading and petition.And so true
prayer, the prayer that draws an answer, is not an objective appeal to
Him, but is an intelligent application of the Christ-principle to all
our problems and needs.Such prayer will remove mountains in
proportion to the understanding and motive back of it.And such prayer
does not seek to inform the Almighty of the state of affairs here
among men, informing Him that evil is real and rampant, and begging
that He will stoop down and remove it.It is the prayer that manifests
man's oneness with the infinite mind as its image, reflecting a
knowledge of the allness of good and the consequent unreality and
powerlessness of evil, the lie about it.It was healing by such
prayer, Mr.Moore, that the Episcopal Synod rejected only recently.Instead of doing the healing themselves by means of the principle
given them, they still plead with God, the immovable and immutable, to
do it for them, provided the very uncertain science of _materia
medica_ fails."The true method of prayer was employed by the early Christians, until
the splendid vision of the Christ became obscured and finally lost to
the Church by its bargaining with Constantine for a mess of pottage,
namely, temporal power.Then began to rise that great worldly
institution, the so-called Holy Church.In the first half of the sixth
century Justinian closed the schools of philosophy at Athens.For a
while Judaizing Christianity continued its conflict with Gnosticism.And then both merged themselves into the Catholic form of faith, which
issued forth from Rome, with Christian tradition grafted upon
paganism.Theology and ritualism divided the gospel of healing the
sick and saving the sinner into two radically different systems,
neither of which is Christian, and neither of which can either heal or
save.Since then, lip-service and ceremonial have taken the place of
healing the sick and raising the dead.The world again slipped back
steadily from the spiritual to the material, and to-day ethics
constitutes our religion, and stupid drugs hold sway where once sat
enthroned the healing Christ-principle."Waite, that I have Catholic leanings myself,"
said Doctor Siler."I don't like to hear either my religion or my
profession abused.""My criticism, Doctor," replied Father Waite, "is but an exposure of
the entrenched beliefs and modes of the human mind.""But, sir, the Church is a great social force, and a present
necessity.""The worth of a belief as a social force, Doctor, must be ascertained
from its fruits.The Roman Church has been an age-long instigator of
wars, disorders, and atrocious persecutions throughout the world.Its
assumption that its creed is the only religious truth is an insult to
the world's expanding intelligence.Its arrogant claim to speak with
the authority of God is one of the anomalies of this century of
enlightenment.Its mesmeric influence upon the poor and ignorant is a
continuous tragedy."Are you unmindful of the Church's schools and
hospitals?"Nor am I ignorant of the fact that the success of
Christianity is _not_ measured by hospitals.Rather, their continuance
attests the lamentable failure of its orthodox misinterpretation.I do not want to see this splendid country
forced into the iron shackles of priestcraft."cried Haynerd, pounding the table with his
fist."The time has passed when a man can say, 'My church, be she
right or wrong, but my church!'and insist that it shall be forced
upon us, whether we like it or not!""Doctor," continued Father Waite, "the Romanist has always missed the
mark.He prayed to a God of love to give him power to exterminate
heretics--those who differed with him in belief.But he prayed with
iniquity, hatred, murder in his heart; and God, who is too pure to
know evil, heard him not.Prayer is the affirmation of omnipotent
_good_.Is it good to murder one's fellow-men?The Psalmist wrote: 'If
I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.'That is why
the Church's prayers and curses have failed, and why she herself is a
failing institution to-day.I say this in pity, not in malice.""I, sir, believe in a religion that can hate," returned the doctor."Christianity is as much a religion of hate as of love--hatred of all
that is evil and opposed to the revealed Word of God.""And thereby your religion will fail, and has failed, for God is love.You, by your hatred of what you consider evil, make evil real.Indeed,
the Church has always emphasized evil as a great and living reality.How could it ever hope to overcome it then?Your Church, Doctor, has
little of the meekness of the Christ, and so, little of his strength.Its numbers and great material
wealth do not constitute power.Its assumptions remind me of the
ancient Jews, who declared that God spent much of His time reading
their Talmud.You will have to lay aside, Doctor, all of it, and turn
to the simple, demonstrable teachings of Jesus.When you have learned
to do the works he did, then will you have justified yourself and your
faith."While Father Waite was speaking, Carmen had quietly risen and taken
her place at the piano.When he concluded, she began to play and sing
softly.As the sweet melody flowed out through the room the little
group became silent and thoughtful.Again it was that same weird
lament which the girl had sung long before in the Elwin school to
voice the emotions which surged up in her during her loneliness in the
great city.In it her auditors heard again that night the echoing
sighs of the passive Indians, enslaved by the Christian Spaniards.Hitt's head sank upon his breast as he listened.Haynerd tried to
speak, but choked.The Beaubien buried her face in her hands and wept
softly.The lines about Doctor Siler's mouth relaxed, and his lips
trembled.He rose quietly and went around to where Father Waite sat."My friend--" He bent and took Father Waite's hand.Father Waite sprang to his feet and threw an arm about the doctor."We
are more than that, Doctor," he whispered.And in
reality we are both, here and now, beloved children of God."Then he nodded to the others, and took his
departure.As he passed the piano Carmen rose and seized his hand."You know, Doctor, that we love you, don't you?""Your love," he murmured, as he bent over her hand, "is from the
Christ.Nay, it _is_ the Christ himself among us!"He would have said more, but his voice broke.When Hitt, Reverend Moore, and Doctor Morton had left, Haynerd, who
had remained for a moment to speak to Father Waite, turned to the
Beaubien."Madam," he said, "Mr.But--" He stopped and looked at Carmen."Well,
if I mistake not, his quietness this evening indicated his belief that
this might be our last meeting for some time."Then, abruptly:

"Telephone me, Carmen, if anything of interest comes up to-morrow in
Avon."The Beaubien turned quickly to the girl."You are going to Avon
to-morrow?There was a look of fear in her
eyes.Carmen drew the woman to her, then stooped and kissed her cheek."Mother dearest, I go to Avon with my God."CHAPTER 11


The town of Avon, two hours from New York, lay along Avon creek, from
which its first manufacturing industries derived their motive power.Years before, when it was little more than a barren stretch of sand,
some enterprising soul had built a cotton mill there, with only a few
primitive looms.As the years passed, and kindly Congresses reared
about the industry a high protective wall, the business prospered
marvelously.But shortly after the death of the senior Ames the
company became involved, through mismanagement, with the result that,
to protect itself, the house of Ames and Company, the largest
creditor, was obliged to take over its mills.At first, J. Wilton Ames was disposed to sell the assets of the
defunct company, despite the loss to his bank.But then, after a visit
of inspection, and hours of meditation on certain ideas which had
occurred to him, he decided to keep the property.The banging of the
looms, the whirr of the pickers, the sharp little shrieks of the
spinning machines, fascinated him, as he stood before them.They
seemed to typify the ceaseless throbbing of his own great brain.They
seemed, too, to afford another outlet for that mighty flood of
materialistic thought and energy which flowed incessantly through it.And so he set about reorganizing the business.He
familiarized himself with every detail of the cotton market.He was
already well versed in the intricacies of the tariff.And soon the
idle machinery was roaring again.Soon the capacity of the mills was
doubled.And soon, very soon, the great Ames mills at Avon had become
a corporate part of our stupendous mechanical development of the
century just closed.When Carmen stepped from the train that morning she stood for a moment
looking uncertainly about her.Everywhere on one side as far as she
could see were low, ramshackle frame houses; a few brick store
buildings stood far up the main street; and over at her right the
enormous brick mills loomed high above the frozen stream.The dull
roar of the machinery drifted through the cold air to her ears.Up the
track, along which she had just come, some ragged, illy clad children
were picking up bits of coal.She went directly to them, and asked their names."Anton Spivak," answered one of the children dully, when she laid a
hand on his shoulder."Over dere," pointing off to the jungle of decrepit sheds."Me an'
him, we worked in de mills; but dere ain't no work fer us now."Take me to your home," she said firmly."Dere ain't nobody to home," he
replied."De ol' man an' woman works in de mills daytimes.""Come-a home wi' me," spoke up the boy's companion, a bright-faced
little urchin of some ten years who had given his name as Tony Tolesi.Carmen looked at him for a moment.Up the main street of the town they went for a short distance, then
turned and wended their course, through narrow streets and byways,
down toward the mills.In a few minutes they were in the district
where stood the great frame structures built by the Ames company to
house its hands.Block after block of these they passed, massive,
horrible, decrepit things, and at last stopped at a grease-stained,
broken door, which the little fellow pushed open.Carmen followed shivering, close after the boy, while
he trotted along, proud of the responsibility of conducting a visitor
to his home.At the far end of the hall the lad plunged into a narrow
staircase, so narrow that a stout man could not have mounted it.Up
four of these broken flights Carmen toiled after him, and then down a
long, desolate corridor, which sent a chill into the very marrow of
her bones."Dis is where we lives, Missy," announced the little fellow."Miss-a
Marcus, she live in dere," pointing to the door directly opposite.He pushed open the door before which they had halted.A rush of foul
air and odors of cooking swept out.They enveloped the girl and seemed
to hurl her back.A black-haired woman, holding a crying baby in her
arms, rose hastily from an unmade bed at one side of the room.Two
little girls, six or eight years of age, and a boy still younger,
ranged about their mother and stared in wide-eyed wonder."Dis-a lady, she come to visit," announced Carmen's guide abruptly,
pointing a dirty finger at her.The woman's face darkened, and she spoke harshly in a foreign tongue
to the little fellow."She say," the boy interpreted, as a crestfallen look spread over his
face, "she say she don't spik _Inglese_.""But I speak your language," said the girl, going quickly to her and
extending a hand.Then, in that soft tongue which is music celestial
to these Neapolitan strangers upon our inhospitable shores, she added,
"I want to know you; I want to talk to you."A littered, greasy cook stove
stood in one corner.Close to it at either end were wooden couches,
upon which were strewn a few tattered spreads and blankets, stained
and grimy.A broken table, a decrepit chest of drawers, and a few
rickety chairs completed the complement of furniture.The walls were
unadorned, except for a stained chromo of the Virgin, and the plaster
had fallen away in many places.Several of its panes were broken and stuffed with rags and papers.At the sound of her own language the woman's expression changed.A
light came into her dull eyes, and she awkwardly took the proffered
hand.Then, sweeping
the girl's warm attire with a quick glance, "You are rich!I am rich, yes, but not in money."The woman turned to her children and sent the little brood scattering.At another sharp command little Tony set out a soiled, broken chair
for Carmen.But before the girl could take it the woman's voice again
rose sharply."You are--what do
you say?You come with your gay party to look us over and go
away laughing!But reaching out, she gently lifted the heavy
baby from the woman's arms and sat down with it.For a moment she
patted its cheeks and bent tenderly over it.Then she looked up at the
bewildered mother."I have come here," she said softly, "because I love you."She turned dully and sat down
on one of the begrimed beds.Her little ones gathered about her, their
soiled fingers in their mouths, or clutching their tattered gowns, as
they gazed at the beautiful creature who had suddenly come into their
midst."I am not from the mission," replied the girl gently."I have come to
talk, not of heaven, but of earth, and of you, and of Tony," smiling
down into the eager face of the little boy as he stood before her."You can't take
any of my children!The judge took Pietro Corrello's boy last
week--but you can't have mine!"I don't want your children," said Carmen, smiling up at the
frightened, suspicious mother.I want you to help me to
help all of these people here who need us.The mills are running only
half time, aren't they?But we,
you and I, are going to make things better for them, for everybody
here, aren't we?"But first," she went on hastily, to further allay the poor woman's
fears and to check additional protest, "suppose we plan our dinner.Let's see, Tony, what would you like?"He glanced
inquiringly at his mother; but no sign came from her.Then he could no
longer contain himself:

"Spaghetti!"Carmen drew out her purse and turned to the woman."While we are gone, Tony and the children will wash the dishes
and set the table.For a moment the woman looked uncomprehendingly at the girl, then at
her children, and then about the miserable room in which they were
huddled.Amazement and confusion sat upon her heavy features.Then
these gave way to another dark look of suspicion.She opened her
mouth--

But before she could voice her resentment, Carmen rose and threw an
arm about her.Then the girl quickly drew the startled woman to her
and kissed her on the cheek."Come," she whispered, "get your shawl.God's universal language is the language of love.All nations, all
tribes understand it.The flood-gates, long barred, swiftly opened,
and the tired, miserable woman sank sobbing upon the bed.She could
not comprehend what it was that had come so unannounced into her
dreary existence that cold winter morning.People were not wont to
treat her so.Her life had been an endless, meaningless struggle
against misery, want, grinding oppression.People did not put their
arms around her and kiss her thus.They scoffed at her, they abused
her, they fought with her!She hated them, and the world in which she
lived!"I know, I know," whispered Carmen, as she drew the sobbing woman's
head upon her shoulder.She drew back, and a frightened, superstitious look came into her
face."Yes," said Carmen softly, taking the cue, "I am an angel, right from
heaven.Now you are no longer afraid of me, are you?The woman rose mechanically and took up her thin shawl.Carmen gave a
few directions to the gaping children.And as she went out into the
bleak hall with the woman she heard one of them whisper in tones of
awe:

"Tony, she said she--she was--an angel!Get down on your knees
and cross yourself!"*       *       *       *       *

Upward to the blue vault of heaven, like the streaming mists that
rise through the tropic moonlight from the hot _llanos_, goes the
ceaseless cry of humanity.Oh, if the god of the preachers were real,
his heart must have long since broken!Upward it streams, this
soul-piercing cry; up from the sodden, dull-brained toiler at the
crashing loom; up from the wretched outcast woman, selling herself
to low passions to escape the slavery of human exploitation; up from
the muttering, ill-fed wreck, whose life has been cashed into
dividends, whose dry, worthless hulk now totters to the scrap heap;
up from the white-haired, flat-chested mother, whose stunted babes
lie under little mounds with rude, wooden crosses in the dreary
textile burial grounds; up from the weak, the wicked, the ignorant,
the hopeless martyrs of the satanic social system that makes
possible the activities of such human vultures as the colossus
whose great mills now hurled their defiant roar at this girl, this
girl whose life-motif was love.Close about her, at the wretched little table, sat the wondering group
of children, greedily gorging themselves on the only full meal that
they could remember.And with them sat the still bewildered mother,
straining her dark eyes at the girl, and striving to see in her a
human being, a woman like herself.At her right sat the widow Marcus,
who lived just across the hall.Her husband had been crushed to death
in one of the pickers two years before.The company had paid her a
hundred dollars, but had kept back five for alleged legal fees.She
herself had lost an arm in one of these same pickers, long ago,
because the great owner of the mills would not equip his plant with
safety devices.said the mother at length, as a sense of the reality of
life suddenly returned to her.Tony hurriedly swept the contents of his plate into his mouth, and
went for the battered dinner pail."My man goes to work at six-thirty in the morning," she explained to
Carmen, when the little fellow had started to the mills with the pail
unwontedly full."And he does not leave until five-thirty.He was a
weaver, and he earned sometimes ten dollars a week.And so he had to take a job as carder.He earns
about eight dollars a week now."But you can't live on that, with your children!""Yes, we could," replied the woman, "if the work was steady.You see, if I could work steady, and the children too, we could
live.And I am not nearly so worn out as he is.I
have several years left in me yet."The widow Marcus, who spoke the language from an association with
Italian immigrants since childhood, added her comments from time to
time.She was a gray-haired, kindly soul, bearing no enmity toward the
man to whom she had yielded her husband's life and her own."A man's no good in the mills after he's fifty," she said."You see,
Miss, it's all piece-work, and a man has to be most terribly spry and
active.The strain is something awful, day after day, in the noise and
bad air, and having to keep your eyes fixed on your work for ten hours
at a stretch; and he wears out fast.Then he has to take a job where
he can't make so much.And when he's about fifty he's no good for the
mills any more.""Well, if he hasn't any children, he goes to the poor-house.But, if
he has, then they take care of him.""Yes, they've got to, Miss.The little ones must work in the mills,
too.These mills here take them on when they are only twelve, or even
younger.Tony has worked there, and he is only ten.It's against the
law; but Mr.The company paid me some money two years ago, and I
haven't spent all of it yet.I'm pretty
spry with one arm.""But--you do not pay rent for your home?"Ames--the man whose machines killed your
husband and took off your arm--you still pay rent to him, for one
little room?"Why, his company gave me almost a
hundred dollars, you know!I was lucky, for when Lizzie Sidel's man
lost his hand in the cog wheels he went to law to sue the company, and
three years afterward the case was thrown out of court and he had to
pay the costs himself.But he was a picker-boss, and got nine dollars
a week."A little hand stole up along Carmen's arm.She looked down into the
wondering face of the child."I--I just wanted to see, _Signorina_, if
you were real.""I have been wondering that myself, dear," replied the girl, as her
thought dwelt upon what she had been hearing."I must go now, Miss," said the widow Marcus, rising."I promised to
drop in and look after Katie Hoolan's children this afternoon."Then I will go with you," Carmen announced."But I will come back
here," she added, as some little hands seized hers."If not to-day,
then soon--perhaps to-morrow."Marcus, and entered the doorway
which led to the little inner room where dwelt the widow.There were a
dozen such rooms in the building, the latter informed her.This one in
particular had been shunned for many years, for it had a bad
reputation as a breeder of tuberculosis.But the rent was low, and so
the widow had taken it after her man was killed.It contained a broken
stove, a dirty bed, and a couple of unsteady chairs.The walls were damp, and the paper which had once covered them
was molding and rotting off."It won't stay on," the widow explained, as she saw the girl looking
at it.The
creek overflows and runs into the basement.They call this the
'death-room.'"Carmen shuddered when she looked about this fearful human
habitation.Yet, "The only death to be feared," said Paracelsus, "is
unconsciousness of God."Was this impoverished woman, then, any less
truly alive than the rich owner of the mills which had robbed her of
the means of existence?And can a civilization be alive to the Christ
when it breeds these antipodal types?"Ames's
methods are the epitome of hell!But he is ours, and the worthy
offspring of our ghastly, inhuman social system.We alone are to
blame that he debauches courts, that he blinds executives, and that he
buys legislatures!We let him make the laws, and fatten upon the
prey he takes within their limits.Aye, he is the crafty, vicious,
gold-imbruted manifestation of a whole nation's greed!"Nay, more, he
is the externalization of a people's ignorance of God.Carmen's throat filled as she watched the old woman bustling about the
wretched room and making a feeble attempt at order."You see," the widow went on, happy in the possession of an auditor,
"there is no use making apologies for the looks of my room; I couldn't
make it look much better if I tried.We have
to get water from the hydrant down back of the house.It is pumped
there from the creek, and it's a long climb up these stairs when
you've got only one arm to hold the bucket.And I have to bring my
coal up, too.The coal dealer charges extra for bringing it up so
far."Carmen sat down on an empty box and watched her.The woman's lot
seemed to have touched the depths of human wretchedness, and yet there
burned within her soul a something that the oppression of human
avarice could not extinguish."It's the children, Miss, that I think about," she continued."It's
not so bad as when I was a little one and worked in the cloth mills in
England.I was only six when I went into the mills there.I worked
from seven in the morning until after six at night.And the air was so
bad and we got so tired that we children used to fall asleep, and the
boss used to carry a stick to whip us to keep us awake.My parents
died when I was only eight.They worked in the Hollow-ware works, and
died of lead poisoning.People only last four or five years at that
work.""How many children are employed in these mills here?""I want to see them," said the girl, and there was a hitch in her
voice as she spoke."You can go down and watch them come out about six this evening.But now I must hurry to look after the Hoolan
babes."When she again reached the street Carmen turned and looked up at the
hideous structure from which she had emerged; then she drew a long
breath.The foul air of the "death-room" seemed to fill her lungs as
with leaden weights.The dim light that lay over the wretched hovel
hung like a veil before her eyes."Katie lives a block down the street," said the widow, pointing in the
direction.These tenements don't have
fire-escapes, and the one she lived in burned to the ground in an
hour.She lived on the second floor, and got out.It seemed to Carmen as she listened to the woman that the carnal
mind's chamber of horrors was externalized there in the little town of
Avon, existing with the dull consent of a people too ignorant, too
imbruted, too mesmerized by the false values of life to rise and
destroy it.All that cold winter afternoon the girl went from door to door.There
was no thought of fear when she met dull welcomes, scowls, and
menacing glances.In humble homes and wretched hovels; to Magyar,
Pole, Italian alike; to French Canadian, Irish and Portuguese; and to
the angry, the defiant, the sodden, the crushed, she unfolded her
simple banner of love, the boundless love that discriminates not, the
love that sees not things, but the thoughts and intents of the heart
that lie behind them.And dark looks faded, and tears came; withered
hearts opened, and lifeless souls stirred anew.She knew their
languages; and that knowledge unlocked their mental portals to her.She knew their thoughts, and the blight under which they molded; and
that knowledge fell like the sun's bright rays upon them.She knew
God, their God and hers; and that knowledge began, even on that dull,
gray afternoon, to cut into the chains of human rapacity which
enslaved them.At six that evening she stood at the tall iron gate of the mill yard.Little Tony was at her side, clutching her hand.A single electric
lamp across the street threw a flickering, yellow light upon the snow.The great, roaring mills were ablaze with thousands of glittering
eyes.Suddenly their monster sirens shrieked, a blood-curdling yell.Then their huge mouths opened, and a human flood belched forth.They were not the image and likeness
of God, these creatures, despite the doctrinal platitudes of the
Reverend Darius Borwell and the placid Doctor Jurges.They were not
alive, these stooping, shuffling things, despite the fact that the
religiously contented Patterson Moore would argue that God had
breathed the spirit of life into the thing of dust which He created.And these children, drifting past in a great, surging throng!Fathers
and mothers of a generation to come!Carmen knew that many of them,
despite their worn looks, were scarcely more than ten years old.These
were the flesh and blood upon which Ames, the jungle-beast, waxed
gross!Upon their thin life-currents floated the magnificent
_Cossack_!Yes, she was right, evil can _not_ be
really known.There is no principle by which to explain the hideous
things of the human mind.And then she wondered what the Reverend
Darius Borwell did to earn that comfortable salary of ten thousand a
year in his rich New York church."It's quite a sight, ain't it, Miss?"He was a man of medium height,
young, and of Irish descent."It's a great sight," he continued, with a touch of brogue in his
tones.he cried, catching a passing workman's arm."He ain't worked to-day, Father," replied the man, stopping and
touching his cap.The young priest uttered an exclamation of displeasure.Then, as the
workman started away:

"You'll be at the Hall to-night, Fagin?The man addressed nodded and gave an affirmative grunt, then passed on
into the darkness."It's trying to reach a few of 'em I am," remarked the priest.When a man's stomach's empty he hasn't much respect
for morality.And I can't feed the lot of 'em!"Carmen gazed into the kindly blue eyes of the priest and wondered."No--but I am interested in my fellow-beings."I've some rooms, some on Main street,
which I call the Hall, and some down in the--well, the bad district,
which I call the Mission.They're reading rooms, places for men to meet,
and get acquainted, and rest, and talk.The Hall's for the fellows
who work, like this Fagin.The Mission's for the down-and-outs.""But--are your rooms only for--for men of your faith?""Race or
religion don't figure.It's to give help to every man that needs it.""And you are giving your life to help these people?""I want to see your Hall and Mission.Take me to them," she abruptly
demanded.He looked down at little Tony,
and then up at Carmen again."We will leave the boy at his door, and then go to
your Mission and Hall.Now tell me, you are a Roman Catholic priest?""Yes," he said mechanically, following her as she started away."How did you happen to get into this sort of work?""Oh, I've been at it these ten years!"he returned, now recovered from
his surprise, and pleased to talk about his work."I'd had some
experience in New York in the Bowery district.I came to the
conclusion that there were mighty few down-and-outs who couldn't be
set upon their pins again, given half a chance by any one sufficiently
interested.You see, Miss, I believe in my
fellow-men.Oh, it's only
temporary, I know.It ain't going to change the whole social system.But it helps a bit--and I like it."But," he continued more seriously, "there's going to be trouble here.And it's going to be a bad one."I've written him several times of late.But it's not
much I see he's doing, except to go on sucking the blood from these
poor devils down here!"They soon reached the tenement where Tony lived, and Carmen asked the
priest to go up with her."No," he said, "the good woman doesn't like priests.And my labors
don't reach the women anyway, except through the men.It was only by making many promises that Carmen could at last get away
from the little group on the fourth floor.But she slipped a bill into
Tony's hands as she went out, and then hurriedly crossed the hall and
opened the unlocked door of the widow Marcus's room.Carmen pinned a five-dollar bill upon the pillow and hastened
out."Now," said the priest, when the girl had joined him in the street
below, "it ain't right to take you to the Mission--"

"We'll go there first," the girl calmly announced.By the way, there's a telephone in your place?I want to call up
the health officer.I want to report the condition of these
tenements.""It won't do any good, Miss.I've camped on his
heels for months.If he
gets too troublesome to those higher up, why, he gets fired.He isn't here to report on conditions, but to
overlook 'em."You mean to say that nothing can be done in regard to those awful
buildings which Mr.Ames owns and rents to his mill hands?""It's criminal to let such buildings stand.Meanwhile, the priest was
studying his fair companion, and wondering who she might be.At length
he inquired if she had ever been in Avon before."Haven't seen Pillette's house then?He's resident manager of the Ames
mills.We can go a little out of our way and have a look at it."A few minutes later they stood at the iron gate of the manager's
residence, a massive, brown stone dwelling, set in among ancient trees
in an estate of several acres, and surrounded by shrubs and bushes."Does he know all about those tenements
down there?""Ah, that he does; and cares less.And he knows all about the terrible
hot air in his mills, and the flying lint that clogs the lungs of the
babies working there.He sees them leave the place, dripping with
perspiration, and go out into the zero temperature half naked.And
when they go off with pneumonia, well he knows why; and cares less.He
knows that the poor, tired workers in that great prison lose their
senses in the awful noise and roar, and sometimes get bewildered and
fall afoul of belts and cogs, and lose their limbs or lives.And he wouldn't put safety devices
over his machines, because he doesn't care.I've written to him a
dozen times about it.But--

"And then Pillette," he continued; "I've asked him to furnish his
hands with decent drinking water.They work ten and twelve hours in
that inferno, and when they want to drink, why, all they have is a
barrel of warm water, so covered with lint that it has to be pushed
aside in order to get at the water.Why, Pillette don't even give 'em
change rooms!He won't give 'em decent toilet rooms!Seems to me that when a man can give a ball and send
out invitations on cards of solid gold, he can afford to give a
thought to the thousands who have toiled and suffered in order to
enable him to give such a ball, don't you?"The memory came back now
in hot, searing thoughts."Oh, he catches 'em coming and going!""You see,
he manipulates Congress so that a high tariff law is passed,
protecting him from imported goods.Then he runs up the prices of his
output.That hits his mill hands, for they have to pay the higher
prices that the tariff causes.Oh, no, it doesn't result in increased
wages to them.He is
the only one who profits by high tariff on cotton goods.She might not know that Ames periodically appeared
before Congress and begged its protection--nay, threatened, and then
demanded.She might not know that Senator Gossitch ate meekly from the
great man's hand, and speciously represented to his dignified
colleagues that the benefits of high protective duties were for "the
people" of the United States.She might not know how Hood, employed to
evade the laws enacted to hedge and restrain his master, bribed and
bought, schemed and contrived, lobbied, traded, and manipulated, that
his owner might batten on his blood-stained profits, while he kept his
face turned away from the scenes of carnage, and his ears stopped
against the piteous cries of his driven slaves.But she did know how
needless it all was, and how easy, oh!how pitiably easy, it would be
to remedy every such condition, would the master but yield but a
modicum of his colossal, mesmeric selfishness.She did not know, she
could not, that the master, Ames, made a yearly profit from his mills
of more than two hundred per cent.But she did know that, were he less
stupidly greedy, even to the extent of taking but a hundred per cent
profit, he would turn a flood of sunshine into hundreds of sick,
despairing, dying souls."This is the place," she heard the priest say, his voice seeming to
come from a long distance.They were in front of an old,
two-story building, decrepit and forbidding, but well lighted.While
she gazed, the priest opened the door and bade her enter."This down here is the reading room," he explained.Upstairs is my office, and sleeping rooms for men.Also a
stock of old clothes I keep on hand for 'em when I send 'em out to
look for work.I've clothed an average of four men a day during the
past year, and sent 'em out to look for jobs.I board 'em, and keep
'em going until they land something.Sometimes I have to lend 'em
money.No, I never bother about a
man's religion.Carmen climbed the rough steps to the floor above and entered the
small but well-kept office of the priest."Now here," he said, with a touch of pride, "is my card-index.I keep
tab on all who come here.When they get straightened up and go out to
hunt work, I give 'em identification cards.Just as soon as I can get
funds I'm going to put a billiard table back there and fit up a little
chapel, so's the Catholic men who drift in here can attend service.You know, a lot of 'em don't have the nerve to go to a church.Carmen looked at the man in admiration."We haven't either of us asked the other's name," she said."I've been dying to know yours," he
replied."I'm Father Magee, Daniel Magee.Oh, give any name; it doesn't matter,
just so's I'll know how to address you."And I am from South America," said the girl
simply.*       *       *       *       *

An hour later the girl rose from her chair."I shall have to wait and
visit the Hall another time," she said."I must catch the eight-thirty
back to the city.But--"

"I'll never see you go down this tough street to the depot alone!"averred the priest, reaching for his hat.But she gratefully accepted the proffered escort.Two
of Father Magee's assistants had come in meanwhile, and were caring
for the few applicants below."You're right, Miss Carmen," the priest said, as they started for the
train.It eats my heart out to
see the suffering of these poor people!"At eleven o'clock that night Carmen entered the office of the city
editor of the Express."Ned," she said, "I've been with Dante--no,
Danny--in Inferno.I want expense
money--a good lot--so that I can leave to-morrow night."Haynerd's eyes dilated as he stared at the girl.But what did you find down in Avon?""I'll write you a detailed report of my trip to-morrow.I'm going home
now," she replied.CHAPTER 12


It is sometimes said of the man who toils at forge or loom in this
great commonwealth that he is fast forgetting that Washington is
something more significant to him than what is embraced in the
definition of the gazetteers.Not so, however, of that class of the
genus _homo_ individualized in J. Wilton Ames.He leaned not upon such
frail dependence as the _Congressional Record_ for tempered reports of
what goes on behind closed legislative doors; he went behind those
doors himself.He needed not to yield his meekly couched desires to
the law-builders whom his ballot helped select; he himself launched
those legislators, and gave them their steering charts.But, since the
interpretation of laws was to him vastly more important than their
framing, he first applied himself to the selection of judges, and
especially those of the federal courts.With these safely seated and
instructed at home, he gave himself comfortably to the task of holding
his legislators in Washington to the course he chose.Carmen had not spent a day at the Capital before the significance of
this fact to the common citizen swept over her like a tidal wave.If
the people, those upon whom the stability of the nation rests, looked
as carefully after appointments and elections as did Ames, would their
present wrongs continue long to endure?And after she
had spent the day with the Washington correspondent of the Express, a
Mr.Sands, who, with his young wife, had just removed to the Capital,
she knew more with respect to the mesmerism of human inertia and its
baneful effects upon mankind than she had known before.And yet, after that first day of wandering through the hallowed
precincts of a nation's legislative halls, she sat down upon a bench
in the shadow of the Capitol's great dome and asked herself the
questions: "What am I here for, anyway?And
instinct with her, as we have said, was unrestrained dependence upon
her own thought, the thought which entered her mentality only after
she had first prepared the way by the removal of every obstruction,
including self.At the breakfast table the second morning after her arrival in the
city, Mr.Sands handed her a copy of the Express.Among the editorials
was her full report upon conditions as she had found them in Avon,
published without her signature.Following it was the editor's
comment, merciless in its exposition of fact, and ruthless in its
exposure of the cruel greed externalized in the great cotton industry
in that little town.Carmen rose from the table indignant and protesting.Hitt had said he
would be wise in whatever use he made of her findings.But, though
quite devoid of malignity, this account and its added comment were
nothing less than a personal attack upon the master spinner, Ames.And
she had sent another report from Washington last night, one comprising
all she had learned from Mr.She
must get in touch with him at once.So she set out to find a telegraph
office, that she might check the impulsive publisher who was openly
hurling his challenge at the giant Philistine.When the message had gone, the girl dismissed the subject from her
thought, and gave herself up completely to the charm of the glorious
morning and her beautiful environment.For some time she wandered
aimlessly about the city; then bent her steps again toward the
Capitol.At the window of a florist she stopped and looked long and lovingly at
the gorgeous display within.In the midst of the beautiful profusion a
single flower held her attention.It was a great, brilliant red rose,
a kind that she had never seen before."We call it the 'President' rose, Miss," said the salesman in response
to her query.And when she went out with the splendid flower burning on her bosom
like living fire, she was glad that Hitt had not been there to see her
pay two dollars for it.The great Capitol seemed to fascinate her, as she stood before it a
few moments later.The mighty
sentiments and motives which had actuated the framers of the
Constitution seemed to loom before her like monuments of eternal
stone.Had statesmanship degenerated from that day of pure patriotism
into mere corruption?"Why, my dear girl,
the people of your great State are represented in the national Senate
by--whom?By the flies on the panes; by the mice in
the corners; by the god, perhaps, to whom the chaplain offers his
ineffectual prayers; but not by men.No; one of your Senators
represents a great railroad; the other an express company!Those Senators know no such ridiculous creature as 'the people'!"She turned from the Capitol, and for an hour or more strolled in the
brilliant sunlight."An economic disease," she murmured at length.And, like all disease, it is mental.It is a
disease of the human conscience.It comes from the fear of separation
from good.It all reduces to the belief of separation from God--the
belief that upon men's own human efforts depend all the happiness and
satisfaction they can have.Why, I have never known anything but
happiness and abundance!And yet, _I have never made a single effort
to acquire them_!"For the girl saw not the past vicissitudes of her
life except as shadowy mists, which dimmed not the sun of her joy.There was a tramping of horses' feet.It struck her, and brushed her to one side.She strove to hold
herself, but fell.The man and his companion were off their horses instantly, and
assisted the girl to her feet.asked the one who had been riding ahead."I called to
you, but you didn't seem to hear."laughed the girl, recovering her breath, and stooping to
brush the dust from her dress."Well, I'm glad to hear that!Perhaps you had better come in with
us."The girl raised her head and looked into his face with a bright smile.The man's anxious expression slowly changed into one of wonder, and
then of something quite different.The girl's long, thick hair had
been loosened by the fall, and was hanging about her shoulders.Framed
in the deep brown profusion was the fairest face he had ever looked
upon; the most winning smile; the most loving, compassionate glance."You'll have to come in now, and let the maid help you," he said
firmly."And I'll send you home in an auto."New York," replied Carmen, a little confused as she struggled vainly
with her hair."Oh, I'm not going to fuss with it any more!""Yes, I'll go with you, and let the maid do it up.She glanced about her, and then up the avenue toward which the men had
been riding.A flush suddenly spread over her face, and she turned and
looked searchingly at the man."You--you--live--in--there?"she stammered, pointing toward the
distant house."And you are--"

"Yes," he replied, coming to her assistance, but evidently greatly
enjoying her embarrassment, "I am the President."Then her hand stole mechanically to the rose flaming upon her bosom."I--I guess I know why I bought this now," she said softly.Quickly
unpinning it, she extended it to the man."I was bringing it to you,
wasn't I?"The picture was one that would have rejoiced an artist: the simple
girl, with her tumbled hair and wonderful face, standing there in the
glorious sunlight, holding out a single rose to the chief executive of
a great nation.The President bowed low and took the proffered flower.But the one who gives it is far more so."Then he bade his companion take the two horses to the stable, and
motioned to Carmen to accompany him."I was just returning from my morning ride," he began again, "when you
happened--"

"Things _never_ happen," interrupted the girl gently.He looked at her with a little quizzical side glance."Then you didn't
happen to be in the way?""I was obeying the law of cause and
effect.""A desire to see you, I guess.Or, perhaps, the _necessity_ of seeing
you.And because I wanted to see you in the interests of good, why,
evil seemed to try to run over me.""But why should you wish to see me?""Because you are the head of a wonderful nation.Then:

"You came down from New York to talk with me?""I think I came all the way from South America to see you," she said.There is a revolution in progress down there now.Did you
come to see me about that?I can do nothing--"

The girl shook her head."No," she said, "it's to prevent a revolution
here in your own country that I think I have come to see you."They had by now reached the door of the Executive Mansion.Entering,
the President summoned a maid, and turned the big-eyed girl over to
her."Bring her to my office," he directed, "when she is ready."A little later the nameless girl from Simiti again stood before the
President of the United States."I have an important conference at ten," he said, glancing at a clock."But we have a few minutes before that time.Will you--may I ask you
to tell me something about yourself?"he added, looking
apprehensively at her while he set out a chair.The girl drew the chair close to his desk and sat down."I know
nothing about accidents," she said quietly.Then, turning quite from
that topic, she drew the President quickly into her thought and
carried him off with her as on a magic carpet.From time to time he turned and
stared at his strange visitor.At other times he made notes of points
which impressed him.Once he interrupted, when she made reference to
her past life."This priest, Jose de Rincon, might he not have been
imprisoned as a political offender?""I do not know," the girl replied tenderly."My foster-father,
Rosendo, did not mention him in the two letters which I have
received."The President nodded; and the girl went rapidly on.Soon she was deep
in the problem presented by Avon.But at the mention of that town, and of its dominating genius, the
President seemed to become nervous.At length he raised a hand, as if
to end the interview."I fear I can do nothing at present," he said with an air of
helplessness."But," she protested, "you have the public welfare at heart.And can
you not see that public welfare is the welfare of each individual?"Ames well," the President replied, somewhat irrelevantly."He, like all men of great wealth, presents a serious problem,
doubtless.But he himself, likewise, is confronted by problems of very
trying natures.We must give him time to work them out.""It's like getting at the essence of Christianity,"
she said."The world has had nearly two thousand years in which to do
that, but it hasn't made much of a start as yet."But," the President resumed reflectively, "after all, it is the
people who are wholly responsible for the conditions which exist among
them.They have the means of remedying every economic situation, the
ballot.It is really all in their hands, is it not?They elect their
public officers, their judges, and their lawmakers.""You too," she said, "take refuge in the cant
of the age.Yes, the people do try to elect public servants; but by
some strange anomaly the servant becomes master the moment he enters
the door of office.And then
they, and you, sit helplessly back and cry, No use!And if the people
rise, their servants meet them with a hail of lead.It's really
childishly ridiculous, isn't it?when you stop to consider it
seriously."She leaned her elbows upon the desk, and sat with chin in her hands,
looking squarely into the eyes of the President."So you, the head of this great nation, confess to utter helplessness,"
she slowly said.A servant entered at that moment with a card.The President glanced at
it, and bade him request the caller to wait a few moments.Then, after
some reflection:

"The people will always--"

The door through which the servant had passed was abruptly thrown
open, and a harsh voice preceded the entrance of a huge bulk."I am not accustomed to being told to wait, Mr.President," said the
ungracious voice."My appointment was for ten o'clock, and I am here
to keep it."Then the newcomer stopped abruptly, and stared in amazement at the
young girl, sitting with her elbows propped upon the desk, and her
face close to that of the President.His
attention was centered upon the girl who sat looking calmly up at him.A dark, menacing scowl drew his bushy eyebrows together, and made the
sinister look which mantled his face one of ominous import to the
person upon whom it fell.Carmen was the first to break the tense silence.With a bright smile
illuming her face she rose and held out a hand to the giant before
her."We meet pretty often, don't
we?"Ames ignored both the greeting and the extended hand.Turning upon the
President, he said sharply: "So, the Express seeks aid in the White
House, eh?"Ames," said Carmen quickly, answering for the President."It
seeks to aid the White House.""Might I ask," he said in a tone of mordant
sarcasm, "how you learned that I was to be here this morning?I would
like to employ your methods of espionage in my own business.""I would give anything if you _would_ employ my methods in your
business," returned the girl gently.The President looked in embarrassment from one to the other."I think,
Miss Carmen," he said, "that we must consider our interview ended.A peculiar expression had come into Ames's features.President," he said in a tone pregnant with
meaning."I am glad to have a representative of the New York press
with us to hear you express your attitude toward the cotton
schedule."His
indignation mounted, but he checked it."The schedule has been reported out of committee," he replied briefly."I am aware of that," said Ames."And your influence with Congress in
regard to it?""Shall the Avon mills be closed pending a decision?Or, on the
assumption that Congress will uphold the altered schedule, must the
Spinners' Association begin immediate retrenchment?As president of
that Association, I ask for instructions.""My influence with Congress, as you well know, Mr.Ames, is quite
limited," replied the hectored executive."It is not a question of the _amount_ of your influence with that
body, Mr.President," returned Ames coldly, "but of how you will
employ that which you have."Silence lay upon them all for some moments.Then Ames resumed:

"I would remind you," he remarked with cruel insinuation, "that--or,"
glancing at the girl, "perhaps I should not make this public."He
paused and awaited the effect of his significant words upon the
President.Then, as the latter remained silent, he went on evenly:

"Second-term prospects, you are aware, are often very greatly
influenced by public facts regarding the first election.Of course we
are saying nothing that the press might use, but--well, you must
realize that there is some suspicion current as to the exact manner in
which your election was--"

"I think you wish to insinuate that my election was due to the
Catholic vote, which you controlled in New York, and to your very
generous campaign contributions, do you not?I see no reason for
withholding from the press your views on the subject.""But, my friend, this is an age of investigation, and of suspicion
toward all public officials.And such rumors wouldn't look well on the
front pages of the press throughout the country.Of course, our young
friend here isn't going to mention them to her superiors; but,
nevertheless, they ought to be suppressed at once.Their effect upon
your second-term prospects would be simply annihilating.Now I am in a
position to greatly assist in the matter of--well, in fact, I have
already once offered my aid to the Express.And I stand ready now to
join with it in giving the lie to those who are seeking to embarrass
the present administration.Miss Carmen is with us--"

"Mr.Ames," the girl quietly interrupted, "I wish _you_ were with
_us_.""But, my dear girl, have I--"

"For then there would be no more suffering in Avon," she added.Then it was you who wrote that misleading stuff in the Express,
eh?May I ask," he added with a contemptuous
sneer, "by whose authority you have visited the houses occupied by my
tenants, without my permission or knowledge?I take it you were down
there, although the cloudy weather must have quite dimmed your
perception.""Yes," she answered in a low voice, "I have been there.Yes, I visited your charnel houses and your cemeteries.I held their trembling hands, and stroked their
hot brows.I fed them, and gave them the promise that I would plead
their cause with you."But you first come here to--"

"It was with no thought of seeing you that I came to Washington, Mr.If I cross your path often, it must be for a purpose not yet
revealed to either of us.Perhaps it is to warn you, to awaken you, if
not too late, to a sense of your desperate state."You are drunk, you know, drunk with greed.And such continuous
drunkenness has made you sick unto death.It is the same dread disease
of the soul that the wicked Cortez told the bewildered Mexicans he
had, and that could be cured only with gold.Ames, that you are mesmerized by the evil which is always using you."She stood close to the huge man, and looked straight up into his face.He remained for a moment motionless, yielding again to that
fascination which always held him when in her presence, and of which
he could give no account to himself.That slight, girlish figure--how
easily he could crush her!"But you couldn't, you know," she said cryptically, as she shook her
head.He recoiled a step, struck by the sudden revelation that the girl had
read his thought.Ames," she continued, "what a craven error is before
truth.It makes a coward of you, doesn't it?Your boasted power is
only a mesmerism, which you throw like a huge net over your victims.You and they can break it, if you will.""We really must consider our
interview ended."I guess the appointment was made for to-day," the girl said softly."And by a higher power than any of us.Ames is the type of man who
is slowly turning our Republican form of government into a despotism
of wealth.He boasts that his power is already greater than a czar's.You bow before it; and so the awful monster of privilege goes on
unhampered, coiling its slimy tentacles about our national resources,
our public utilities, and natural wealth.I--I can't see how you, the
head of this great nation, can stand trembling by and see him do it.He made as if to reply, but restrained himself.A stern look then came into the
President's face.Then he
turned again to his desk and sat down."Please be seated," he said, "both of you.I don't know what quarrel
there is between you two, and I am not interested in it.But you, Miss
Carmen, represent the press; Mr.The things which have
been voiced here this morning must remain with us alone.Now let us
see if we can not meet on common ground.Is the attitude of your
newspaper, Miss Carmen, one of hostility toward great wealth?""The Express raises its voice only against the folly and wickedness of
the human mind, not against personality," replied the girl.We attack only the human thought which manifests in him.We
oppose the carnal thought which expresses itself in the folly, the
madness of strife for excessive wealth.It is that strife that makes
our hospitals and asylums a disgraceful necessity.It makes the
immigrant hordes of Europe flock here because they are attracted by
the horrible social system which fosters the growth of great fortunes
and makes their acquisition possible.Our alms-houses and prisons
increase in number every year.It is because rich men misuse their
wealth, trample justice under foot, and prostitute a whole nation's
conscience."They do not all--"

"It is a law of human thought," said Carmen in reply, "that mankind in
time become like that which has absorbed their attention.Rich men
obey this law with utmost precision.They acquire the nature and
character of their god, gold.They rapidly grow to be like that which
they blindly worship.They grow
metallic, yellow, calloused, unchanging, and soulless, like the coins
they heap up.There is the great danger to our country, Mr.And it is against the human thought that produces such beings--thought
stamped with the dollar mark--that the Express opposes itself."She hesitated, and looked in the direction of Ames.Then she added:

"Their features in time reveal to the world their metallic thought.Their veins shrivel with the fiery lust of gold.And then, at last, they crumble and sink into the dust of
which their god is made.And still their memories continue to poison
the very sources of our national existence.You see," she concluded,
"there is no fool so mired in his folly as the man who gives his soul
for great wealth.""A very enjoyable little sermon, preached for my benefit, Miss
Carmen," interposed Ames, bowing to her."And now if you have finished
excoriating my poor character," he continued dryly, "will you kindly
state by whose authority you publish to the world my affairs?"The maudlin sentimentalism of such as you make us all suffer!""Hadn't we better sing a hymn
now?You'll be wiser in a few years, I hope."Ames, by what right you own
mines, and forests, and lands?"By the divine right of law, most assuredly," he retorted.I have learned," she
continued, turning to the President, "that a bare handful of men own
or control all the public utilities of this great country.But," abruptly, "you believe in God, don't you?"He nodded his head, although with some embarrassment.His religion
labored heavily under political bias.She looked down at the floor, and sat silent for a while."Divine
right," she began to murmur, "the fetish of the creatures made rich by
our man-made social system!'The heavens are thine, the earth also is
thine: as for the world and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded
them.'But, oh, what must be the concept of God held by the rich, a
God who bestows these gifts upon a few, and with them the privilege
and divine consent to oppress and crush their fellow-men!What a low
order of intelligence the rich possess!An intelligence wherein the
sentiments of love and justice have melted into money!"President," put in Ames at this juncture, "I think we have spent
quite enough time moralizing.Suppose you now indicate your attitude
on the cotton tariff.Her sparkling eyes looked right into the
President's."I admire the man," she said,
"who dares to stand for the right in the face of the great taboo!There are few men nowadays who stand for anything in particular."exclaimed Ames, aware now that he had made a mistake in
permitting the girl to remain, "I wish my interview to be with you
alone, Mr."I have embarrassed you both, haven't I?"But first--"

She went to Ames and laid a hand on his arm."I wish--I wish I might
awaken you," she said gently."There is no victim at Avon in so
desperate a state as you.More gold will not cure you, any more than
more liquor can cure a slave to strong drink.You do not know that you
are hourly practicing the most despicable form of robbery, the
wringing of profits which you do not need out of the dire necessities
of your fellow-beings."She stopped and smiled down into the face of the man.This girl always dissected his soul with a smile on
her face."I wish I might awaken you and your poor victims by showing you and
them that righteousness makes not for a home in the skies, but for
greater happiness and prosperity for everybody right here in this
world.Don't you really want the little babies to have enough to eat
down there at Avon?Do you really want the President to support you in
the matter of the cotton schedule, and so increase the misery and
sorrow at your mills?that one's greatest
happiness is found only in that of others."She stood looking at him
for a few moments, then turned away.The President rose and held out his hand to her.She almost laughed as
she took it, and her eyes shone with the light of her eager, unselfish
desire."I--I guess I'm like Paul," she said, "consumed with zeal.Anyway,
you'll wear my rose, won't you?""And--you are not a bit afraid about a second term, are you?As for
party principle, why, you know, there is only _one_ principle, God.He
is the Christ-principle, you know, and that is way above party
principle."Under the spell of the girl's strange words every emotion fled from
the men but that of amazement."Righteousness, you know, is right-thinking.And that touches just
that about which men are most chary, their pocketbooks."Then she arched her brows and said naively:
"You will find in yesterday's Express something about Avon.You will
not use your influence with Congress until you have read it, will
you?"A deep quiet fell upon the men, upon the great executive and the great
apostle of privilege.It seemed to the one that as the door closed
against that bright presence the spirit of night descended; the other
sat wrapped in the chaos of conflicting emotions in which she always
left him."She's the bastard daughter of a <DW64> priest," replied Ames in an
ugly tone.cried the thoroughly angered Ames, bringing a huge
fist down hard upon the desk.And, what's
more, she's head over heels in love with another renegade priest!"But that's neither here nor there," he continued savagely."I want to
know what you are going to do for us?""I--I do not see, Mr.Ames, that I can do anything," replied the
President meditatively."Well--will you leave the details to us, and do as we tell you then?"the financier pursued, taking another tack."Yes--about the girl, you--"

"Damn the girl!""I've got proofs that will ruin
her, and you too--and, by God, I'll use 'em, if you drive me to it!You seem to forget that you were elected to do our bidding, my
friend!"For a long time he sat
staring at the floor."It was wonderful," he said,
"wonderful the way she faced you, like David before Goliath!There
isn't a vestige of fear in her make-up.I--we'll talk this matter over
some other time, Mr.roared Ames, his self-control flying to the
winds."I can ruin you--make your administration a laughing-stock--and
plunge this country into financial panic!Do you do as I say, or
not?"The President looked the angry man squarely in the eyes."I do not,"
he answered quietly.CHAPTER 13


"It's corking!cried Haynerd, when he and Hitt had
finished reading Carmen's report on her first few days in Washington."Makes a fellow feel as if the best thing Congress could do would be
to adjourn for about fifty years, eh?But
she's a wonder, Hitt!And she's booming the Express to the skies!That's why she is so--as the
Mexicans say--_simpatico_.""Well, not with you, I hope!""No, unfortunately," replied Haynerd, assuming a dejected mien, "but
with that Rincon fellow--and he a priest!He's got a son down in
Cartagena somewhere, and he doesn't write to her either.She's told
Sid the whole story, and he's working it up into a book during his odd
moments.But, say," turning the conversation again into its original
channel, "how much of her report are we going to run?You know, she
tried to head us off.As if she
hadn't already attacked him and strewn him all over the field!""We'll have to be careful in our allusions to the President," replied
Hitt."I'll rewrite it myself, so as not to offend her or him.her reports are the truth, and they rightfully
belong to the people!The Express is the avowed servant of the
public!I see no reason for
concealing a thing.Did I tell you that I had two inquiries from
Italian and German papers, asking permission to translate her reports
into their own columns?"Did you wire her to see
Gossitch and Mall?""Yes, and Logue, as well as others.And I've put dozens of senators
and congressmen on our mailing list, including the President himself.I've prepared letters for each one of them, calling attention to the
girl and her unique reports.She certainly writes in a fascinating
vein, doesn't she?Meanwhile, she's circulating around down there and
advertising us in the best possible manner.he finished, slapping the city editor roundly upon the back."Confine your enthusiasm to words, my
friend.Say, what did you do about that liquid food advertisement?""Discovered that it was beer," replied Hitt, "and turned it firmly
down."Not that we care to advertise it, but--"

Hitt laughed."When that fellow Claus smoothly tried to convince me
that beer was a food, I sent a sample of his stuff to the Iles
chemical laboratory for analysis.They reported ninety-four per cent
water, four per cent alcohol--defined now as a poisonous drug--and
about two per cent of possible food substance.If the beer had been of
the first grade there wouldn't have been even the two per cent of
solids.You know, I couldn't help thinking of what Carmen said about
the beer that is advertised in brown bottles to preserve it from the
deleterious effects of light.Light, you know, starts decay in beer.Well, light, according to Fuller, is 'God's eldest daughter.'Emerson
says it is the first of painters, and that there is nothing so foul
that intense light will not make it beautiful.Thus the light of truth destroys the fermentation which
is supposed to constitute the human mind and body.So light tries to
purify beer by breaking it up.The brewers have to put it into brown
bottles to preserve its poisonous qualities.As Carmen says, beer
simply can't stand the light.It's astonishing that so many so-called reputable papers will
take their advertising stuff.It's just as bad as patent medicine
ads."And I note that the American public still spend their annual
hundred million dollars for patent medicine dope.Most of this is
spent by women, who are largely caught by the mail-order trade.I
learned of one exposure recently made where it was found that a widely
advertised eye wash was composed of borax and water.The cost was
somewhere about five cents a gallon, and it sold for a dollar an
ounce.Nice little profit of some two hundred and fifty thousand per
cent, and all done by the mesmerism of suggestive advertising.Speaking of parasites on
society, Ames is not the only one!""And yet those fellows howl and threaten us with the boycott because
we won't advertise their lies and delusions.It's as bad as
ecclesiastical intolerance!"Then she returned to New York and
went directly to Avon.What she did there can only be surmised by a
study of her reports to Hitt, who carefully edited them and ran them
in the Express.Again, after several days, she journeyed back to
Washington.Her enthusiasm was boundless; her energy exhaustless; her
industry ceaseless; and her persistency doggedly unshakable.In
Washington she made her way unhindered among those whom she deemed
essential to the work which she was doing.Doubtless her ability to do
this and to gain an audience with whomsoever she might choose was in
great part due to her beauty and charming simplicity, her grace of
manner, and her wonderful and fearless innocence, combined with a
mentality remarkable for its matured powers.Hitt and Haynerd groaned
over her expenses, but promptly met them."She's worth it," growled the latter one day."She's had four
different talks with the President!How on earth do you suppose she
does it?And how did she get Mall and Logue to take her to dinner and
to the theater again and again?And what did she do to induce that
doddering old blunderbuss, Gossitch, to tell her what Ames was up to?How do you suppose she found out that
Ames was hand in glove with the medical profession, and working tooth
and nail to help them secure a National Bureau of Health?Say, do you
know what that would do?It would foist allopathy upon every chick and
child of us!Have
we come to that in this supposedly free country?By the way, Hitt,
Doctor Morton has been let out of the University.He says Ames
did it because of his association with us."I think, my friend," replied Hitt, "that it is a very serious matter,
and one that impinges heavily upon the rights of every one of us, when
a roaring lion like Ames is permitted to run loose through our
streets."I've centered my hopes in Carmen," sighed Haynerd.If she can't stop him, then God himself can't!"A few moments later he came out
again and handed an opened letter to Haynerd."Some notes she's sent
from Washington.Mentions the National Bureau of Health project.It
hasn't escaped her, you see.Say, will you tell me where she picks up
her information?""The Lord gives it to her, I guess," said Haynerd, glancing over the
letter."'Reverend Borwell and Doctor Siler are down here lobbying for the
  National Bureau of Health bill.Also, Senator Gossitch dropped a
  remark to me yesterday which makes me believe that he and other
  Senators have been approached by Tetham with reference to sending
  an American ambassador to the Vatican.Haynerd handed the letter back to Hitt and plunged into the papers on
his desk."This
country's going stark, staring mad!We're crazy, every mother's son of
us!""It's the human mind that is crazy, Ned, because it is wholly without
any basis of principle," returned Hitt with a sigh.*       *       *       *       *

"Doctor Siler!exclaimed that worthy person, looking up from
the gutter, whither he had hastened after his silk hat which had been
knocked off by the encounter with the young girl who had rounded the
corner of Ninth street into Pennsylvania avenue and plunged full into
him."Oh, I'm so sorry, Doctor!I was coming from the Smithsonian
Institution, and I guess--"

"Don't mention it, Miss Carmen.It's a privilege to have my hat
knocked off by such a radiant creature as you."And I want to offer
my--"

"Look here, Miss Carmen, just offer yourself as my guest at luncheon,
will you?That will not only make amends, but place me hopelessly in
your debt.""I was on my way to a
restaurant."I've got a little place around the corner here
that would have made Epicurus sit up nights inditing odes to it."The girl laughed merrily, and slipped her arm through his.A few
minutes later they were seated at a little table in a secluded corner
of the doctor's favorite chophouse."By the way, I met a friend of yours a few minutes ago," announced the
doctor, after they had given their orders."He was coming out of the
White House, and--were you ever in a miniature cyclone?That's twice to-day I've been sent to the gutter!"He laughed heartily
over his experiences, then added significantly: "You and he are both
mental cyclones, but producing diametrically opposite effects."The doctor went on chatting
volubly."Ames and the President don't seem to be pulling together
as well as usual.The President has come out squarely against him
now in the matter of the cotton schedule.Ames declares that the
result will be a general financial panic this fall.Sands, the Express correspondent, seems to be getting mighty close
to administration affairs these days.Where did he get that data
regarding a prospective National Bureau of Health, do you suppose?""I gave it to him," was the simple reply.The doctor dropped his fork, and stared at the girl."Well--of course you naturally would be opposed to it.But--"

"Tell me," she interrupted, "tell me candidly just what you doctors
are striving for, anyway.Are your activities
all quite utilitarian, or--is it money and monopoly that you are
after?It makes a lot of difference, you know, in one's attitude
toward you.If you really seek the betterment of health, then you are
only honestly mistaken in your zeal.But if you are doing this to make
money--and I think you are--then you are a lot of rascals, deserving
defeat.""Miss Carmen, do you impugn my motives?"He began to color slightly under her keen
scrutiny."Well," she finally continued, "let's see.If you doctors
have made the curative arts effective, and if you really do heal
disease, then I must support you, of course.But, while there is
nothing quite so important to the average mortal as his health, yet I
know that there is hardly anything that has been dealt with in such a
bungling way.The art of healing as employed by our various schools of
medicine to-day is the result of ages and ages of experimentation and
bitter experience, isn't it?And its cost in human lives is simply
incalculable.No science is so speculative, none so hypothetical, as
the so-called science of medicine.""But we have had to learn," protested the doctor."Do you realize, Doctor," she resumed, "that the teaching and
preaching of disease for money is one of the greatest curses resting
upon the world to-day?I never saw a doctor until I was on the boat
coming to New York.And then I thought he was one of the greatest
curiosities I had ever seen.I followed him about and listened to him
talk to the passengers.And I learned that, like most of our young
men, he had entered the practice of medicine under the pressure of
dollars rather than altruism.Money is still the determining factor in
the choice of a profession by our young men.And success and fortune
in the medical profession, more than in any other, depend upon the
credulity of the ignorant and helpless human mind.""Do you deny that great progress has been made in the curative arts?""See what we have done with diphtheria, with typhoid,
with smallpox, and malaria!""Surely, Doctor, you can not believe that the mere temporary removing
of a disease is _real_ healing!You render one lot of microbes
innocuous, after thousands of years of experimentation, and leave
mankind subject to the rest.Do
you expect to go on that way, making set after set of microbes
harmless to the human body, and thus in time, after millions of years,
eradicate disease entirely?Do you think that people will then cease
to die?All the time you are working only in matter and through
material modes.Do you expect thereby to render the human sense of
life immortal?Your patients
get well, only to fall sick again.And death to you is still as
inevitable as ever, despite your boasted successes, is it not so?"He broke into a bantering laugh, but did not reply."Doctor, the human mind is self-inoculated.It will keep on
making them, until it is educated out of itself, and taught to do
better.Then it will give place to the real reflection of divine mind;
and human beings will be no more.Why don't you realize this, you
doctors, and get started on the right track?Your real work is in the
_mental_ realm."Well, I for one have little respect for faith cure--"

"Nor I," she interposed."Dependence upon material drugs, Doctor, is
reliance upon the _phenomena_ of the human mind.Faith cure is
dependence upon the human mind itself, upon the _noumenon_, instead of
the _phenomenon_.Hypnotism is mental
suggestion, the suggestions being human and material, not divine
truth.The drugging system is an outgrowth of the belief of life in
matter.Faith cure is the belief of life and power inherent in the
human mind.The origin of healing is
shrouded in mythology, and every step of its so-called progress has
been marked by superstition, dense ignorance, and fear.The first
doctor that history records was the Shaman, or medicine-man, whose
remedies reflected his mental status, and later found apt illustration
in the brew concocted by Macbeth's witches.And think you he has
disappeared?Unbelievable as it may seem, it was only a short time ago
that a case was reported from New York where the skin of a freshly
killed black cat was applied as a remedy for an ailment that had
refused to yield to the prescribed drugging!And only a few years ago
some one applied to the Liverpool museum for permission to touch a
sick child's head with one of the prehistoric stone axes there
exhibited.""That was mere superstition," retorted the doctor."But _materia medica_ is superstition incarnate.And because of the superstition that life and virtue and power are
resident in matter, mankind have swallowed nearly everything known to
material sense, in the hope that it would cure them of their own
auto-infection.You remember what awful recipes Luther gave for
disease, and his exclamation of gratitude: 'How great is the mercy of
God who has put such healing virtue in all manner of muck!'""Miss Carmen," resumed the doctor, "we physicians are workers, not
theorists.We handle conditions as we find them, not as they ought to
be.""You handle conditions as the
human, mortal mind believes them to be, that's all.You accept its
ugly pictures as real, and then you try desperately through
legislation to make us all accept them.Yet you would bitterly resent
it if some religious body should try to legislate its beliefs upon
you."Now listen, you doctors are rank materialists.Perhaps it is because,
as Hawthorne puts it, in your researches into the human frame your
higher and more subtle faculties are materialized, and you lose the
spiritual view of existence.Your only remedy for diseased matter is
more matter.Why, ignorance and
superstition have given rise to by far the larger number of remedies
in use by you to-day!And all of your attempts to rationalize medicine
and place it upon a systematic basis have signally failed, because the
only curative property a drug has is the credulity of the person who
swallows it.And that is a factor which varies with the individual.""The most advanced physicians give little medicine nowadays, Miss
Carmen.""They are beginning to get away from it, little by little," she
replied."In recent years it has begun to dawn upon doctors and
patients alike that the sick who recover do so, not because of the
drugs which they have taken, but _in spite of them_!One of the most
prominent of our contemporary physicians who are getting away from the
use of drugs has said that eighty-five per cent of all illnesses get
well of their own accord, no matter what may or may not be done for
them.In a very remarkable article from this same doctor's pen, in
which he speaks of the huge undertaking which physicians must assume
in order to clear away the _materia medica_ rubbish of the ages, he
states that the greatest struggle which the coming doctor has on his
hands is with drugs, and the deadly grip which they have on the
confidence and affections both of the profession and of the public.Among his illuminating remarks about the drug system, I found two
drastic statements, which should serve to lift the veil from the eyes
of the chronic drug taker.These are, first, 'Take away opium and
alcohol, and the backbone of the patent medicine business would be
broken inside of forty-eight hours,' and, second, 'No drug, save
quinine and mercury in special cases, will cure a disease.'In words
which he quotes from another prominent physician, 'He is the best
doctor who knows the worthlessness of most drugs.'"The hundreds of drugs listed in books on _materia medica_ I find are
gradually being reduced in number to a possible forty or fifty, and
one doctor makes the radical statement that they can be cut down to
the'six or seven real drugs.'Still further light has been thrown
upon the debasing nature of the drugging system by a member of the
Philadelphia Drug Exchange, in a recent hearing before the House
Committee on municipal affairs right here.He is reported as saying
that it makes little difference what a manufacturer puts into a patent
medicine, for, after all, the effect of the medicine depends upon the
faith of the user.The sick man who turns to patent medicines for
relief becomes the victim of 'bottled faith.'If his faith is
sufficiently great, a cure may be effected--and the treatment has been
_wholly mental_!The question of ethics does not concern either the
patent medicine manufacturer or the druggist, for they argue that if
the sick man's faith has been aroused to the point of producing a
cure, the formula of the medicine itself is of no consequence, and,
therefore, if a solution of sugar and water sold as a cure for colds
can stimulate the sufferer's faith to the point of meeting his need,
the business is quite legitimate.'A bunch of bottles and sentiment,'
adds this member of the Drug Exchange, 'are the real essentials for
working healing miracles.'"exclaimed the doctor, again sitting back and regarding her with
amazement."But, Doctor, I am intensely interested in my fellow-men.I want to
help them, and show them how to learn to live.""And I am doing all I can, the very best I
know how to do.""I guess you mean you are doing what you are prompted to do by every
vagrant impulse that happens to stray into your mentality, aren't
you?""You haven't really seriously thought out your
way, else you would not be here now urging Congress to spread a
blanket of ignorance over the human mind.If you will reflect
seriously, if you will lay aside monetary considerations, and a little
of the hoary prejudice of the ages, and will carefully investigate our
present medical systems, you will find a large number of schools of
medicine, bitterly antagonistic to one another, and each accusing the
other of inferiority as an exact science, and as grossly ignorant and
reprehensibly careless of life.But which of these warring schools can
show the greatest number of cures is a bit of data that has never been
ascertained.A recent writer says: 'As important as we all realize
health to be, the public is receiving treatment that is anything but
scientific, and the amount of unnecessary suffering that is going on
in the world is certainly enough to make a rock shed tears.'He
further says that, 'at least seventy-five per cent of the people we
meet who are apparently well, are suffering from some chronic ailment
that regular medical systems can not cure,' and that many of these
would try further experimentation were it not for the criticism that
is going on in the medical world regarding various curative systems.The only hope under the drugging system is that the patient's life and
purse may hold out under the strain of trying everything until he can
light upon the right thing before he reaches the end of the list.""And do you include surgery in your general criticism?""Surgery is no less an outgrowth of the belief of sentient matter than
is the drugging system," she replied."It is admittedly necessary in
the present stage of the world's thought; but it is likewise admitted
to be 'the very uncertain art of performing operations,' at least
ninety per cent of which are wholly unnecessary."You see," she went on, "the effect upon the _moral_ nature of the
sick man is never considered as rightfully having any influence upon
the choice of the system to be employed.If Beelzebub can cast out
demons, why not employ him?For, after all, the end to be attained is
the ejection of the demon.And if God had not intended minerals and
plants to be used as both food and medicine, why did He make them?Besides, man must earn his bread in some way under our present crude
and inhuman social system, and if the demand for drugs exists we may
be very sure it will be supplied by others, if not by ourselves.Again, the influence of commercialism as a determining factor in the
choice of a profession, is an influence that works to keep many in the
practice of a profession that they know to be both unscientific and
harmful.The result is an inevitable lowering of ideals to the lust of
material accumulation.""You certainly are hard on us poor doctors!And
we have done so much for you, too, despite your accusations.Think of
the babies that are now saved from diphtheria alone!""And think of the children who are the victims of the medical mania!""Think how they are brought up under the tyranny of
fear!Fear of this and of that; fear that if they scratch a finger
blood poisoning will deprive them of life; fear that eating a bit of
this will cause death; or sitting in a breeze will result in wasting
sickness!As for diphtheria antitoxin, it is in the
same class as the white of an egg.It is the
result of human belief, the belief that a horse that has recovered
from diphtheria can never again be poisoned by the microbe of that
disease.The microbe, Doctor, is the externalization in the human
mentality of the mortal beliefs of fear, of life and power in matter,
and of disease and death.The microbe will be subject, therefore, to
the human mind's changing thought regarding it, always.""Well then," said the doctor, "if people are spiritual, and if they
really are a consciousness, as you say, why do we seem to be carrying
about a body with us all the time--a body from which we are utterly
unable to get away?""It is because the mortal mind and body are one, Doctor.The body is
a lower stratum of the human mind.Hence, the so-called mind is
never distinct from its body to the extent of complete separation,
but always has its substratum with it.And, Doctor, the mind can not
hold a single thought without that thought tending to become
externalized--as Professor James tells us--and the externalization
generally has to do with the body, for the mind has come to center
all its hopes of happiness and pleasure in the body, and to base its
sense of life upon it.The body, being a mental concept formed of
false thought, passes away, from sheer lack of a definite principle
upon which to rest.Therefore the sense of life embodied in it passes
away with it.You know, the ancients had some idea of the cause of
disease when they attributed it to demons, for demons at least are
mental influences.But then, after that, men began to believe that
disease was sent by God, either to punish them for their evil deeds,
or to discipline and train them for paradise.Think
of regarding pain and suffering as divine agents!I don't wonder
people die, do you?Humboldt, you know, said: 'The time will come
when it will be considered a disgrace for a man to be sick, when the
world will look upon it as a misdemeanor, the result of some
vicious thinking.'Many people seem to think that thought affects
only the brain; but the fact is that _we think all over_!""But look here," put in the doctor."Here's a question I intended to
ask Hitt the other night.He said the five physical senses did not
testify truly.Well now, if, as you say, the eyes do not testify to
disease, then they can't testify to cures either, eh?"He sat back
with an air of triumph."The physical senses testify only to
belief.In the case of sickness, they testify to false belief.In the
case of a cure, they testify to a changed belief, to a belief of
recovered health, that is all.It is all on the basis of human belief,
you see."But--nerves feel--"

"Nerves, Doctor, like all matter, are externalizations of human
thought.Can the externalization of thought talk back to thought?You are still on the basis of mere human belief."At that moment the doctor leaned over and tapped upon the window to
attract the attention of some one in the street.Carmen looked out and
caught sight of a tall, angular man dressed in clerical garb.The man
bowed pleasantly to the doctor, and cast an inquiring glance at the
girl, then passed on."Yes, Tetham," said the doctor."Oh, is that the man who maintains the lobby here at the Capital for
his Church?He--well, it is his business to see
that members of his Church are promoted to political office, isn't it?He trades votes of whole districts to various congressmen in return
for offices for strong church members.He also got the parochial
schools of New York exempt from compulsory vaccination.The
Express--"

"Eh?Wales in his work on the cotton schedule.And so
we heard from Father Tetham.He is supporting the National Bureau of
Health bill.He is working for the Laetare medal.He--"

"Say, Miss Carmen, will you tell me where you pick up your news?Do you know something about everybody here in
Washington?""I have learned much here," she said, "about popular
government as exemplified by these United States.But it is especially saddening to see our
constitutional liberties threatened by this Bureau of Health bill, and
by the Government's constant truckling to the Church of Rome.Doctor,
can it be that you want to commit this nation to the business of
practicing medicine, and to its practice according to the allopathic,
or'regular' school?The American Medical Association, with its
reactionary policies and repressive tendencies, is making strenuous
endeavors to influence Congress to enact certain measures which would
result in the creation of such a Department of Health, the effect of
which would be to monopolize the art of healing and to create a
'healing trust.'If this calamity should be permitted to come upon the
American people, it would fall as a curtain of ignorance and
superstition over our fair land, and shut out the light of the dawning
Sun of Truth.It would mean a reversion to the blight and mold of the
Middle Ages, in many respects a return in a degree to the ignorance
and tyranny that stood for so many centuries like an impassable rock
in the pathway of human progress.The attempt to foist upon a
progressive people a system of medicine and healing which is wholly
unscientific and uncertain in its effects, but which is admittedly
known to be responsible for the death of millions and for untold
suffering and misery, and then to say, '_Thou shalt be cured thereby,
or not be cured at all_,' is an insult to the intelligence of the
Fathers of our liberties, and a crime upon a people striving for the
light.It smacks of the Holy Inquisition: You accept our creed, or you
shall go to hell--after we have broken you on the rack!Why, the
thought of subjecting this people to years of further dosing and
experimentation along the materialistic lines of the'regular' school,
of curtailing their liberties, and forcing their necks under the yoke
of medical tyranny, should come to them with the insistence of a
clarion call, and startle them into such action that the subtle evil
which lurks behind this proposed legislative action would be dragged
out into the light and exterminated!To permit commercialism and
greed, the lust of mammon, and the pride of the flesh that expresses
itself in the demand, 'Who shall be greatest?'to dictate the course
of conduct that shall shape the destinies of a great people, is to
admit the failure of free government, and to revert to a condition of
mind that we had thought long since outgrown.To yield our dear-bought
liberties to Italian ecclesiastics, on the other hand--well, Doctor,
_it is just unthinkable_!"Well, at least you are delightfully frank with me.Yet you have
the effect of making me feel as if--as if I were in some way behind a
veil.That--"

"Well, the human mind is very decidedly behind a veil--indeed, behind
many of them.Mankind just grope
about all their lives back of these veils, not knowing that God is
right before them all the time.God has got to be everything, or else
He will be nothing.With or without drugs, it is God 'who healeth all
thy diseases.'The difficulty with physicians is that they are densely
ignorant of what healing means, and so they always start with a
dreadful handicap.They believe that there is something real to be
overcome--and of course fail to permanently overcome it.Many of them
are not only pitiably ignorant, but are in the profession simply to
make money out of the fears and credulity of the people.Doctor, the
physician of to-day is in no way qualified to handle the question of
public health--especially those doctors who say: 'If you won't take
our medicines we'll get a law passed that will make you take them.'To
place the health of the people in their hands would be a terrible
mistake.The agitation for a federal Department of Health is based
upon motives of ignorance and intentional wrong.If the people
generally knew this, they would rise in a body against it.Make what
laws you wish for yourself, Doctor.The human mind is constantly
occupied in the making of ridiculous laws and limitations.But do not
attempt to foist your laws upon the people.Tell me, why all this
agitation about teaching sex-hygiene in the public schools?Why not,
for a change, teach Christianity?But even
the Bible has been put out of the schools.By your
Church, that its interpretation may continue to be falsely made by
those utterly and woefully ignorant of its true meaning!"For some moments they continued their meal in silence.Then the girl
took up the conversation again."Doctor," she said, "will you come out
from among them and be separate?""Ah, that is the rub, then!Yes, oppose ignorance and falsity, even
though incarnate in Mr."He ruins everybody who
stands in his way!The cotton schedule has gone against him, and the
whole country will have to suffer for it!""But how can he make the country suffer because he has been blocked in
his colossal selfishness?""That I can not answer," said the doctor."But I do know that he has
intimated that there will be no cotton crop in this country next
year."Ames stands as the claim of omnipotent
evil," was his laconic reply.And when the meal was ended, the girl went her way, pondering deeply.But that was something too
dark to be reported to the Express.*       *       *       *       *

Three weeks from the day he had his brush with Carmen in the presence
of the President, Ames, the great corruptionist, the master
manipulator, again returned from a visit to Washington, and in a
dangerous frame of mind.What might have been his mental state had he
known that the train which drew his private car also brought Carmen
back to New York, can only be conjectured.It was fortunate, no doubt,
that both were kept in ignorance of that fact, and that, while the
great externalization of the human mind's "claim" of business sulked
alone in his luxurious apartments, the little follower after
righteousness sat in one of the stuffy day coaches up ahead, holding
tired, fretful babies, amusing restless children, and soothing away
the long hours to weary, care-worn mothers.When the financier's car drew into the station his valets breathed
great sighs of relief, and his French chef and <DW64> porter mopped the
perspiration from their troubled brows, while silently offering peans
of gratitude for safe delivery.When the surly giant descended the car
steps his waiting footman drew back in alarm, as he caught his
master's black looks.When he threw himself into the limousine, his
chauffeur drew a low whistle and sent a timidly significant glance in
the direction of the lackey.And when at last he flung open the doors
of his private office and loudly summoned Hood, that capable and
generally fearless individual quaked with dire foreboding."The Express--I want a libel suit brought against it at once!"Yes, sir," responded the lawyer meekly.Then, in a voice trembling with
anger: "Have you read the last week's issues?"She has no financial interest in the paper, sir.And, as for the
reports which they have published--I hardly think we can establish a
case from them--"

"What?If you and he can't make out a case
against them, then I'll get a judge and a lawyer who can!I want that
bill filed to-morrow!""Very well, sir," assented Hood, stepping back."Another thing," continued Ames, "see Judge Hanson and have the
calling of the Ketchim case held in abeyance until I am ready for it.I've got a scheme to involve that <DW64> wench in the trial, and drag
her through the gutters!So, she's still in love with Rincon, eh?Well, we'll put a crimp in that little affair, I guess!Has Willett
heard from Wenceslas?""I'll lift the scalp from that blackguard Colombian prelate if he
tries to trick me!But the detectives report that he has been in Spain
recently."he exclaimed in a voice that began
high and ended in a whisper.He lapsed into a reflective mood, and for some moments his thoughts
seemed to wander far.Then he pulled himself together and roused out
of his meditations."You told Jayne that I would back the Budget to any extent, provided
it would publish the stuff I sent it?"You and Willett set about at once getting up daily
articles attacking the Express.I want you to dig up every move ever
made by Hitt, Haynerd, that girl, Waite, Morton, and the whole
miserable, sneaking outfit!Rake up every scandal, every fact, or
rumor, that is in any way associated with any of them.I want them
literally cannonaded by the Budget!Haynerd was a bum before he got the Social Era!Waite is an unfrocked
priest!That girl--that girl is
a--Did you know that she used to be in a brothel down in the red-light
district?Great record the publishers of the Express
have, eh?I want you and Jayne to bury that whole outfit
under a mountain of mud!I'm ready to spend ten millions to do it!"I think we can do it, Mr.Now, another matter: I'm out to get the President's
scalp!Begin with those New York papers which we
can influence.I'll get Fallom and Adams over here for a conference.Meanwhile, think over what we'd better say to them.Our attacks upon
the President must begin at once!I've already bought up a Washington
daily for that purpose.They have a few facts now that will discredit
his administration!"Ah--a--there is a matter that I must mention as
soon as you are ready to hear it, Mr.It seems
that the reports which that girl has made have been translated into
several languages, and are being used by labor agitators down there to
stir up trouble.The mill hands, you know, never really understood
what your profits were, and--well, they have always been quite
ignorant, you know, regarding any details of the business.But now
they think they have been enlightened--they think they see how the
tariff has benefited you at their expense--and they are extremely
bitter against you.That priest, Father Danny, has been doing a lot of
talking since the girl was down there."cried Ames, rising from his chair, then sinking back again.Ames," the lawyer continued, "the situation is fast
becoming acute.The mill hands don't believe now that you were ever
justified in shutting down, or putting them on half time.And, whether
you reduce wages or not, they are going to make very radical demands
upon you in the near future, unless I am misinformed.These demands
include better working conditions, better tenements, shorter hours,
and very much higher wages.Also the enforcement of the child labor
law, I am sorry to say."Ames, you know you have said that it would
strengthen your case with Congress if there should be a strike at
Avon."I am
distinctly out of favor with the President--owing to that little <DW64>
wench!And Congress is going against me if I lose Gossitch, Logue, and
Mall!That girl has put me in bad down there!By G--"

"But, Mr.Ames, she can be removed, can she not?"But--if we can drive the
Express upon the shoals, and then utterly discredit that girl, either
in the libel suit or the Ketchim trial, why, then, with a little show
of bettering things at Avon, we'll get what we want.Say, is--is Sidney with the Express?"Hood started, and shot a look of mingled surprise and curiosity at his
master.Was it possible that Ames--

"You heard my question, Mr.Yes, sir--Sidney is still with them.He--a--they say
he has quite conquered his--his--"

"You mean, he's no longer a sot?"Don't sit there like a smirking Chinese god!"Ames, I learn that Sidney has been cured of his habits, and
that the--that girl--did it," stammered the nervous lawyer.Ames's mouth jerked open--and then snapped shut.His
head slowly sank until his chin touched his breast.And as he sat thus
enwrapped, Hood rose and noiselessly left the room.Alone sat the man of gold--ah, more alone than even he knew.Alone
with his bruised ambitions, his hectored egoism, his watery aims.Alone and plotting the ruin of those who had dared bid him halt in his
mad, destroying career.Alone, this high priest of the caste of
absolutism, of the old individualism which is fast hurrying into the
realm of the forgotten.Alone, and facing a new century, with whose
ideals his own were utterly, stubbornly, hopelessly discrepant.Alone he sat, looking out, unmoved, upon the want and pain of
countless multitudes gone down beneath the yoke of conditions which he
had made too hard for them.Looking, unmoved, unhearing, upon the
bitter struggles of the weak, the ignorant, the unskilled, the gross
hewers of wood and drawers of water.Looking, and knowing not that in
their piteous cry for help and light was sounded his own dire peril.The door opened, and the office boy announced the chief stenographer
of the great bank below.Ames looked up and silently nodded permission
for the man to enter.Ames," the clerk began, "I--I have come to ask a favor--a
great favor.I am having difficulty--considerable difficulty in
securing stenographers, but--I may say--my greatest struggle is
with myself.Ames, I can not--I simply can not continue to
hire stenographers at the old wage, nine dollars a week!I know how
these girls are forced to live.Ames, with prices where they
are now, they can not live on that!Say,
ten or twelve dollars to start with?""Why do you come to me with your request?""Yes, sir, I know," replied the young man with hesitation."But--I--did
speak to him about it, and--he refused.""I can do nothing, sir," returned Ames in a voice that chilled the
man's life-current.I refuse to remain here and hire
stenographers at that criminal wage!""Very well, sir," replied Ames in the same low, freezing tone.Again the guardian of the sanctity of private property was left alone.Again, as he lapsed into dark revery, his thought turned back upon
itself, and began the reconstruction of scenes and events long since
shadowy dreams.And always as they built, the fair face of that young
girl appeared in the fabric.And always as he retraced his course, her
path crossed and crossed again his own.Always as he moved, her
reflection fell upon him--not in shadow, but in a flood of light,
exposing the secret recesses of his sordid soul.He dwelt again upon the smoothness of his way in those days, before
her advent, when that group of canny pirates sat about the Beaubien's
table and laid their devious snares.It was only the summer before she
came that this same jolly company had merged their sacred trust assets
to draw the clouds which that autumn burst upon the country as the
worst financial panic it had known in years.And so shrewdly had they
planned, that the storm came unheralded from a clear sky, and at a
time when the nation was never more prosperous.They had wagered that he could not put it
through.How neatly he had turned the trick, filled his pockets, and
transformed their doubts into wondering admiration!Oh, yes, there had been some suffering, he had been told.How surprised the people of these United
States would be some day to learn that this tropic struggle was in
essence an American war!The smug and unthinkingly contented in this
great country of ours regarded the frenzied combat in the far South as
but a sort of _opera bouffe_.And he,
when that war should end, would control navigation on the great
Magdalena and Cauca rivers, and acquire a long-term lease on the
emerald mines near Bogota.Untold suffering--countless
broken hearts--indescribable, maddening torture--he had not given that
a thought.His trip to Washington had been
exhausting.His eyes had been bloodshot,
and there had been several slight hemorrhages from the nose.His
physician had shaken his head gravely, and had admonished him to be
careful--

But why did that girl continue to fascinate him?Why now,
in all his scheming and plotting, did he always see her before him?Was it only because of her rare physical beauty?If he wrote or read,
her portrait lay upon the page; if he glanced up, she stood there
facing him.There was never accusation in her look, never malice, nor
trace of hate.No; but always she
smiled--always she looked right into his eyes--always she seemed to
say, "You would destroy me, but yet I love you."Aye, much more so than he did her.She would scorn the use of his
methods.He had to admit _that_, though he hated her, detested her,
would have torn her into shreds--even while he acknowledged that he
admired her, yes, beyond all others, for her wonderful bravery and her
loyal stand for what she considered the right.He must have dozed while he sat there in the warm office alone.Surely, that hideous object now floating before his straining gaze,
that thing resembling the poor, shattered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, was not
real!It was but a shadow, a flimsy thing of thought!And that
woestricken thing there, with its tenuous arms extended toward
him--was that Gannette?But, that other shade--so like his wife, a few months dead, yet alive
again!Whence came that look of horror in a face once so haughty!It
was unreal, ghastly unreal, as it drifted past!Ah, now he knew that
he was dreaming, for there, there in the light stood Carmen!Oh, what
a blessed relief to see that fair image there among those other
ghastly sights!He would speak to her--

But--_God above_!_What was that?_ A woman--no, not Carmen--fair
and--

Her white lips moved--they were transparent--he could see right
through them--and great tears dropped from her bloodless cheeks when
her accusing look fell upon him!Slowly she floated nearer--she stopped before him, and laid a hand
upon his shoulder--it was cold, cold as ice!He tried to call out--to
rise--to break away--

And then, groaning aloud, and with his brow dripping perspiration, he
awoke.Hood entered, but stopped short when he saw his master's white face.Ames passed a hand across his wet forehead."A--a little tired, that's
all, I guess.The lawyer laid a large envelope upon the desk."There's a delegation of Avon mill hands in the outer office.Again he
seemed to see that smiling girl before him.His jaw set, and his face
drew slowly down into an expression of malignity.Then, without
examining its contents, he tore the envelope into shreds, and cast the
pieces into the waste basket."Wire Pillette at
once to discharge these fellows, and every one else concerned in the
agitation!If those rats down there want to fight, they'll find me
ready!"CHAPTER 14


The immense frame of J. Wilton Ames bent slightly, and the great legs
might have been seen to drag a bit, as the man entered his private
elevator the morning after his rejection of the mill hands' demands,
and turned the lever that caused the lift to soar lightly to his
office above.And a mouse--had the immaculate condition of his
luxurious _sanctum_ permitted such an alien dweller--could have seen
him sink heavily into his great desk chair, and lapse into deep
thought.Hood, Willett, and Hodson entered in turn; but the magnate
gave them scant consideration, and at length waved them all away, and
bent anew to his meditations.Truth to tell--though he would not have owned it--the man was now
dimly conscious of a new force at work upon him; of a change, slowly,
subtly taking place somewhere deep within.He was feebly cognizant of
emotions quite unknown; of unfamiliar sentiments, whose outlines were
but just crystallizing out from the thick magma of his materialistic
soul.And he fought them; he hated them; they made him appear unto himself
weak, even effeminate!His abhorrence of sentimentalism had been among
the strongest of his life-characteristics; and yet, though he could
not define it, a mellowing something seemed to be acting upon him that
dull, bitterly cold winter morning, that shed a soft glow throughout
his mental chambers, that seemed to touch gently the hard, rugged
things of thought that lay within, and soften away their sharp
outlines.He might not know what lay so heavily upon his thought, as
he sat there alone, with his head sunk upon his breast.And yet the
girl who haunted his dreams would have told him that it was an
interrogation, even the eternal question, "What shall it profit a
man--?"Had ever such heavenly music touched his ears before!He would have held out his arms to her if he could.And yet, how dared she come to him?How dared she, after what she had
done?To
stand within the protection which her sex afforded and vivisect anew
his tired soul?But, whatever her motives, this girl did the most
daring things he had ever seen a woman do."Isn't it funny," she said, as she stood before him with a whimsical
little smile, "that wherever I go people so seldom ask me to sit
down!"Ames sank back into his seat without speaking.Carmen stood for a
moment looking about her rich environment; then drew up a chair close
to him."You haven't the slightest idea why I have come here, have you?"she
said sweetly, looking up into his face."I must confess myself quite ignorant of the cause of this unexpected
pleasure," he returned guardedly, bending his head in mock deference,
while the great wonder retained possession of him."Well," she went on lightly, "will you believe me when I tell you that
I have come here because I love you?"So this was an attack from
a different quarter!Hitt and Haynerd had invoked her feminine wiles,
eh?With one blow the unfamiliar sentiment which had been
shedding its influence upon him that morning laid the ugly suspicion
dead at his feet.A single glance into that sweet face turned so
lovingly up to his brought his own deep curse upon himself for his
hellish thought."You know," she bubbled, with a return of her wonted airy gaiety, "I
just had to run the gauntlet through guards and clerks and office boys
to get here.Aren't you glad I didn't send in my card?For then you
would have refused to see me, wouldn't you?""If I
had known you were out there," he said more gently, "I'd have sent out
and had you dragged in.I--I have wanted something this morning; and
now I am sure it was--"

"Yes," she interrupted, taking the words out of his mouth, "you wanted
_me_.You see, it's just absolutely impossible to
oppose anybody who loves you.You know, that's the very method Jesus
gave for overcoming our enemies--to love them, just love them to
pieces, until we find that we haven't any enemies at all any more.Well, that's the way I've been doing with
you--just loving you."The man's brows knotted, and his lips tightened.Or was there aught but the deepest sincerity expressed
in the face from which he could not take his eyes?And
yet, did ever human being talk so strangely, so weirdly, as she?"I thought you looked upon me as a human monster."After all,
there was a note of pathos in the question.Carmen laid her hand upon
his."It's the _real_ you that I love," she answered gently."The monster
is only human thought--the thought that has seemed to mesmerize you.But you are going to throw off the mesmerism, aren't you?I'll help
you," she added brightly."You're going to put off the 'old man'
completely--and you're going to begin by opening yourself and letting
in a little love for those poor people down at Avon, aren't you?At the mention of the people of Avon his face became stern and dark.She had not mentioned the Beaubien,
Miss Wall, the Express, nor herself."You see, you don't understand, Mr.You'll be, oh, so surprised
some day when you learn a little about the laws of thought--even the
way human thought operates!For you can't possibly do another person
an injury without that injury flying back and striking you.You may not feel the effects of its return right
away--but it does return, and the effects accumulate.And then, some
day, when you least expect it, comes the crash!But, when you love a
person, why, that comes back to you too; and it never comes alone.It
just brings loads of good with it.Ames," she cried, suddenly rising and seizing both his hands,
"you've just _got_ to love those people down there!You can't help it,
even if you think you can, for hate is not real--it's an awful
delusion!"It was not so much an appeal which the girl made as an affirmation of
things true and yet to come.The mighty _Thou shalt not!_ which Moses
laid upon his people, when transfused by the omnipotent love of the
Christ was transformed from a clanking chain into a silken cord.The
restriction became a prophecy; for when thou hast yielded self to the
benign influence of the Christ-principle, then, indeed, thou shalt not
desire to break the law of God.Carmen returned to her chair, and sat eagerly expectant.Ames groped
within his thought for a reply.And then his mental grasp closed upon
the words of Hood."They are very bitter against me--they hate me!""They reflect in kind your thought of
them.Your boomerangs of greed, of exploitation, of utter indifference
which you have hurled at them, have returned upon you in hatred.Do
you know that hatred is a fearful poison?And do you know that
another's hatred resting upon you is deadly, unless you know how to
meet and neutralize it with love?For love is the neutralizing
alkaloid.""Love is--weakness," he said in a low tone.Why, there is no such mighty power in the whole
universe as love!"We argue from different
standpoints," he said."I am a plain, matter-of-fact, cold-blooded
business man."And that," she replied in a voice tinged with sadness, "is why
business is such chaos; why there is so much failure, so much anxiety,
fear, loss, and unhappiness in the business world.Ames, you
haven't the slightest conception of real business, have you?"Then, brightly, "I am in business,
Mr.The business of
attempting to annihilate me!""I am in the business of reflecting good to you, and to all mankind,"
she gently corrected."Then suppose you manifest your love for me by refraining from
meddling further in my affairs.Suppose from now on you let me
alone.""Why--I am not meddling with you, Mr.He opened a drawer of the desk and took out several copies of
the Express."I am to consider that this is not strictly meddling,
eh?"he continued, as he laid the papers before her."No, not at all," she promptly replied."That's uncovering evil, so's
it can be destroyed.All that evil, calling itself you and your
business, has got to come to the surface--has got to come up to the
light, so that it can be--"

"Ah!Then I, the monster, must be exposed, eh?And the mines and mills which I
own--"

"You own nothing, Mr.Ames, except by consent of the people whom you
oppress.They will wake up some day; and then state and national
ownership of public utilities will come, forced by such as you.""And that desideratum will result in making everybody honest, I
suppose?"All our
present troubles, whether domestic, business, civic, or social, come
from a total misapprehension of the nature of God--a misunderstanding
of what is really _good_.We have _all_ got to prove Him.And we are
very foolish to lose any more time setting about it, don't you think
so?"You see," she went on, while he sat studying her, "those poor people
down at Avon don't know any more about what is the real good than you
do.And that's why their thoughts and yours center upon the false
pleasures of this ephemeral existence called life--this existence of
the so-called physical senses--and why you both become the tools of
vice, disease, and misfortune.They build up such men as you, and then
you turn about and crush them.And in the end you are both what the
Bible says--poor, deluded fools.""Well, I'll be--"

"Oh, don't swear!"she pleaded, again seizing his hand and laughing up
into his face."It's time you started to prove God," she said earnestly."Won't you
begin now--to-day?Haven't you yet learned that evil is the very
stupidest, dullest, most uninteresting thing in the world?Won't you turn from your material endeavors now, and take time
to learn to really live?You've got plenty of time, you know, for you
aren't obliged to work for a living."She was leaning close to him, and her breath touched his cheek.Her
soft little hand lay upon his own.And her great, dark eyes looked
into his with a light which he knew, despite his perverted thought,
came from the unquenchable flame of her selfless love.Again that unfamiliar sentiment--nay, rather, that sentiment long
dormant--stirred within him.Again his worldly concepts, long
entrenched, instantly rose to meet and overthrow it.He had not yet
learned to analyze the thoughts which crept so silently into his
ever-open mentality.And to those
which savored of things earthy he still gave the power to build, with
himself as a willing tool."You will--help me--to live?"He thought her the most
gloriously beautiful object he had ever known, as she sat there before
him, so simply gowned, and yet clothed with that which all the gold of
Ophir could not have bought."Yes, gladly--oh, so gladly!"Her eyes sparkled with a rush of tears."Don't you think," he said gently, drawing his chair a little closer
to her, "that we have quite misunderstood each other?"But," with a happy smile
again lighting her features, "we can understand each other now, can't
we?"And hasn't the time come for us to work together,
instead of continuing to oppose each other?""I--I have been thinking so ever since I returned yesterday from
Washington.I am--I--"

"We need each other, don't we?"the artless girl exclaimed, as she
beamed upon him."I can help
you--more than you realize--and I want to.I--I've been sorry for you,
little girl, mighty sorry, ever since that story got abroad about--"

"Oh, never mind that!""We are living in the
present, you know."And I
want to see them straightened out.And you and I can do it, little
one.Madam Beaubien hasn't been treated right, either."We're going to
forget that in the good we're going to do, aren't we?"And you are going to get a square deal.Now, I've got
a plan to make everything right.I want to see you in the place that
belongs to you.I want to see you happy, and surrounded by all that is
rightfully yours.And if you will join me, we will bring that all
about.I told you this once before, you may remember."He stopped and awaited the effect of his words upon the girl.Ames," she replied, her eyes shining with a great hope,
"don't think about me!It's the people at Avon that I want to help.""We'll help them, you and I. We'll make things right all round.And
Madam Beaubien shall have no further trouble."Sidney shall come home--"

With a rush the impulsive girl, forgetting all but the apparent
success of her mission, threw herself upon him and clasped her arms
about his neck."Oh," she cried, "it is love that has done all this!The startled man strained the girl tightly in his arms.He could feel
the quick throbbing in her throat.Her warm breath played upon his
cheek like fitful tropic breezes.For a brief moment the supreme gift
of the universe seemed to be laid at his feet.For a fleeting interval
the man of dust faded, and a new being, pure and white, seemed to rise
within him."Yes," he murmured gently, "we'll take him to our home with us."Slowly, very slowly, the girl released herself from his embrace and
stepped back.she murmured, searching his face for the
meaning which she had dimly discerned in his words.He reached forward and with a quick movement seized her
hand.Not now--no, you
needn't come to me until you are ready.Why, I didn't know until to-day what it was that was making
me over!Don't--"

Carmen had struggled away from him, and, with a look of bewilderment
upon her face, was moving toward the door."Oh, I didn't know," she
murmured, "that you were--were--proposing _marriage_ to me!"We'll begin all over again, you and I!Why, I'll do anything--anything
in the world you say, Carmen, if you will come to me--if you will be
my little wife!"I know--I know," he hastily resumed, as she halted and stood
seemingly rooted to the floor, "there is a great difference in our
ages.But that is nothing--many happy marriages are made between ages
just as far apart as ours.I'll make Madam Beaubien rich!I'll support the
Express, and make it what you want it to be!I'll do whatever you say
for the people of Avon!Think, little girl, what depends now upon
you!"Carmen turned and came slowly back to him."And--you will not do these
things--unless I marry you?"she said in a voice scarcely above a
whisper."I will do them all, Carmen, if you will come to me!""But--oh, you were only deceiving me all the time!And now--if I
refuse--then what?""It depends upon you, entirely--and you will come?Not now--but within
the next few months--within the year--tell me that you will!""But--you will do these things whether I come to you or not?""I've put it all into your hands," he answered shortly.Then
she glanced about in helpless bewilderment."I--I--love--you," she murmured, as she looked off toward the window,
but with unseeing eyes."I would do anything for you that was right.I--love--everybody--everybody; but there are no conditions to _my_
love.she suddenly cried, burying her face in her hands and
bursting into tears."You have tried to _buy_ me!"Taking her by the hand he led her,
unresisting, back to her chair."Listen," he said, bending toward her."Go home now and think it
all over.It was sudden, I admit; I
took you by surprise.But--well, you are not going to prevent the
accomplishment of all that good, are you?She had been crushed; and
another lesson in the cruelty of the human mind--that human mind which
has changed not in a thousand years--had been read to her.But again
she smiled bravely, as she wiped her eyes."It's all right now," she murmured."It was all right all the
time--and I was protected.""Some day," she said gently, and in a voice
that trembled just a little, "you will help the people of Avon, but
not because I shall marry you."Then you refuse my offer, do you?""Remember, all the blame will be upon you.She saw now with a clairvoyance which separated
him from the mask which he had worn.Her glance penetrated until it
found his soul."You have shown me the depths of the carnal mind," she slowly replied."The responsibility is not with me, but with--God.I--I came to-day
to--to help you.But now I must leave you--with Him."He stooped and took up her muff which lay upon the floor.As he did so,
a letter fell out.He seized it and glanced at the superscription.Another little _billet-doux_ to your
priestly lover, eh?"She looked down at the letter which he held."It is money," she said,
though her thought seemed far away."Money that I am sending to a
little newsboy who bears his name."He rose and opened a drawer in his desk.Taking out a paper-bound
book, he held it out to the girl."Here's a
little piece of work which your brilliant lover did some time ago.Do you know the penalty your
clerical paramour paid for that, eh?Then I'll tell you," bending over
close to her ear, "his _life_!"She staggered
a few steps toward the door, then stopped."God--is--is--_everywhere_!"Then she reeled, and fell heavily to the floor.CHAPTER 15


If additional proof of the awful cost of hating one's fellow-men were
required, the strike which burst upon the industrial world that winter
must furnish it in sickening excess.But other facts, too, were
rendered glaringly patent by that same desperate clash which made Avon
a shambles and transformed its fair name into a by-word, to be spoken
only in hushed whispers when one's thought dwells for a moment upon
the madness of the carnal mind that has once tasted blood.The
man-cleft chasm between labor and capital, that still unbridged void
which separates master and servant, and which a money-drunk class
insolently calls God-made, grows wider with each roar of musketry
aimed by a frenzied militia at helpless men and women; grows deeper
with each splitting crack of the dynamite that is laid to tear asunder
the conscienceless wielder of the goad; and must one day fall gaping
in a cavernous embouchure that will engulf a nation.Hitt saw it, and shuddered; Haynerd, too.Ames may have dimly marked
the typhoon on the horizon, but, like everything that manifested
opposition to this superhuman will, it only set his teeth the firmer
and thickened the callous about his cold heart.And she knew--and the world must some day know--that but one tie has
ever been designed adequate to bridge this yawning canon of human
hatred.Aye, well she knew that the world laughed,
and called it chimera; called it idealism, and emotional weakness.And well she knew that the most pitiable weakness the world has ever
seen was the class privilege which nailed the bearer of the creed of
love upon the cross, and to-day manifests in the frantic grasping of a
nation's resources, and the ruthless murder of those who ask that
they, too, may have a share in that abundance which is the common
birthright of all.Do the political bully, the grafter, the tout, know
the meaning of love?Oh, not by the
hypocritical millionaire pietists who prate their glib platitudes to
their Sunday Bible classes, and return to their luxurious homes to
order the slaughter of starving women and babes!They, like their poor
victims, are deep under the spell of that mesmerism which tells them
that evil is good.Nor by the Church, with its lamentable weakness of
knowledge and works.Only by those who have learned something of the
Christ-principle, and are striving daily to demonstrate its
omnipotence in part, can the world be taught a saving knowledge of the
love that solves every problem and creates a new heaven and a newer,
better concept of the earth and its fullness.That morning when Carmen went to see Ames the Express received word of
the walk-out of the Avon mill employes.Almost coincident with the
arrival of the news, Carmen herself came unsteadily into Hitt's
office.The editor glanced up at her, then looked a second time.He
had never before seen her face colorless."What work have you--for me--to-day?"Then, so low that he scarcely caught the
words, "I--I have been with--a friend."Sidney Ames came puffing into the office at that moment."How does it happen you're out riding with
Willett?Saw him help you out of an auto just now.""He brought me here," she answered softly.Hitt and the lad stared at her with open mouths.She turned, and
started for her own room, moving as if in a haze.As she neared the
door she stumbled.Sidney sprang after her and caught her in his arms.When she turned her face, they saw that her eyes were swimming in
tears.Hitt closed the door after him, then took
the girl's hand and led her back to his own chair."Now, little one,"
he said gently, "tell me all about it."Then the tears began to flow; and then she
leaned her head against him and sobbed--sobbed as does the stricken
mother who hangs over the lifeless form of her babe--sobbed as does
the strong man bereft of the friend of his bosom--sobbed as did the
Man of Sorrow, when he held out his arms over the worldly city that
cruelly rejected him.He was the channel for the divine; yet the
wickedness of the human mind broke his great heart.Carmen was not far
from him at that moment.Hitt held her hand, and choked back the lump that filled his throat.Then the weeping slowly ceased, and the girl looked up into his
anxious face."It's all past now," she said brokenly."Jesus forgave them that
killed him.And--"

"You have been with--Ames?"said Hitt in a low, quiet tone."And he
tried to kill you?""He--he knew not what he was doing.Evil used him, because as
yet he has no spiritual understanding."Well, little girl, I am waiting for the whole story.It
didn't happen--it wasn't real.I--I seemed to manifest weakness--and I
fell--to the floor--but I didn't lose consciousness."But what had Ames said to you, Carmen?"persisted Hitt, his face dark
with anger.Ames only as--as God's child," she
murmured."Evil is not real, and it doesn't happen.Now I want to
work--work as I never did before!_I must!_"

"Will you not tell me more about it?"he asked, for he knew now that a
deadly thrust had been made at the girl's life."It didn't happen," was her
reply.A suspicion flashed into Hitt's mind, kindled by the girl's insistence
upon the nothingness of death."Carmen," he asked, "did he tell you
that--some one had died?"She came to him and laid her head against him.I shall overcome it, for God is with me.Promise that no
one but us shall know!The man's eyes grew moist, and his throat filled.He drew the girl to
him and kissed her forehead."It shall be as you wish, little one," he
said in a choking voice.This is another
opportunity to--to prove God!He turned to his desk with a heavy heart."There is work to be done
now," he said."I wonder--"

She took the telegram from his hands and scanned it.At once she
became calm, her own sorrow swallowed up in selfless love."Oh, they
have gone out at Avon!Hitt, I must go there at once!""I thought so," he replied, swallowing hard.But you are in higher hands than mine, Carmen.And we, Sidney and I, will
say nothing of--of your visit to his father."*       *       *       *       *

That night Hitt called up the Beaubien and asked if he and Haynerd
might come and talk with her after the paper had gone to press, and
requesting that she notify Carmen and Father Waite.A few hours later
the little group met quietly in the humble cottage.Miss Wall and
Sidney were with them.And to them all those first dark hours of
morning, when as yet the symbol of God's omnipresence hung far below
the horizon, seemed prescient with a knowledge of evil's further
claims to the lives and fortunes of men."I have asked you here," Hitt gravely announced when they were
assembled, "to consider a matter which touches us all--how deeply, God
alone knows.At ten o'clock to-night I received this message."He
opened the paper which he held in his hand and read:

  "'Property of Hitt oil company, including derricks, pump houses,
  storage tanks, destroyed by fire.Dynamite in pump houses
  exploded, causing wells to cave and choke.The news burst over them like the cracking of a bomb.Haynerd, who,
like the others, had been kept in ignorance of the message until now,
started from his chair with a loud exclamation, then sank back limp.Evil seemed to have chosen that day with
canny shrewdness to overwhelm her with its quick sallies from out the
darkness of the carnal mind."I see in this," he said slowly, "the
culmination of a long series of efforts to ruin the Express.That my
oil property was deliberately wrecked, I have not the slightest doubt.demanded Haynerd, having again found his voice."The Express has stood before the world as a
paper unique and apart.And because of its high ideals, the forces of
evil singled it out at the beginning for their murderous assaults.That the press of this country is very generally muzzled, stifled,
bought and paid for, I have good reason now to know.My constant
brushes with the liquor interests, with low politicians, judges,
senators, and dive-keepers, have not been revealed even to you.Could
you know the pressure which the Church, both Catholic and Protestant,
has tried to exert upon us, you would scarce credit me with veracity.But the Express has stood out firm against feudalism, mediaevalism,
and entrenched ecclesiasticism.It has fearlessly opposed the
legalizing of drugging.It has fought the debauching of a nation's
manhood by the legalized sale of a deadly poison, alcohol.And it has
fought without quarter the pernicious activity of morally stunted
brewers and distillers, whose hellish motto is, 'Make the boys drink!'It has fought the money octopus, and again and again has sounded to
the world the peril which money-drunken criminals like Ames and his
clique constitute.And for that we must now wear the crown of
martyrdom!"Silence, dismal and empty, lay over the little room for a long time."The Express has not been self-supporting.Its
growth has been steady, but it has depended for its deficit upon the
revenue from my oil property.Ames ruined Madam
Beaubien financially, as well as Miss Wall.And now, knowing that we all depended upon my oil wells, he has, I
doubt not, completely removed that source of income.""But," exclaimed Haynerd, "your property was insured, wasn't it?""Yes," replied Hitt, with a feeble attempt at a smile."But with the
proviso that dynamite should not be kept on the premises.You will
note that dynamite wrecked the wells.That doubtless renders my
policies void.But, even in case I should have a fighting chance with
the insurance companies, don't you think that they will be advised
that I purposely set fire to the wells, in order to collect the
insurance?And I shall find myself with a big
lawsuit on my hands, and with no funds to conduct the fight.Ames's
work, you know, is always thorough, and the Express is already facing
his suit for libel.""But you told us you were going to mortgage your property," said Miss
Wall."I stood ready to, should the Express require it.But, with its recent
little boom, our paper did not seem to need that as yet," he
returned."Yes, Ned, God _is_ good!""Can you say that, after all you have
endured, Carmen?"He looked at her for a moment, lost in wonder."An outcast babe," he
murmured, "left on the banks of a great river far, far away; reared
without knowledge of father or mother, and amid perils that hourly
threatened to crush her; torn from her beloved ones and thrust out
into an unknown and unsympathetic world; used as a stepping-stone to
advance the low social ambitions of worldly women; blackened by the
foulest slander, and ejected as an outcast by those who had fawned at
her feet; still going about with her beautiful message of love, even
though knowing that her childhood home is enveloped in the flames of
war, and her dear ones scattered, perhaps lost; spurned from the door
of the rich man whom she sought to save; carrying with her always the
knowledge that the one upon whom her affections had centered had a son
in distant Cartagena, and yet herself contributing to the support of
the little lad; and now, this morning--" He stopped, for he remembered
his promise."This morning," she finished, "shielded by the One who is both Father
and Mother to me.""That One surely ought to love you, Carmen--"

"He does," she answered softly.put in Haynerd, torn with anger and fear."What are we going
to do now?""Everything, Ned, that error seems to tell us not to do," replied the
girl.She reached over to the little table that stood near, and took from it
a Bible.Opening it, she read aloud, very slowly, the entire
fourteenth chapter of Exodus.Then she concluded by reading the last
two verses of the eighth chapter of Romans."Now," she said, looking up, "we know what we are going to do, don't
we?We are going right on, as'seeing Him who is invisible' to men
like Mr."There is no curse, whether of the Church, or of business, or of any
department of human thought, that can overthrow legitimate business;
and we are in the legitimate business of reflecting God to the world.If the physical sense of supply is now lost, we are fortunate, for now
we are obliged to acquire a higher sense.And we become aware of it in our own consciousness.It is there
that we interpret His supply.Ames interprets it one way; we, in a
very different way.God has always been able to prepare a table in the
wilderness of human thought.If we look for supply from without, we
shall not find it, for everything is within.And the very fact that
there is a legitimate demand shows that there is the supply to meet
it, for--though the world hasn't learned this yet--_it is the supply
itself that really creates the demand_!""Money, Ned, is the counterfeit of God.He is
our Principle--infinite, inexhaustible.We are facing a crisis, but, like every seeming disturbance of
the infinite harmony, it will vanish in a little while if we but cling
to the divine Mind that is God for guidance."Hitt folded the telegram and returned it to his pocket."Are you going
to Avon to-morrow?""And when we have in our midst this girl, who has borne,
without one word of complaint or reviling, the world's most poignant
sorrows!I--I really regret that I told you of--of this telegram.I
seemed for a moment to be overwhelmed.But I am on my feet again
now!"He reached into a pocket and took out some bills, which he handed to
Carmen."That will see you through for a day or so down there.Come," he added,
beckoning to Haynerd, "the Express will be issued to-morrow as usual,
and we must get to bed.I've really had quite a strenuous day!"He
turned, then paused and looked at Carmen.The girl caught the meaning in his glance, and went directly to the
piano."Don't," he said, "if you do not feel like it.This day has been a
hard one for you, I know.And--"

"But I do feel like it," she answered, smiling up at him.And," her voice dropped low, "I want to sing to--Him."Hitt gulped down something in his throat."The bravest little girl in
the whole wide world!"*       *       *       *       *

The carnage at Avon was not incidental; it was the logical effect of
definite mental causes.It was the orderly sequence of an endless
train of hatred of man for man, bred of greed and the fear of
starvation.And starvation is the externalized human belief that life
is at the caprice of intelligent matter.But that is an infraction of
the first Commandment, given when the human race was a babe.When the mill hands left their looms at evening of the day following
Ames's rejection of their demands, the master closed the doors behind
them and locked them out.The parrot-cry of the maudlin sentimental!But, four thousand men, women, and little children, with never a
dollar beyond their earnings of the day, thrust out into the blasts of
the bitterest winter the New England states had known in years!True; but why, then, did they strike?For, you see, that of itself
proved the soundness of Ames's single reply to all further appeal:
"There is nothing whatever to arbitrate."In the garden of the human mind waves many a flower, both black and
red, fanned by the foul winds of carnal thought.There grow the
brothel, the dive, the gin-shop, the jail.About these hardier stems
twine the hospital, the cemetery, the madhouse, the morgue.And Satan,
"the man-killer from the beginning," waters their roots and makes
fallow the soil with the blood of fools.But of those for whom the
gardener waits, there is none whose blood is so life-giving to these
noxious plants as that type of the materially rich who, like Ames,
have waxed gross upon the flesh of their own brothers.Ames was a gambler in human lives.They were his chips, by which he
gained or lost, and of themselves were void of intrinsic value.The
world was the table whereon he played; the game _rouge et noir_, with
the whirl of predatory commercialism as the wheel, and the ball
weighted to drop where he might direct.He carried millions on margin,
and with them carried the destinies, for weal or for woe, of millions
of his fellow-men, with not one thought that he did so at the cost of
their honor and morality, not less than their life-blood.It had been his custom to close his mills for several months each
year, in order to save expense when times were dull.And he did this
as casually as he closed the doors of his stables, and with much less
thought for the welfare of those concerned.It is doubtful if he had
ever really considered the fact that these four thousand human beings
were wholly dependent upon him for their very existence.For he was a
business man, and gold was far weightier in the scale of values than
human flesh, and much less easily obtained.Cain's comforting
philosophy was quite correct, else would the business world not have
been so firmly established upon it.Besides, he was terribly busy; and
his life was lived upon a plane high, high above that upon which these
swarming toilers groveled with their snouts in the dust.And now, with the doors of his mills barred against the hungry hordes,
he would frame the terms upon which they should be reopened.The
eight-hour law must not be enforced.Perhaps he could influence the
Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, as depriving the mill
hands of the right to labor as long as they pleased.And the right to organize and band together for their
common good would be contemptuously denied the ignorant rats who
should be permitted to toil for him once more.If they offered
violence, there was the state militia, armed and impatient to slay.Also, this was an excellent opportunity to stamp out trade-unionism
within the confines of his activities.He would win the plaudits of
the whole industrial world by so doing.He therefore immediately got
in touch with the Governor, a Tammany puppet, and received that loyal
henchman's warm assurances of hearty support for any measures which
the great magnate might wish to enforce.He then approached the
officers of the state guard, and secured them to a man.Times were
hard, and they welcomed his favor.He finally posted armed guards in
all his buildings at Avon, and bade them remember that property rights
were of divine institution.Then he sat down and dictated the general
policy to be followed by the Amalgamated Spinners' Association
throughout the country in support of his own selfish ends.His activity in these preparations, as in everything, was tremendous.His agents swarmed over the state like ants.The Catholic Archbishop
was instructed that he must remove Father Danny from Avon, as his
influence was pernicious.But the objection was made that the priest
was engaged only in humanitarian labors.It availed not; Ames desired
the man's removal.The widow Marcus likewise had
been doing much talking.Ames's lawyer, Collins, had her haled into
court and thoroughly reprimanded.And then, that matters might be
precipitated, and Congress duly impressed with the necessity of
altering the cotton schedule in favor of the Spinners' Association,
Ames ordered his agents to raise the rents of his miserable Avon
tenements.There were few, he knew, who dared even attempt to meet the
raise; and those who could not, he ordered set into the streets.It was a wild winter's day that the magnate chose for the enforcement
of this cruel order.A driving blizzard had raged throughout the
night, and the snow had banked up in drifts in places many feet deep.The temperature was freezing, and the strong east wind cut like a
knife.It was Ames's desire to teach these scum a needed lesson, and
he had chosen to enlist the elements to aid him in the righteous
task.For a week, ever since the strike was declared, Carmen had lived among
these hectored people.Daily her reports of the unbearable situation
had gone to Hitt.And through them the editor had daily striven to
awaken a nation's conscience.Ames read the articles, and through the
columns of the Budget sought to modify them to the extent of shifting
the responsibility to the shoulders of the mill hands themselves, and
to a dilatory Congress that was criminally negligent in so framing a
cotton tariff as to make such industrial suffering possible.Nor did
he omit to foully vilify the Express and calumniate its personnel.Amid curses, screams, and despairing wails, the satanic work of
ejecting the tenement dwellers went on that day.Ames's hirelings,
with loaded rifles, assisted the constables and city police in the
miserable work, themselves cursing often because of the keen blasts
that nipped their ears and numbed their well-cased limbs.More than
one tiny, wailing babe was frozen at the breast that dull, drab
afternoon, when the sun hung like a ghastly clot of human blood just
above the horizon, and its weird, yellow light flitted through the
snow-laden streets like gaunt spectres of death.More than one aged,
toil-spent laborer, broken at the loom in the service of his
insatiable master, fell prone in the drifts and lay there till his
thin life-current froze and his tired heart stopped.More than one
frenzied, despairing father, forgetful for the moment of the divine
right of property, rushed at a guard and madly strove with him, only
to be clubbed into complaisance, or, perchance, be left in a welter of
crimson on the drifting snow.She had been to see
Pillette that same morning, and had been laughed from his presence.She did not understand, she was told, what miserable creatures these
were that dared ask for bread and human rights.Wait; they themselves
would show their true colors.And it spurted like fountains
from their veins.And they saw it with dimming eyes, and were glad,
for it brought sweet oblivion.That night there were great fires
built along the frozen creek.Shacks and tents were hastily reared;
and the shivering, trembling women and babes given a desperate
shelter.Then the men, sullen and grim, drew off into little groups,
and into the saloons and gambling halls of the town.And when the
blizzard was spent, and the cold stars were dropping their frozen
light, these dull-witted things began to move, slowly at first,
circling about like a great forming nebula, but gaining momentum and
power with each revolution.More than a thousand strong, they circled
out into the frozen streets of the little town, and up along the main
thoroughfare.Their low
curses welled into a roar.And then, like the sudden bursting of
pent-up lava, they swept madly through the town, carrying everything
to destruction before them.Stores, shops, the bank itself, burst open before this wave of
maddened humanity.Guns and pistols were thrown from laden shelves to
the cursing, sweating mob below.Axes and knives were gathered by
armfuls, and borne out into the streets to the whirling mass.Great
barrels of liquor were rolled into the gutters and burst asunder.Bread and meat were dragged from the shops and savagely devoured.The
police gathered and planted themselves with spitting pistols before
the human surge.They went down like grass under stampeded cattle.Frightened clerks and operators rushed to the wires and sent wild,
incoherent appeals for help to New York.Pandemonium had the reins,
the carnal mind was unleashed.On rolled the mob, straight on to the massive stone house of Pillette,
the resident manager of the great Ames mills.On over the high iron
fence, like hungry dock rats.On up the
broad drive, shouting, shooting, moaning, raving.On over the veranda,
and in through broken windows and shattered doors, swarming like flies
over reeking carrion, until the flames which burst through the peaked
roof of the mansion drove them forth, and made them draw sullenly,
protestingly away, leaving the tattered bodies of Pillette and his
wife and daughters to be consumed in the roaring furnace.Oh, ye workers, ye toilers at loom and forge, it is indeed you who
bear the world's burdens!It is you who create the rich man's wealth,
and fight his battles.So ye fought in the great war between North and
South, and protected the rich man at home, hovering in fright over his
money bags.It is you who put into his hands the bayonet which he
turns against you to guard his wealth and maintain his iniquitous
privilege.It is indeed in your hands that the destinies of this great
nation lie; but what will ye do with your marvelous opportunity?What, with your stupendous, untried strength?Will ye once more set up
the golden calf, and prostrate yourselves before it?Will ye again
enthrone ecclesiastical despotism, and grovel before image of Virgin
and Saint?Will ye raise high the powers of mediaeval darkness, and
bend your necks anew to the yoke of ignorance and stagnation?But
think you now that flames and dynamite will break your present bonds?Aye, America may be made a land without a pauper, without a
millionaire, without industrial strife.But fire and sword will not
effect the transformation.Yes, perhaps, as has been said, our
"comfortable social system and its authority will some day be blown to
atoms."But shall we then be better off than we are to-day?For shall
we know then how to use our precious liberty?Blood-drunk and reeling, the mob turned from the flaming wreckage and
flowed down toward the mills.There were some among them, saner, and
prescient of the dire consequences of their awful work, who counseled
restraint.Down into the creek
bottom rolled the seething tide, with a momentum that carried it up
the far side and crashing into the heavily barred oak doors of the
great mills.A crushing hail of bullets fell upon them, and their
leaders went down; but the mass wavered not.Those within the
buildings knew that they would become carrion in the maws of the
ravening wolves outside, and fought with a courage fed with
desperation.In the solemn hush of death Socrates said, "The hour of departure has
arrived, and we go our ways, I to die and you to live.And mankind through the ages in their last
hours have echoed this sentiment of the gentle philosopher.For all
human philosophy leads to a single end--resignation.The frenzied hordes swarming about the Ames mills knew in their heart
of hearts that death was preferable to life in death under the goad of
human exploitation.In the distance, across the swale, the sky glowed red where the souls
of the agent of predatory wealth and his family had gone out in
withering heat.In the stricken town, men huddled their trembling
loved ones about them and stood with loaded muskets.Somewhere on the
steel bands that linked this scene of carnage with the great
metropolis beyond, a train plunged and roared, leaping over the
quivering rails at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, bringing eager
militiamen and their deadly instruments of civilization.For the Ames
mills were private property.*       *       *       *       *

In his luxurious office in the tower of the Ames building the master
sat that black night, surrounded by his laboring cohorts.Though they
strained under the excitement of the hour, Ames himself remained calm
and determined.He was in constant communication with the Governor at
Albany, and with the municipal officers of both New York and Avon.He
had received the tidings of the destruction of the Pillette family
with a grim smile.But the smile had crystallized into an expression
of black, malignant hatred when he demanded of the Governor that the
New York contingent of the state guard be sent at once to protect his
property, and specified that the bullets used should be of the
"dum-dum" variety.Such
bullets had been prohibited by the rules of modern warfare, it was
true.And Ames, foreseeing it all, had
purchased a hundred thousand rounds of these hellish things for the
militia to exchange for those which the Government furnished.And
then, as an additional measure of precaution, he had sent Hood and
Collins into the United States District Court and persuaded the
sitting judge to issue an injunction, enjoining any possible relief
committees from furnishing food and shelter to such as might enter the
industrial conflict being waged against him.And in the blood-red haze that hung
before his glittering eyes was framed the face of the girl who had
spurned him but a few days before.She was the embodiment of love that
had crossed his path and stirred up the very quintessence of evil
within him.From the first she had
aroused within his soul a conflict of emotions such as he had never
known before.And from the night when, in the Hawley-Crowles box at
the opera he had held her hand and looked down into her fathomless
eyes, he had been tortured with the conflicting desires to possess
that fair creature, or to utterly destroy her.Always she hovered just within his
grasp; and then drew back as his itching fingers closed.Always she
told him she loved him--and he knew she lied not.And such love had
its price--but not hers.And so hope strove with wrath, and chagrin
with despair.And
with it she had laid the giant low and bound him with chains.Though he knew now that she was lost to him forever; though
with foul curses he had seen hope flee; yet with it he had also bidden
every tender sentiment, every last vestige of good depart from his
thought forever more.And:

              "----with hope, farewell fear,
              Farewell remorse: all good to me is lost;
              Evil, be thou my good!"And that night the master slept
not, but sat alone at his desk in the great Fifth Avenue mansion, and
plotted the annihilation of every human being who had dared oppose his
worldly ambitions.Plotted, too, the further degradation and final
ruin of the girl who had dared to say she loved him, and yet would not
become his toy.*       *       *       *       *

There is no need to curse the iniquitous industrial and social system
upon which the unstable fabric of our civilization rests, for that
system is its own fell curse in the rotting fruit it bears.A bit of
that poisonous fruit had now dropped from the slimy branch at Avon.Up
from the yards came the militiamen at double-quick, with rifles
unslung and loaded with the satanic Ames bullets.Behind them they
dragged two machine guns, capable of discharging three hundred times a
minute.The mob had concentrated upon the central building of the mill
group, and had just gained entrance through its shattered doors.Before them the guards were falling slowly back, fighting every inch
of the way.The air was thick with powder
smoke.The roar of battle was
deafening.Quickly swinging into action, the militia opened upon the mill hands.Hemmed in between two fires, the mob broke and fled down the frozen
stream.The officers of the guard then ordered their men to join in
the work of extinguishing the flames, which were beginning to make
headway, fanned by the strong draft which swept through the long
building.Then, the building
saved, they pitched their tents and sought a brief rest.At noon the soldiers were again assembled, for there remained the task
of arresting the leaders of the mob and bringing them to justice.The
town had been placed under martial law with the arrival of the
militia.Its streets were patrolled by armed guards, and a strong
cordon had been thrown around the shacks which the mill hands had
hastily erected the afternoon before.And now, under the protection of
a detachment of soldiers, the demand was made for the unconditional
surrender of the striking laborers.Dull terror lay like a pall over the miserable shacks huddled along
the dead stream.It was the dull, hopeless, numbing terror of the
victim who awaits the blow from the lion's paw in the arena.Weeping
wives and mothers, clasping their little ones to them, knelt upon the
frozen ground and crossed themselves.Young men drew their newly-wed
mates to their breasts and kissed them with trembling lips.Stern,
hard-faced men, with great, knotted hands, grouped together and looked
out in deadly hatred at the heartless force surrounding them.Then out from among them and across the ice went Carmen, up the
slippery hillside, and straight to the multi-mouthed machine gun, at
the side of which stood Major Camp.She had been all night with these
bewildered, maddened people.She had warmed shivering babes at her own
breast.She had comforted widows of a night, and newly-bereaved
mothers.She had bound up gaping wounds, and had whispered tender
words of counsel and advice.And they had clung to her weeping; they
had called upon Virgin and Saint to bless her; and they named her the
Angel of Avon--and the name would leave her no more."Take me," she said, "take me into court, and let me tell all."This beautiful, well-clad girl among
such miserable vermin!"You have demanded their leaders," she continued."I have been trying
to lead them.The major's eyes roved over her face and figure.He could make nothing
out of her words, but he motioned to an aid, and bade him place the
girl under arrest.A wild shout then rose from the shacks, as Carmen moved quietly away
under guard.A dozen men sprang out and rushed, muskets in
hand, up toward the soldiers to liberate her.Their narrow vision could
comprehend but one thing at a time; and they saw in the arrest of the
girl only an additional insult piled upon their already mountainous
injuries.It was answered by a shriek of rage from the hovels, and a murderous
return fire.Then the major gave another loud command, and the machine
guns began to vomit forth their clattering message of death.At the sound of shooting, Carmen's guard halted.Then one of them
fell, pierced by a bullet from the strikers.The others released the
girl, and hurried back to the battle line.Carmen stood alone for a
moment.One sang its death-song almost in her ear.Then she turned and made her way slowly up the hill to the
paralyzed town.Down in the vale beneath, Death swung his scythe with long, sweeping
strokes.The two machine guns poured a flaming sheet of lead into the
little camp below.The tents
caught fire, and were whirled blazing aloft by the brisk wind.Men
dropped like chaff from a mill.Hysterical, screaming women rushed
hither and yon to save their young, and were torn to shreds by the
merciless fusillade from above.Babes stood for a moment bewildered,
and then sank with great, gaping wounds in their little, quivering
bodies.And over all brooded the spirit of the great manipulator,
Ames, for the protection of whose sacred rights such ghastly work is
done among civilized men to-day.*       *       *       *       *

That night, while the stars above Avon drew a veil of gray between
them and the earth below, that they might not see the red embers and
stark bodies, Carmen came slowly, and with bent head, into the office
of the Express.As she approached Hitt's door she heard him in earnest
conversation with Haynerd."Yes," the editor was saying, "I had a mortgage placed on the Express
to-day, but I couldn't get much.And it's a short-term one, at that.Stolz refused point blank to help us, unless we would let him dictate
the policy of the paper.He's still
fighting Ames for control of C. and R. And I learn, too, that the
Ketchim case is called for next week.That probably means an attempt
by Ames to smoke Stolz out through Ketchim.It also means that
Carmen--"

"Yes; what about her?""That she will be forced to go upon the stand as a witness.""And that, as I read it, means a further effort on Ames's part to
utterly discredit her in the eyes of the world, and us through her
association with the Express.""But--where is she, Hitt?No word from her since we got the news of
the massacre at Avon this afternoon!Nothing happened to her, do you
think?"Hitt's face was serious, and he did not answer.Then Carmen herself
came through the open door.Both men rose with exclamations of
gladness to welcome her.The girl's eyes were wet, and her wonted
smile had gone.Hitt," she said, "I want a thousand dollars to-night."Hitt and Haynerd both sat down hard."I must go back to Avon to-morrow," she announced."And the money is
for the--the people down there."Her voice caught, and her words
stumbled.The two men looked at each other blankly.Then Hitt reached out and
took her hand."Tell us," he said, "about the trouble there to-day.""No," she said, "we will not talk about evil.A thousand--"

"I have that much on deposit in the bank now, Carmen," he replied
gravely.His thought was on the mortgage which he had signed that
morning."Then write me a check at once, and I will deposit it in the Avon bank
when I get there to-morrow.I must go home now--to see mother.""But--let me think about it, Carmen.Money is--well, won't less than
that amount do you?"Hitt sighed, but made no further protest.If the Express must founder,
then this money were well spent on the stricken people of Avon.He
took out his book, and immediately wrote the check and handed it to
the girl."Hitt," said Haynerd, after Carmen had left them and he had exhausted
his protests over the size of the check, "something's killing that
girl!And it isn't only the trouble at Avon, either!"She's no longer in this world, Ned.But Hitt would say nothing to further illuminate his cryptic remark,
and Haynerd soon switched to the grim topic of the industrial war in
progress at Avon.A
social and industrial system such as ours, which leaves the masses to
starve and consume with disease under intolerable burdens, that a
handful may rot in idleness and luxury, marks us in this latest
century as hopelessly insane!""Well, Ned, whence came the idea, think you, that it is divine justice
for a majority of the people on earth to be poor in order that a few
may be rich?And how are we going to get that perverted idea out of
the minds of men?"Legislation arouses no faith in me!We are
suffering here because, in our immensely selfish thought of ourselves
only, we have permitted the growth of such men as Ames, and allowed
them to monopolize the country's resources.Future
generations will laugh themselves sick over us!Why, what sane excuse
is there for permitting the commonest necessities of life to be
juggled with by gamblers and unmoral men of wealth?How can we ask to
be considered rational when we, with open eyes, allow 'corners' on
foodstuffs, and permit 'wheat kings' to amass millions by corralling
the supply of grain and then raising the price to the point where the
poor washerwoman starves?The
existence of poverty in a country like America is not only proof
positive that our social system is rotten to the core, but that our
religion is equally so!As a people we deserve to be incarcerated in
asylums!""A considerable peroration, Ned," smiled Hitt."And yet, one that I
can not refute.The only hope I see is in a radical change in the
mental attitude of the so-called enlightened class--and yet they are
the very worst offenders!"Doesn't the militia exist for men like Ames?To-day's work at
Avon proves it, I think!""Apparently so, Ned," returned Hitt sadly."And the only possibility
of a change in enlightened people is through a better understanding of
what is really good and worth while."Seems to me, Hitt, that it ought to stagger our preachers to realize
that nineteen centuries of their brand of Christianity have scarcely
even begun to cleanse society.What do you suppose Borwell thinks,
anyway?""Ned, they still cling to human law as necessarily a compelling
influence in the shaping of mankind's moral nature.""And go right on accepting the blood-stained money of criminal
business men who have had the misfortune to amass a million dollars!And, more, they actually hold such men up as patterns for the youth to
emulate!As if the chief end of endeavor were to achieve the glorious
manhood of an Ames!And he a man who is deader than the corpses he
made at Avon to-day!""The world's ideal, my friend, has long been the man who succeeds in
everything except that which is worth while," replied Hitt."But we
have been bidden to come out from the world, and be separate."Y--e--s, of course.But I can't take my thought from Avon--"

"And thereby you emphasize your belief in the reality of evil.""Then, if that is so, why not resign your position, Ned?Not while the Express has a leg to stand on!Your words are
an offense to me, sir!"Hitt rose and clapped his friend heartily on the back.Things do look very dark for us, if we look only with
the human sense of vision.But we are trying to look at the invisible
things within."Ned, Carmen is not in our hands.*       *       *       *       *

On the following afternoon at three a little group of Avon mill hands
crept past the guards and met in Father Danny's Mission, down in the
segregated vice district.They met there because they dared not go
through the town to the Hall.He had
slipped into town the preceding night, and remained in hiding through
the day.She had gone first to the
Hall, and then to the Mission, when she arrived again in the little
town.And after she had deposited Hitt's check in the bank she had
asked Father Danny to call together some of the older and more
intelligent of the mill hands, to discuss methods of disbursing the
money.Almost coincident with her arrival had come an order from Ames to
apprehend the girl as a disturber of the peace.The hush of death lay
over Avon, and even the soldiers now stood aghast at their own bloody
work of the day before.Carmen had avoided the main thoroughfares, and
had made her way unrecognized.At a distance she saw the town jail,
heavily guarded.Its capacity had been sorely taxed, and many of the
prisoners had been crowded into cold, cheerless store rooms, and
placed under guards who stood ready to mow them down at the slightest
threatening gesture.whispered Father Danny, after he had quietly
greeted the girl.It may be the beginning of the great
revolution we've all known wasn't far off!I just _had_ to get back
here!He sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.But soon he
sprang to his feet."No time for mollycoddling!""Come,
men, we'll give you checks, and do you get food for the babies.Only,
don't buy of the company stores!""We'll have to, Father," said one of them."But they've never taken cash from you there, ye know."Aye, Father, and they've discounted that ten per cent each time.But
if we bought at other stores we were discharged."But now then, Miss
Carmen, we'll begin."For an hour the girl wrote small checks, and the priest handed them
out to the eager laborers.They worked feverishly, for they knew that
at any moment they might be apprehended.cried Father Danny, at last unable to restrain himself."Did ye but know that this grand nation is wholly dependent on such as
you, its common people!Not on the rich, I say, the handful that own
its mills and mines, but on you who work them for your rich masters!"Ah, lass, it's but love that I'm dealin' out to 'em, God knows!And
yet, it's they that are masters of the situation, only they don't know
it!They've no leaders, except such as waste their
money and leave 'em in the ditch!The world's social schemes, Miss
Carmen, don't reach such as these.And they've got
the contempt of the wage-earners.""The Church, Father, could do much for these people, if--"

"Don't hesitate, Miss Carmen.You mean, if we didn't give all our
thought to the rich, eh?But still, it's wholly up to the people
themselves, after all.And, mark me, when they do rise, why, such men
as Ames won't know what's hit 'em!"The door was thrown violently open at that moment, and a squad of
soldiers under the command of a lieutenant entered.Carmen and Father Danny rose and faced them.The mill hands stood like
stone images, their faces black with suppressed rage.The lieutenant
halted his men, and then advanced to the girl."Is a woman named Carmen Ariza here?""I am she," replied the fearless girl."Come with us," he said in a rough voice.cried Father Danny, suddenly pulling the girl
back and thrusting himself before her.The mill hands
quickly formed about the girl.And then, with a yell of rage, they
threw themselves upon the soldiers.For a few minutes the little room was a bedlam.The crazed strikers
fought without weapons, except such as they could wrest from the
soldiers.One of them seized Carmen and
threw her beneath the table at which she had been working.The shouting and cursing might have been
heard for blocks around.Father Danny stood in front of the table,
beneath which lay the girl.He strove desperately to maintain his
position, that he might protect her, meantime frantically calling to
the mill hands to drag her out to the rear, and escape by the back
door.In the midst of the _melee_ a soldier mounted a chair near the door
and raised his rifle.The shot roared out, and Father Danny pitched
forward to the floor.Another shot, and still another followed in
quick succession.Then
they turned and fled precipitately through the rear exit.The lieutenant dragged Carmen from beneath the table and out through
the door.Then, assembling his men, he gave an order, and they marched
away with her up the icy street to the town jail.CHAPTER 16


With the wreckage which he had wrought strewn about him, J. Wilton
Ames sat at his rich desk far above the scampering human ants in the
streets below and contemplated the fell work of his own hands.And
often and anon as he looked, great beads of perspiration welled out
upon his forehead, and his breath came hot and dry.In the waste
basket at his feet lay crumpled the newspapers with their shrieking,
red-lettered versions of the slaughter at Avon.He was not a coward,
this man!But he had pushed that basket around the desk out of his
sight, for when he looked at it something rose before him that sent a
chill to his very soul.At times his vision blurred; and then he
passed his hands heavily across his eyes.He had chanced to read in
the grewsome accounts of the Avon massacre that little children had
been found among those fallen shacks, writhing in their last agonies.And the reports had said that great, red-dripping holes had been
ripped in their thin little bodies by those awful "dum-dum" bullets.And why had the demoniac soldiers down
there blown the brains from harmless women and helpless babes?He
really had not intended to go so far!The brats would have grown up to oppose
the vested privileges of the rich!They, too, would have become
anarchists and rioters, bent on leveling the huge industrial fabric
which such as he had so laboriously erected under the legal protection
afforded their sacred rights!And
the great captains of industry would thank him for the example he had
thus fearlessly set!To think of Avon was for him now to think in terms of blood.And yet
his carnal soul hourly wrestled sore with thoughts of a wholly
different stamp; with those strange emotions which he had felt when in
Carmen's presence; with those unfamiliar sentiments which, had he not
fought them back so bitterly, might have made him anew, and--

But the remembrance maddened him.His face grew black, and his mouth
poured forth a torrent of foul imprecations and threats upon her and
upon those who stood with her.He smote the
desk with his great fist.He fumed, he frothed, he hurled reason from
its throne, and bade the Furies again become his counselors.Upon the desk before him lay the mortgage papers which Hitt had
signed.He had bought the mortgage from the bank which had loaned the
Express the money.He would crush that sheet now, crush it until the
ink dripped black from its emasculated pages!And when it fell into
his hands, he would turn it into the yellowest of sensational
journals, and hoot the memory of its present staff from ocean to
ocean!Then, his head sunk upon his breast, he fell to wondering if he might
not secure a mortgage upon the Beaubien cottage, and turn its
occupants into the street.It was the
lever by which he moved the world, and clubbed its dull-witted
inhabitants into servile obeisance!Who could stand against him--

That girl!That obedient lackey hastened
into his master's presence."Called for this week, sir," replied Hood, glad that the announcement
could not possibly offend his superior."Brought up from Avon, and lodged in the Tombs, sir.""You tell Judge Spencer that if he allows her bail I'll see that his
federal appointment is killed, understand?"Ames regarded the man with a mixture of admiration and utter contempt.For Hood stood before him a resplendent example of the influence of
the most subtle of all poisons, the insidious lure of money.Soul and
body he had prostituted himself and his undoubted talents to it.And
now, were he to be turned adrift by Ames, the man must inevitably sink
into oblivion, squeezed dry of every element of genuine manhood, and
weighted with the unclean lucre for which his bony fingers had always
itched.He knows most about the formation of the defunct
Simiti company.""Well, see him and--you say he's young, and got a wife and baby?Offer
him twenty-five thousand to quit the case.""I'm afraid it wouldn't do, sir," returned Hood, shaking his head
dubiously."I've had men talking with him regarding the trial, and
he--"

"Then get him over here.I'll see if I can't persuade him," growled
Ames in an ugly tone.A few minutes later Reverend Darius Borwell
was ushered into the financier's private office.Ames," cried that gentleman of the cloth, "it's shocking,
terribly so, what those unbridled, unprincipled mill hands have drawn
upon themselves down in Avon!And four members of the Church
of the Social Revolution came to my study last evening and demanded
that I let them speak to my congregation on the coming Sabbath!"And I shall
have policemen stationed at the doors next Sunday to maintain order!To think that it has come to this in America!I would advise--"

"Nobody can get within a block of my house, sir, without ringing a
series of electric bells," replied Ames evenly."I have fifty guards
and private detectives in attendance in and about my premises all the
time.My limousine has been lined with sheet steel.I simply want to keep going
until I can carry out a few plans I have in hand."His thought had
reverted again to the fair girl in the Tombs."But now, Borwell," he continued, "I want to talk with you about
another matter.I am drawing up my will, and--"

"Why, my dear Mr.Ames thought of his physician's constantly iterated warning; but shook
his head."I may get caught in this Avon affair," he said evasively.The President has sent his message to
Congress, as you may be aware.There are unpleasant suggestions in it
regarding dispossession in cases like my own.I'm coming back by
magnanimously willing to Congress a hundred millions, to stand as a
fund for social uplift.""But the little matter I wish to discuss with you is the sum that I am
setting aside for the erection of a new church edifice," continued
Ames, eying the minister narrowly.cried that worthy gentleman, springing up and
clasping the financier's hand.One should not be too precipitate in
accepting tentative benefactions."Ah--we really should have--ah--a
trifle more, Mr.There's the settlement home, and the commons,
you know, and--"

"Humph!Well, we'll start with half a million," replied Ames dryly."By the way, you know Jurges, eh?Er--have
you any particular influence with him, if I may ask?"His sharp eyes
bored straight through the wondering divine."Why--yes--yes, I know the gentleman.And, as for influence--well, I
may--"

"Yes, just so," put in Ames."Now there is a trial coming up this
week, and Jurges will be called to the stand.I want you to give him
the true facts in regard to it.I'll call Hood, and we'll go over them
in detail now.Then you see Jurges this afternoon, and--say, he's
raising a building fund too, isn't he?"The magnate summoned Hood again; and for an hour the trio discussed
the forthcoming trial of the unfortunate Philip O. Ketchim.Then Ames
dismissed the clergyman, and bade his office boy admit the young
lawyer, Cass, who had come in response to Hood's request.For some moments after Cass entered the office Ames stood regarding
him, studying what manner of man he was, and how best to approach him.Then he opened the conversation by a casual reference to the
unsatisfactory business situation which obtained throughout the
country, and expressed wonder that young men just starting in their
professions managed to make ends meet."But," he concluded with deep significance, "better go hungry than
take on any class of business which, though promising good money
returns, nevertheless might eventually prove suicidal."He looked hard
at the young lawyer when he paused."But as I am
particularly busy this morning, may I ask why you have sent for me?Have you anything that I can--"

"I have," abruptly interrupted the financier."We need additions to
our legal staff.I thought perhaps you might like to talk over the
matter with me, with a view to entering our employ."Ames, I--I have never thought of--" The young man's eyes
glistened."Well, suppose you think of it now," said Ames, smiling graciously."I
have heard considerable about you of late, and I must say I rather
like the way you have been handling your work."The work which he had been
doing of late was most ordinary and routine, and called for no display
of legal skill whatever."I'd hate to see you tackle anything at this stage of your career, Mr.And I am afraid your
association with Ketchim is going to do just that.But possibly you do
not intend to handle further business for him?"Ketchim, though long confined in the Tombs, had at length secured
bail, through the not wholly disinterested efforts of his uncle,
Stolz, the sworn enemy of Ames.And, because of his loyal efforts in
behalf of Ketchim, Stolz had insisted that Cass be retained as counsel
for the latter when his trial should come up."I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr.Hood
will take you on at a salary of, say, five thousand to start with.We'll try you out for a few weeks.Then, if we don't mutually fit,
why, we'll quietly separate and say nothing.Half of that salary would have looked large to him
then.But--

"May I ask," he slowly said in reply, "what class of work Mr.Hood
would give me to start with?""Why, nothing of great importance, perhaps, while you are getting into
the harness.You've had experience
in that, eh?"That little house
which he had passed and stopped to look at so wistfully every night on
his way home was now within his grasp.He glanced up at the great man, sitting so calmly before him.Ames," he said, "if I enter your employ, it must be with the
stipulation that I shall have nothing to do with the Ketchim trial.""If you enter my employ, sir, it will
be with the stipulation that you do as I say," he returned coldly.And then the young lawyer saw through the mask.And his anger flamed
high at what he discerned behind it.Ames," said he, "you have made a mistake.I am poor, and I need
business.But I have not as yet fallen so completely under the spell
of fortune-hunting as to sell my honor to a man like you!To enter
your employ, I now see, would mean the total loss of character and
self respect.It would mean a lowering of my ideals, whatever they may
be, to your own vulgar standard.I may have done wrong in becoming
associated with Mr.But I
pledged myself to assist him.And yet, in doing so, I scarcely can
blacken my reputation to the extent that I should were I to become
your legal henchman.But there are some terms upon
which even I can not accept it.Ames gave a snort of anger when Cass went out.Summoning Hood, he
vented his great wrath upon that individual's bald pate."And now," he
concluded, "I want that fellow Cass so wound up that he will sneak off
to a lonely spot and commit suicide!And if you can't do it, then I'll
accept your resignation!"Ames, I have
just learned that Judge Harris, father of the young man who came up
with that girl, is in Colombia.Seems that he's taken some wealthy man
down there to look at La Libertad mine.""They believe you put one over on Ketchim, with the help of Monsignor
Lafelle, and so they've gone down to get titles to that mine.""By G--"

"And they say that--"

"Never mind what they say!""Cable Wenceslas at once to
see that those fellows remain permanently in Colombia.He has ways of
accomplishing that.I guess
Wenceslas can block his little game!"His great frame shook slightly as he stood consuming with rage, and a
slight hemorrhage started from his nostrils.And as he walked, Hood thought his left foot dragged
slightly.*       *       *       *       *

And then, with the way well cleared, came the Ketchim trial, which has
gone down in history as containing the most spectacular _denouement_
in the record of legal procedure in the New World.Had it been
concerned, as was anticipated, only with routine legal procedure
against the man Ketchim, a weak-souled compound of feeble sycophancy
and low morals, it would have attracted slight attention, and would
have been spread upon the court records by uninterested clerks with
never a second thought.But there were elements entering into it of
whose existence the outside world could not have even dreamed.Into it
converged threads which now may be traced back to scenes and events in
three continents; threads whose intricate windings led through
trackless forest and dim-lit church; through court of fashion and hut
of poverty; back through the dark mazes of mortal thought, where no
light shines upon the carnal aims and aspirations of the human mind;
back even to the doors of a palace itself, even to the proudest throne
of the Old World.But none of these elements found expression in the indictment against
the frightened defendant, the small-visioned man who had sought to
imitate the mighty Ames, and yet who lacked sufficient intelligence of
that sort which manifests in such a perversion of skill and power.Ames was a tremendous corruptionist, who stood beyond the laws simply
because of the elemental fact that he himself made those laws.Ketchim
was a plain deceiver.Mingling
his theology with fraud, he employed the unholy alliance for the
purpose of exploiting the credulous who attended his prayer meetings
and commented with bated breath upon his beautiful showing of
religious zeal.He was but one of a multitude afflicted with the
"dollar mania."His misfortune was that his methods were so antique
that they could not long fail of detection.And it was because of his
use of the mails for the purpose of deceit that the indictment had
been drawn against Philip O. Ketchim _et al._ by the long-suffering,
tolerant complainant, called the people.Nominally the people's interests were in the hands of the Public
Prosecutor, a certain smug young worldling named Ellis.But, as that
gentleman owed his appointment to Ames, it is not surprising that at
his right hand sat Hood and his well trained staff.Nominally, too,
Judge Spencer conducted the trial strictly upon its merits, not all of
which lay with the people.But the judge might have been still
prosecuting petty cases back in the unknown little district from
which he came, had it not been for the great influence of Ames, long
since, who had found him on a certain occasion useful.And so the jury
panel contained none but those who, we may be very sure, were amenable
to the tender pressure of a soft hand lined with yellow gold.And only
those points of evidence were sustained which conduced to the
incrimination of the miserable defendant.Ketchim was doomed before
the trial began.And yet, to subserve the dark schemes of Ames, and to lengthen the
period of torture to which his victims should be subjected, the trial
was dragged through many days.Besides, even he and his hirelings were
bound to observe the formalities.It was at the suggestion of Cass that no effort had been made to
procure bail for Carmen after her arrest.The dramatic may always be
relied upon to carry a point which even plain evidence negatives.And
she, acquiescing in the suggestion, remained a full two weeks in the
Tombs before Ames's eager counsel found their opportunity to confront
her on the witness stand and besmirch her with their black charges.The Beaubien was prostrated.But, knowing that for her another hour of
humiliation and sorrow had come, she strove mightily to summon her
strength for its advent.Father Waite toiled with Cass day and night.Hitt and Haynerd, without financial resources, pursued their way, grim
and silent.And
they stood at the helm, stanch to their principles, not yielding an
iota to offers of assistance in exchange for a reversal of the policy
upon which the paper had been launched."We're going down, Hitt," said Haynerd grimly."But we go with the
flag flying at the mast!"He was learning to know as did Carmen, and to
see with eyes which were invisible.It was just when the jury had been impaneled, after long days of petty
wrangling and childish recrimination among the opposing lawyers, that
Stolz came to Ames and laid down his sword.The control of C. and R.
should pass unequivocally to the latter if he would but save Ketchim
from prison.Then Ames lay back and roared with laughter over his great triumph.He would send Stolz' nephew to prison, and then roll a
bomb along Wall Street whose detonation would startle the financial
world clean out of its orbit!Stolz had failed to notice that Ames's
schemes had so signally worked out that C. and R. was practically in
his hands now!The defeated railroad magnate at length backed out of
the Ames office purple with rage.And then he pledged himself to
hypothecate his entire fortune to the rescue of his worthless nephew.Thus, in deep iniquity, was launched the famous trial, a process of
justice in name only, serving as an outlet for a single man's long
nurtured personal animosities.The adulterous union of religion and
business was only nominally before the bar.The victims, not the
defendant only, not the preachers, the washerwomen, the factory girls,
the widows, and the orphans, whose life savings Ketchim had drawn into
his net by the lure of pious benedictions, but rather those
unfortunates who had chanced to incur the malicious hatred of the
great, legalized malefactor, Ames, by opposition to his selfish
caprice, and whose utter defeat and discrediting before the public
would now place the crown of righteous expediency upon his own
chicanery and extortion and his wantonly murderous deeds.Doctor Jurges, utterly
confused by the keen lawyers, and vainly endeavoring to follow the
dictates of his conscience, while attempting to reconcile them with
his many talks with Darius Borwell, gave testimony which fell little
short of incriminating himself.For there were produced letters which
he had written to members of his congregation, and which for subtlety
and deception, though doubtless innocently done, would have made a
seasoned promoter look sharp to his own laurels.He had been summoned from Denver for the
trial.But his stuttering evidence gave no advantage to either side.And then--crowning blunder!--Cass permitted Ketchim himself to take
the stand.And the frightened, trembling broker gave his own cause
such a blow that the prosecution might well have asked the judge to
take the case from the jury then and there.It was a legal _faux pas_;
and Cass walked the floor and moaned the whole night through.Then, as per program, the prosecution called Madam Beaubien.Could not
that sorrowing woman have given testimony which would have aided the
tottering defense, and unmasked the evil genius which presided over
this mock trial?But not one point would the
judge sustain when it bordered upon forbidden territory.It was made
plain to her that she was there to testify against Ketchim, and to
permit the Ames lawyers to bandy her own name about the court room
upon the sharp points of their cruel cross-questions and low
insinuations.But, she protested, her knowledge of the Simiti company's affairs had
come through another person.Ames should give his own testimony--for was it not he who
had, not long since, legally punished the witness on a charge of
defamation of character?And the spectators
knew that it was because the righteous prosecution could no longer
stain its hands with one who bore such a tarnished name as she.And then, taunted and goaded to exasperation, the wronged woman burst
into tears and flayed the bigamist Ames there before the court room
crowded with eager society ladies and curious, non-toiling men.Flayed
him as men are seldom flayed and excoriated by the women they trample.The bailiffs seized her, and dragged her into an ante-room; the judge
broke his gavel rapping for order, and threatened to clear the court;
and then Cass, too young and inexperienced to avoid battle with
seasoned warriors, rose and demanded that Madam Beaubien be returned
to the stand.He turned to
the people, as if seeking their support.A great murmur arose through
the court room.That man, sitting calm
and unimpassioned, nodded his head slightly.And the woman was led
back to the chair."It may have an important bearing upon the case, Your Honor!"cried
the young lawyer for the defense.Ames is to take the stand as an
important witness in this case.If Madam Beaubien brings such a charge
against him, it gives us reason to believe his honor peccable, and his
testimony open to suspicion!"It was a daring statement, and the whole room gasped, and held its
breath."The
lawyer for the defense is in contempt of court!Madam Beaubien has
been shown to be a--"

"The objection is sustained!"_"His first wife's portrait--is in a glass window--in his yacht!"_
cried the hysterical Beaubien.Then she crumpled up in a limp mass,
and was led from the chair half fainting.At the woman's shrill words a white-haired man, dressed in black,
clerical garb, who had been sitting in the rear of the room close to
the door, rose hastily, then slowly sat down again.At his feet
reposed a satchel, bearing several foreign labels.Evidently he had
but just arrived from distant lands.Consternation reigned throughout the room for a few minutes.Then
Cass, believing that the psychological moment had arrived, loudly
called Carmen Ariza to the stand.The dramatic play must be continued,
now that it had begun.The battle which had raged back and forth for
long, weary days, could be won, if at all, only by playing upon the
emotions of the jury, for the evidence thus far given had resulted in
showing not only the defense, but likewise the Beaubien, and all who
had been associated with the Simiti company, including Cass himself,
to be participators in gross, intentional fraud.The remaining witness, the girl herself, had been purposely neglected
by the prosecution, for the great Ames had planned that she must be
called by the defense.Then would he bring up the prostitute, Jude,
and from her wring testimony which must blast forever the girl's
already soiled name.Following her, he would himself take the stand,
and tell of the girl's visits to his office; of her protestations of
love for him; of her embracing him; and of a thousand indiscretions
which he had carefully garnered and stored for this triumphant
occasion.But the judge, visibly perturbed by the dramatic turn which the case
seemed to be taking, studied his watch for a moment, then Ames's face,
and then abruptly adjourned court until the following day.Yet not
until Cass had been recognized, and the hounded girl summoned from her
cell in the Tombs, to take the stand in the morning for--her life!CHAPTER 17


In the days to come, when the divine leaven which is in the world
to-day shall have brought more of the carnal mind's iniquity to the
surface, that the Sun of Truth may destroy the foul germs, there shall
be old men and women, and they which, looking up from their work, peep
and mutter of strange things long gone, who shall fall wonderingly
silent when they have told again of the fair young girl who walked
alone into the crowded court room that cold winter's morning.And
their stories will vary with the telling, for no two might agree what
manner of being it was that came into their midst that day.Even the bailiffs, as if moved by some strange prescience, had fallen
back and allowed her to enter alone.The buzz of subdued chatter
ceased, and a great silence came over all as they looked.Some swore,
in awed whispers, when the dramatic day had ended, and judge and jury
and wrangling lawyer had silently, and with bowed heads, gone quiet
and thoughtful each to his home, that a nimbus encircled her beautiful
head when she came through the door and faced the gaping multitude.Some said that her eyes were raised; that she saw not earthly things;
and that a heavenly presence moved beside her.Nor may we lightly set
aside these tales; for, after the curtain had fallen upon the
wonderful scene about to be enacted, there was not one present who
would deny that, as the girl came into the great room and went
directly to the witness chair, God himself walked at her side and held
her hand."Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou
dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou
goest."Through the mind of that same white-haired man in the clerical garb
ran these words as he watched the girl move silently across the room.She seemed to have taken on a new meaning to him since the previous
day.And as he looked, his eyes grew moist, and he drew out his
handkerchief.But his were not the only eyes that had filled then.Hitt and Haynerd
bent their heads, that the people might not see; Miss Wall and the
Beaubien wept silently, and with no attempt to stay their grief; Jude
buried her head in her hands, and rocked back and forth, moaning
softly.A welter of conflicting emotions
surged through their harassed souls.They seemed to have come now to
the great crisis.And which way the tide would turn rested with this
lone girl.For some moments after she was seated the silence remained unbroken.And as she sat there, waiting, she looked down at the man who sought
to destroy what he might not possess.Some said afterward that as she
looked at him she smiled.Who knows but that the Christ himself smiled
down from the cross at those who had riven his great heart?He was far
from well that morning, and an ugly, murderous mood possessed him.And
yet, judged by the world's standards, he had tipped the crest of
success.He was swollen
with wealth, with material power, with abnormal pride.His tender
sensibilities and sympathies were happily completely ossified, and he
was stone deaf and blind to the agonies of a suffering world.Not a
single aim but had been realized; not a lone ambition but had been
met.Even the armed camp at Avon, and the little wooden crosses over
the fresh mounds there, all testified to his omnipotence; and in them,
despite their horrors, he felt a satisfying sense of his own great
might.The clerk held up the Bible for the girl to give her oath.She looked
at him for a moment, and then smiled."I will tell the truth," she
said simply.The officer hesitated, and looked up at the judge.But the latter sat
with his eyes fixed upon the girl.The clerk did not press the point;
and Carmen was delivered into the hands of the lawyers.Then, yielding to a sudden
impulse, he asked the girl to mention briefly the place of her birth,
her parentage, and other statistical data, leading up to her
association with the defendant.It was but the one she had
told again and again.And when
she had concluded, Cass turned her back again to Simiti, and to
Rosendo's share in the mining project which had ultimated in this
suit.A far-away look came into the girl's eyes as she spoke of that great,
black man who had taken her from desolate Badillo into his own warm
heart.There were few dry eyes among the spectators when she told of
his selfless love.And when she drew the portrait of him, standing
alone in the cold mountain water, far up in the jungle of Guamoco,
bending over the laden _batea_, and toiling day by day in those
ghastly solitudes, that she might be protected and educated and raised
above her primitive environment in Simiti, there were sobs heard
throughout the room; and even the judge, hardened though he was by
conflict with the human mind, removed his glasses and loudly cleared
his throat as he wiped them.Ames first grew weary as he listened, and then exasperated.His lawyer
at length rose to object to the recital on the ground that it was
largely irrelevant to the case.And the judge, pulling himself
together, sustained the objection.Then the prosecution
eagerly took up the cross-examination."Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
bring forth," murmured the white-haired man in the clerical garb far
back in the crowded room.Had he learned the law of Truth to error,
"Thou shall surely die"?Did he discern the vultures gnawing at the
rich man's vitals?Did he, too, know that this giant of privilege, so
insolently flaunting his fleeting power, his blood-stained wealth and
his mortal pride, might as well seek to dim the sun in heaven as to
escape the working of those infinite divine laws which shall effect
the destruction of evil and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven
even here upon earth?The latter drew Ellis down and
transmitted his master's instructions.The atmosphere grew tense, and
the hush of expectancy lay over all."Miss Carmen," began Ellis easily, "your parentage has been a matter
of some dispute, if I mistake not, and--"

Cass was on his feet to object.What had this question to do with the
issue?Cass should have divined it by this time.Ellis cleared his throat and adjusted his glasses."And your
father, it is said, was a <DW64> priest.I believe that has been
accepted for some time."I never knew my earthly father," replied Carmen in a low voice."But you have admitted that it might have been this Diego, have you
not?""It might have been," returned the girl, looking off absently toward
the high windows."Did he not claim you as his daughter?""Now," continued Ellis, "that being reasonably settled, is it not also
true that you used the claim of possessing this mine, La Libertad, as
a pretext for admission to society here in New York?"The girl did not answer, but only smiled pityingly at him.He, too,
had bartered his soul; and in her heart there rose a great sympathy
for him in his awful mesmerism."And that you claimed to be an Inca princess?"admonished the judge, looking severely down upon the silent
girl.Carmen sighed, and drew her gaze away from the windows.She was weary,
oh, so weary of this unspeakable mockery.And yet she was there to
prove her God."I would like to ask this further question," Ellis resumed, without
waiting for her reply."Were you not at one time in a resort conducted
by Madam Cazeau, down on--"

He stopped short.The girl's eyes were looking straight into his, and
they seemed to have pierced his soul."I am sorry for you," she said
gently, "oh, so sorry!The man knew not whether to smile in triumph or hide his head in
shame.Ames alone
met his embarrassed glance, and sent back a command to continue the
attack.What possible relation to the
issue involved could such testimony have?But the judge bade him sit
down, as the counsel for the prosecution doubtless was bringing out
facts of greatest importance.Ellis again cleared his throat and bent to his loathsome task."Now,
Miss Ariza, in reference to your labors to incite the mill hands at
Avon to deeds of violence, the public considers that as part of a
consistent line of attack upon Mr.Ames, in which you were aiding
others from whom you took your orders.May I ask you to cite the
motives upon which you acted?"Ames," she slowly replied, "but only the
things he stands for."A militant brand of social uplift, I
suppose?"And that is the sort of remedy that anarchists apply to
industrial troubles, is it not?""There is no remedy for industrial troubles but Christianity," she
said gently."Not the burlesque Christianity of our countless sects
and churches; not Roman Catholicism; not Protestantism; nor any of the
fads and fancies of the human mind; but just the Christianity of Jesus
of Nazareth, who knew that the human man was not God's image, but only
stood for it in the mortal consciousness.And he always saw behind
this counterfeit the real man, the true likeness of God.And--"

"You are diverging from the subject proper and consuming time, Miss
Ariza!"Carmen did not heed him, but continued quietly:

"And it was just such a man that Jesus portrayed in his daily walk and
words.""No," the girl went calmly on, "Jesus did not stand for the
intolerance, the ignorance, the bigotry, the hatred, and the human
hypothesis, the fraud, and chicanery, and the 'Who shall be greatest?'Nor did he make evil a reality, as mortals do.He knew it seemed awfully real to the deceived human consciousness;
but he told that consciousness to be not afraid.And then he went to
work and drove out the belief of evil on the basis of its nothingness
and its total lack of principle.The orthodox churches and sects of
to-day do not do that.Their
kingdom is wholly temporal, and is upheld by heartless millionaires,
and by warlike kings and emperors.Their tenets shame the intelligence
of thinking men!Yet they have slain tens of millions to establish
them!"To remove the girl meant depriving Ames of
his prey.But if she remained upon the stand, she would put them all
to confusion, for they had no means of silencing her.The judge looked
blankly at Ames; his hands were tied.Ellis hurried to change the current of her talk by interposing another
question."Will you tell us, Miss Carmen, why you have been working--"

"I have been working for God," she interrupted.Her voice was low and
steady, and her eyes shone with a light that men are not wont to see
in those of their neighbors.And for Him I am here to-day."Consternation was plainly discernible in the camp of the prosecution.Cass knew now that he need make no more objections.The defense had
passed from his hands.At this juncture James Ketchim, brother of the defendant, thinking to
relieve the strain and embarrassment, gave audible voice to one of his
wonted witticisms.But the effect was not
what he had anticipated.roared the exasperated judge, bending
far over his desk.And the elder
Ketchim retired in chagrin and confusion."Miss Carmen," pursued Ellis, eager to recover his advantage, for he
saw significant movements among the jury, "do you not think the
unfortunate results at Avon quite prove that you have allied yourself
with those who oppose the nation's industrial progress?"Order had now been restored in the court room, and
Ellis was feeling sure of himself again."You have opposed the constructive development of our country's
resources by your assaults upon men of wealth, like Mr.Ames, for
example, have you not?"Then the girl opened her mouth, and from it came words that fell upon
the room like masses of lead."I stand opposed to any man, Mr.Ellis,
who, to enrich himself, and for the purpose of revenge, spreads the
boll weevil in the cotton fields of the South."And yet it was a silence that
fell crashing upon Ames's straining ears.He sat for a moment stunned;
then sprang to his feet.He held out a
hand, and made as if to speak; then sank again into his chair.Ellis collected himself, and turned to the judge."Your Honor, we regret to state that, from the replies which Miss
Ariza has given, we do not consider her mentally competent as a
witness."I should
like to examine the witness further!"returned the judge, glowering over his spectacles
at the young lawyer."I stand on--"

"Sit down!"called Cass through the rising tumult, "the lawyer for
the prosecution has heaped insults upon you in his low references to
your parentage.Will you--"

The judge pounded upon his desk with the remnant of his broken gavel.he called in a loud, threatening
voice.The judge sat down and mopped his steaming face.Ames was a study of
wild, infuriated passion.Carmen
sat quietly facing the crowded room.She had reached up and was
fondling the little locket which hung at her throat.It was the first
time she had ever worn it.It was not a pretty piece of jewelry; and
it had never occurred to her to wear it until that day.Nor would she
have thought of it then, had not the Beaubien brought it to the Tombs
the night before in a little box with some papers which the girl had
called for.Why she had put it on, she could not say.Slowly, while the silence continued unbroken, the girl drew the
slender chain around in front of her and unclasped it."I--I never--knew my parents," she murmured musingly, looking down
lovingly at the little locket.Then she opened it and sat gazing, rapt
and absorbed, at the two little portraits within."But there are their
pictures," she suddenly announced, holding the locket out to Cass.It was said afterward that never in the history of legal procedure in
New York had that court room held such dead silence as when Cass stood
bending over the faces of the girl's earthly parents, portrayed in the
strange little locket which Rosendo had taken from Badillo years
before.Never had it known such a tense moment; never had the very air
itself seemed so filled with a mighty, unseen presence, as on that day
and in that crisal hour.Without speaking, Hood rose and looked over Cass's shoulder at the
locket.A muffled cry escaped him, and he turned and stared at Ames."Yes, sir," replied Hood in a voice that was scarcely heard.Hood seemed to have frozen to the spot.His hands shook, and his words
gibbered from his trembling lips."The--the woman's portrait, sir--is--is--the one in--in Mr."_

The piercing cry rang through the still room like a lost soul's
despairing wail.Ames had rushed from his seat, overturning his chair,
thrusting the lawyers aside, and seized the locket.For a moment he
peered wildly into it.It seemed as if his eyes would devour it,
absorb it, push themselves clean through it, in their eagerness to
grasp its meaning.His eyes were red; his face ashen; his lips white.His unsteady glance met the girl's.His mouth opened, and flapped like
a broken shutter in the wind.His arms swung wildly upward; then
dropped heavily.Suddenly he bent to one side; caught himself;
straightened up; and then, with a horrifying, gurgling moan, crashed
to the floor.The noise of the tremendous fall reverberated through
the great room like an echo of Satan's plunge into the pit of hell.They rushed forward in a mass, over railings, over chairs
and tables, heedless of all but the great mystery that was slowly
clearing away in the dim light that winter's morning.Through them the
white-haired man, clad in clerical vestments, elbowed his way to the
bar.He tore it from Hood's hand and scanned it eagerly.he murmured, trembling with
excitement.Then, shouting to the judge above the hubbub:

"Your Honor!called the judge in a loud, quavering voice.The woman's
portrait in this little locket is that of Dona Dolores, Infanta,
daughter of Queen Isabella the Second, of Spain!And this girl,"
pointing to the bewildered Carmen, who sat clinging to the arms of her
chair, "is her child, and is a princess of the royal blood!Her father
is the man who lies there--J. Wilton Ames!"CHAPTER 18


Borne on pulsing electric waves, the news of the great _denouement_
flashed over the city, and across a startled continent.Beneath the
seas it sped, and into court and hovel.Madrid gasped; Seville panted;
and old Padre Rafael de Rincon raised his hoary head and cackled
shrilly.To the seething court room came flying reporters and news gatherers,
who threw themselves despairingly against the closed portals.Within,
the bailiffs fought with the excited crowd, and held the doors against
the panic without.Over the prostrate form of Ames the physicians worked with feverish
energy, but shook their heads.In the adjoining ante-room, whither she had been half carried, half
dragged by Hitt when Ames fell, sat Carmen, clasped in the Beaubien's
arms, stunned, bewildered, and speechless.Hitt stood guard at the
door; and Miss Wall and Jude tiptoed about with bated breath, unable
to take their eyes from the girl.In the court room without, Haynerd held the little locket, and plied
Monsignor Lafelle with his incoherent questions.The excited editor's
brain was afire; but of one thing he was well assured, the Express
would bring out an extra that night that would scoop its rivals clean
to the bone!In a few minutes the bailiffs fought the mob back from the doors and
admitted a man, a photographer, who had been sent out to procure
chemicals in the hope that the portrait of the man in the locket might
be cleaned.Ten minutes later the features of J. Wilton Ames stood
forth clearly beside those of the wife of his youth.The picture
showed him younger in appearance, to be sure, but the likeness was
unmistakable.Monsignor, but you are slow!wailed Haynerd, shaking the
churchman's arm in his excitement."I saw the portrait in the Royal
Gallery, years ago, in Madrid.I could not forget the
sad, sweet face.I saw it again in the stained-glass window in the
Ames yacht.There was much whispering, much shaking of heads, but little
information.But this I know: the queen, the great Isabella, had a
lover, a wonderful tenor, Marfori, Marquis de Loja.And one day a babe
was taken quietly to a little cottage in the Granada hills.Rumor said
that it was an Infanta, and that the tenor was its father.One man, perhaps: old Rafael de Rincon.But Rome suddenly recalled
him from Isabella's court, and after that he was very quiet."Ames," he said, "traveled much in
Europe.He bought a vineyard in Granada--the
one from which he still procures his wine.And there--who knows?--he
met the Infanta.But probably neither he nor she guessed her royal
birth.""Well, they eloped--who knows?Whether married or not, I can not say.But it is evident she went with him to Colombia, where, perhaps, he
was seeking a concession from Congress in Bogota.Then came the news of his father's sudden death.Possibly he bade her wait for his return.But a
prospective mother is often excitable.She waited a day, a week--who
knows how long?she was wild
to do such a thing.She died at the little
riverine town of Badillo, after her babe, Carmen, was born."A heritage from her grandfather, the tenor, Marfori," Lafelle
suggested."But--the portraits--what is the name under that of Ames?"Yes, for Guillermo in Spanish is William.Doubtless Ames told her his
name was Will, contracted from Wilton, the name he went by in his
youth.And the nearest the Spanish could come to it was Guillermo.Diego's name was Guillermo Diego Polo.And after he had seen that name
in the locket he used it as a further means of strengthening his claim
upon the girl.""Then--she is--a--princess!""Yes, doubtless, if my reasoning is correct.Not an Inca princess, but
a princess of the reigning house of Spain."Haynerd could hold himself no longer, but rushed madly from the room
and tore across town to the office of the Express.Then came the white-enameled ambulance, dashing and careening to the
doors of the building where Ames lay so quiet.Gently, silently, the
great body was lifted and borne below.And then the chattering,
gesticulating mob poured from the court room, from the halls and
corridors, and out into the chill sunlight of the streets, where they
formed anew into little groups, and went over again the dramatic
events but a few minutes past.Then, too, emerged Carmen, heavily veiled from the curious, vulgar
gaze of the rabble, and entered the waiting limousine, with the
Beaubien and Hitt.Miss Wall and the gasping Jude followed in another.The judge had bidden the girl go on her own recognizance.The arrest
at Avon; the matter of bail; all had merged into the excitement of the
hour and been forgotten.Ketchim went out on Cass's arm.The judge had
ordered the clerk to enter an adjournment.*       *       *       *       *

All that afternoon and far into the night a gaping, wondering
concourse braved the cold and stood about the walk that led up to the
little Beaubien cottage.Within, the curtains were drawn, and Sidney,
Jude, and Miss Wall answered the calls that came incessantly over the
telephone and to the doors.Sidney had not been in the court room, for
Haynerd had left him at the editor's desk in his own absence.But with
the return of Haynerd the lad had hurried into a taxicab and commanded
the chauffeur to drive madly to the Beaubien home.And once through
the door, he clasped the beautiful girl in his arms and strained her
to his breast."My own, my very own little sister!We only
pretended before, didn't we?But now--now, oh, God above!The scarce comprehending girl drew his head down and kissed him."Sidney," she murmured, "the ways of God are past finding out!"Aye, for again, as of old, He had chosen the foolish things of the
world to confound the wise; He had chosen the weak to confound the
mighty; and the base things, and the things despised, had He used to
bring to naught the things that are.That no flesh might
glory in His terrible presence!The girl smiled up at him; then turned away.she kept repeating, groping her way about
the room as if in a haze.The still dazed Beaubien drew the girl into her arms.Yet I
called you that from the very first.And he--that
man--your father!"It--"

Then the Beaubien's heart almost stopped.What,
then, would this sudden turn in the girl's life mean to the lone woman
who clung to her so?"No, mother dearest," whispered Carmen, looking up through her tears."For even if it should be true, I will not leave you.He--he--"

She stopped; and would speak of him no more.But neither of them knew as yet that in that marvelous Fifth Avenue
palace, behind those drawn curtains and guarded bronze doors, at which
an eager crowd stood staring, Ames, the superman, lay dying, his left
side, from the shoulder down, paralyzed.*       *       *       *       *

In the holy quiet of the first hours of morning, the mist rose, and
the fallen man roused slowly out of his deep stupor.And then through
the dim-lit halls of the great mansion rang a piercing cry.For when
he awoke, the curtain stood raised upon his life; and the sight of its
ghastly content struck wild terror to his naked soul.He had dreamed as he lay there, dreamed while the mist was rising.He
thought he had been toiling with feverish energy through those black
hours, building a wall about the things that were his.And into the
design of the huge structure he had fitted the trophies of his
conquest.Gannette toiled with him, straining, sweating, groaning.Together they reared that monstrous wall; and as they labored, the man
plotted the death of his companion when the work should be done, lest
he ask for pay.And into the corners of the wall they fitted little
skulls.These were the children of Avon who had never played.And over
the great stones which they heaved into place they sketched red
dollar-marks; and their paint was human blood.A soft wind swept over
the rising structure, and it bore a gentle voice: "I am Love."But the
toilers looked up and cursed.And over the rim of the wall looked fair faces."We are
Truth, we are Life!"But the men frothed with fury, and hurled skulls
at the faces, and bade them begone!A youth and a tender girl looked
down at the sweating toilers."We ask help; we are young, and times
are so hard!"And then the darkness settled down,
for the wall was now so high that it shut out the sun.And the great
man howled with laughter; the wall was done.So he turned and smote
his companion unto death, and dipped his hands in the warm blood of
the quivering corpse.And then he sought to
mount the wall.But his hands slipped on the human blood of the red,
slimy dollar-marks, and he fell crashing back among his tinkling
treasures.The naked, splitting skulls
leered at him.The toothless jaws clattered, and the eyeless sockets
glowed eerily.He begged that a rope be
lowered.He would go out once more into the sunlit world.But the
chill wind brought him only despairing moans.Then he rushed madly to the wall, and smote it with his bare hands.It
mocked him with the strength which he had given it.He turned and tore
his hair and flesh.He gnashed his teeth until they broke into bits.He cursed; he raved; he pleaded; he offered all his great treasure for
freedom.But the skulls grinned their horrid mockery at him; and the
blood on the stones dripped upon his burning head.And above it all he
heard the low plotting of those without who were awaiting his death,
that they might throw down the wall and take away his treasure.And then his fear became frenzy; his love of gold turned to horror;
his reason fled; and he dashed himself wildly against the prison which
he had reared, until he fell, bleeding and broken.And as he fell, he
heard the shrill cackle of demons that danced their hellish steps on
the top of the wall.Then the Furies flew down and bound him tight."Ah, my God, What might I not have made of Thy fair world Had I
  but loved Thy highest creature here?It was my duty to have loved
  the highest; It surely was my profit had I known."Then he
sought to raise his arms, to move.And then the scream
tore from his dry throat.The physicians bent over him and
sought to soothe his mental agony.The man's torture was fearful to
behold; his weakness, pitiable.But the
sleep was one of unbroken horror; and those in the room stopped in the
course of their duties; and their faces blanched; and they held their
hands to their ears, when his awful moans echoed through the curtained
room.Through his dreams raced the endless panorama of his crowded life.Now
he was wading through muddy slums where stood the wretched houses
which he rented for immoral purposes.And then he hurried to Avon; and there he dug into those fresh
graves--dug, dug, dug, throwing the dirt up in great heaps behind him.And into the face of each corpse as he dragged it out of its damp bed
he peered eagerly.But with awful moans he threw them from him in
turn, for she was not there.Then he fled down, down, far into the burning South; and there he
roamed the trackless wastes, calling her name.And the wild beasts and
the hissing serpents looked out at him from the thick bush, looked
with great, red eyes, and then fled from him with loathing.And,
suddenly, he came upon another mound near the banks of a great river.And over it stood a rude cross; and on the cross he read the dim,
penciled word, _Dolores_.how he cried out for the oblivion
that was not his.But the ghastly mound froze his blood, and he rushed
from it in terror, and fell, whirling over and over, down, down into
eternal blackness filled with dying men's groans!The exhausted attendants stood about
the bed with bated breath.The physicians had called Doctor Morton in
consultation, for the latter was a brain specialist.And while they
sat gazing at the crazed, stricken giant, hopelessly struggling to
lift the inert mass of his dead body, Reverend Darius Borwell entered.He bowed silently to them all; then went to the bedside and took the
patient's hand.A moment later he turned to the physicians and
nurses."Let us ask God's help for Mr.They bowed, and he knelt beside the bed and prayed long and earnestly;
prayed that the loving Father who had made man in His image would take
pity on the suffering one who lay there, and, if it be His will, spare
him for Jesus' sake.He arose from his knees, and they all sat quiet for some moments.Then
Doctor Morton's heavy voice broke the silence of death.Borwell,"
he said in awful earnestness, extending his hand toward the bed, "cure
that man, if your religion is anything more than a name!"A hot flush of indignation spread over the minister's face; but he did
not reply."Gentlemen," he said solemnly, "Mr.Ames, I think, is past our aid.There is nothing on earth that can save him.If he lives, he will be
hopelessly insane.""Upstairs, sir, in her apartments," answered the maid, wiping her red
eyes."See that she remains there," said the doctor gruffly."Gentlemen,"
turning again to the physicians, "I have but one suggestion.Send
for--for--that little girl, Carmen.""It is ill-advised, Doctor," interrupted one of the men."It would
only further excite him."I do not agree with you," returned Doctor Morton."As it is, he is
doomed.With her here--there may be a chance."The others shook their heads; but Doctor Morton persisted stubbornly."If she is sent for, I shall
retire from the case.""Very well," announced Doctor Morton evenly, "then I will take it
myself."He rose and went out into the vestibule where there was a
telephone.Calling for the Beaubien cottage, he gave a peremptory
order that Carmen come at once in the automobile which he was sending
for her.The Beaubien turned from the telephone to the girl."Why--is it--is he--"

"They say he is--dying," the woman whispered.Carmen stood for a minute as if stunned."Why--I--didn't know--that
there was--anything wrong.The Beaubien threw her arms around the girl.Father Waite rose from
the table where he had been writing, and came to them.A few minutes later the great bronze doors of the Ames mansion swung
wide to admit the daughter of the house.Doctor Morton met the wondering girl, and led her directly into the
sick-room."Miss Carmen," he said gravely, "Mr.The girl turned upon him like a flash from a clear sky."You mean, he
_shall_ not live!"Then a sense of her
magnificent environment, of her strange position, and of the vivid
events of the past few hours swept over her, and she became
embarrassed.The nurses and attendants, too, who stood about and
stared so hard at her, added to her confusion."Listen," he said, "I am leaving now,
but you will remain.If I am needed, one of the maids will summon
me."Carmen stood for a moment without speaking.Then she walked slowly to
the bed and looked down at the man.Doctor Morton motioned to the
attendants to withdraw.Then he himself stepped softly out and closed
the door.When the girl turned around, she was alone--with death.CHAPTER 19


A curious, gossiping world, dwelling only in the froth of the human
mind, will not comprehend for many a year to come what took place in
that dim, tapestried chamber of the rich man in those next hours.When
twilight began to steal through the marble halls of the great,
shrouded mansion, the nurse in charge, becoming apprehensive, softly
opened the door of the sick-room and peeped in.Through the darkness
she saw the girl, sitting beside the bed, with the man's right hand
clasped in both of hers, and her head resting upon his shoulder.And
the nurse quickly closed the door again in awe, and stole away.The girl sat there all that day and all that night, nor would leave
but for brief moments to eat, or to reassure the Beaubien over the
telephone that all was well.Doctor Morton came, and went, and came
again.Carmen smiled, and held his hand for a moment each time, but
said little.And, more, his cheeks were stained where
the scalding tears had coursed down them.But the doctor would ask no
questions.And three days and nights passed thus, while Carmen dwelt with the man
who, as the incarnation of error, seeking the destruction of others,
had destroyed himself.Then Doctor Morton announced to a waiting world that his patient would
live--but he would say no more.And the world heard, too, that
Kathleen Ames had left her father's roof--left in humiliation and
chagrin when she learned that Carmen had come there to live--and had
gone to England for a prolonged visit with the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her now thoroughly dismayed son.But Sidney came; and with
him the black-veiled Beaubien.And they both knelt beside the bed of
suffering; and the hand of the now quiet man slowly went out and lay
for a moment upon their bowed heads, while Carmen stood near.Then
Willett was sent for; and he came often after that, and took his
master's scarce audible instructions, and went away again to touch the
wires and keys that ended the war of hatred at Avon; that brought
Father Danny in the master's private car to the great metropolitan
hospital; that sent to the startled Hitt the canceled mortgage papers
on the Express; and that inaugurated that great work of restitution
which held the dwellers in the Ames mansion toiling over musty books
and forgotten records for months to come.What had passed between the man and the sweet-faced girl who hovered
over him like a ray of light, no one may know.That he had trod the
glowing embers of hell, his cavernous, deep-lined face and whitening
hair well testified.It was said afterward that on that third day he
had opened his eyes and looked straight into those of the girl.It was
said that she then whispered but one word, "Father."And that, when
the sound of her low voice fell upon his straining ears, he had
reached out the arm that still held life, and had drawn her head down
upon his breast, and wept like a motherless babe.But what he had
said, if aught, about the abandoned mother who, on the banks of the
distant river, years gone, had yielded her life to him and his child,
no one knew.Of but one thing was there any certainty: the name of
Padre Jose de Rincon had not crossed their lips during those dark
days.Then strong men lifted the giant from his bed
and placed him in a wheel chair; and Carmen drew the chair out into
the conservatory, among the ferns and flowers, and sat beside him, his
hand still clasped in both of hers.That he had found life, no one who
marked his tense, eager look, which in every waking moment lay upon
the girl, could deny.His body was dead; his soul was fluttering
feebly into a new sense of being.But with the awakening of conscience, in the birth-throes of a new
life, came the horrors, the tortures, the wild frenzy of self-loathing;
and, but for the girl who clung so desperately to him, he would have
quickly ended his useless existence.The stage upon which the curtain had risen,
whereon he saw the hourly portrayal of his own fiendish deeds, stood
always before him like a haunting spectre; and as he gazed with
horrified eyes, his hair grew hourly white.And the torture was rendered more poignant by the demands of his
erstwhile associates and henchmen.They had taken fright at the first
orders which had issued from the sick-bed, but now they swooped down
upon the harassed man to learn what might be expected from him in the
future.What were to be his policies now in regard to those manifold
interests which he was pursuing with such vigor a few weeks ago?Was
he still bent upon depriving Senator Gossitch of the seat which the
Ames money had purchased?The
Amalgamated Spinners' Association must know at once his further plans.His great railroad projects, his
mining ventures, his cotton deals, his speculations and gambling
schemes--whither should they tend now?Ward bosses, dive keepers,
bank presidents, lawyers, magnates, and preachers clamored for
admission at his doors when they learned that he would live, but that
a marvelous, incomprehensible change had swept over him.The tired, hectored man turned to Carmen.And she called Hitt and
Waite and the keen-minded Beaubien.The latter's wide business
experience and worldly knowledge now stood them all in good stead, and
she threw herself like a bulwark between the stricken man and the
hounds that roared at his gates.There were those among them who, like
Ames, had bitterly fought all efforts at industrial and social reform,
and yet who saw the dawning of a new era in the realms of finance, of
politics, of religion.There were those who sensed the slow awakening
of the world-conscience, and who resisted it desperately, and who now
sat frightened and angered at the thought of losing their great
leader.Their attitude toward life, like his, had been wrong from the
beginning; they, like him, were striking examples of the dire effects
of a false viewpoint in the impoverishing of human life.But, with
him, they had built up a tremendous material fabric.And now they
shook with fear as they saw its chief support removed.For they must
know that his was a type that was fast passing, and after it must come
the complete breakdown of the old financial order.His world-embracing
gambling--which touched all men in some way, for it had to do with the
very necessities of life, with crops, with railroads, with industries,
and out of which he had coined untold millions--had ceased forever.And to him also came Reverend Darius Borwell, in whose congregation
sat sanctimonious malefactors of vast wealth, whose pockets bulged
with disease-laden profits from the sales of women's bodies and souls.Reverend Borwell came to offer the sufferer the dubious consolations
of religion--and inquire if his beautiful change of heart would affect
the benefaction which he had designed for the new church.Ah, this was the hour when the fallen giant faced the Apostle's awful
question: What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed?_For the end of those things is death!_

And then came Monsignor Lafelle, asking not to see the sick man, but
the girl.And, alone with her in the great library that day, he bent
low over her hand and begged that she would forgive and forget.Ames that flagrantly false tale of the girl's
parentage.He had received it from Wenceslas, in Cartagena.It was he
who, surmising the dark secret of Ames, had concluded that the
supposed Infanta had been his wife.And he had returned to New York
to confront him with the charge, and to make great capital out of it.But he had never suspected for a moment Carmen's connection with the
mystery.And now--

But the girl saw only the image of God in the humiliated man.And when
he kissed her hand and departed, she bade him know, always, that she
loved him as a brother.And he knew it, knew that her love was of the
spirit--it left all for the Christ.A few days later there was delivered at the Ames mansion a cable
message from Cartagena, in reply to one which the master had sent to
the lawyer, Estrella.Ames shook with suppressed excitement when he
read it.Then he bade Carmen send at once for Hitt, Willett, and
Captain McCall, and leave them with him for a private conference.Ames repeated, as the three
men sat leaning eagerly forward an hour later, drinking in every word
he spoke."If the mission is successful, well and good.If it fails,
then our silence now will be justified, for as yet I have said nothing
to her regarding him.Wenceslas has
won--but with--but of that later.When can you get under way,
McCall?"The sudden flash of his old-time energy nearly startled them
from their chairs."And," he added, "you, Mr.Now, Willett, have the door of my limousine widened to accommodate
this wheel chair.I want a dozen men to insure our privacy, and to
keep the way clear.No one not in our confidence must see us depart.""But--Carmen--"

"Goes with us," returned Ames."I can not spare her for a moment.Madam Beaubien will have charge of the house during our absence.We
will be back here, weather favorable, in three weeks--or not at all!""Yet, she will know--"

"Nothing.I take the trip, ostensibly, for the change; to get away
from those who are hounding me here; for recuperation--anything!The man's eyes glistened like live coals, and
his sunken cheeks took on a feverish glow.That night the _Cossack_, enveloped in gloom, steamed noiselessly out
of New York harbor, and turned her prow to the South.And when she
had entered the high sea, Captain McCall from his bridge aloft sent a
message down to the waiting engineer:

"Full speed ahead!"CHAPTER 20


Cartagena's slumber of centuries had been broken by nearly four years
of civil warfare.But on the day that the lookout in the abandoned
convent of Santa Candelaria, on the summit of La Popa, flashed the
message down into the old city that a steam yacht had appeared on the
northern horizon, she was preparing to sink back again into quiet
dreams.For peace was being concluded among the warring political
factions.The country lay devastated and blood-soaked; but the cause
of Christ had triumphed, and the Church still sat supreme in the
councils of Bogota.Cartagena was _en fete_; the last of the political
agitators would be executed on the morrow.And so the lookout's
message was received with indifference, even though he embellished it
with the comment that the boat must be privately owned, as no ships of
the regular lines were due to arrive that day.Quietly the graceful craft swept down past Tierra Bomba and into the
Boca Chica, between the ancient forts of San Fernando and San Jose,
and came to anchor out in the beautiful harbor, a half mile from the
ancient gate of the clock.A few curious idlers along the shore
watched it and commented on its perfect lines.And the numerous
officials of the port lazily craned their necks at it, and yawningly
awaited the arrival of the skiff that was immediately lowered and
headed for the pier.The tall American who stepped from the little boat and came at once to
them to show his papers, easily satisfied their curiosity, for many
tourists of the millionaire class dropped anchor in Cartagena's
wonderful harbor, and came ashore to wander among the decaying
mementos of her glorious past.And this boat was not a stranger to
these waters.On the yacht itself, as they glanced again toward it,
there was no sign of life.Even the diminishing volume of smoke that
rose from its funnels evidenced the owner's intention of spending some
time in that romantic spot.From the dock, Hitt passed through the old gateway in the massive
wall, quickly crossed the _Plaza de Coches_, and lost himself in the
gay throngs that were entering upon the day's festivities.Occasionally he dropped into wine shops and little stores, and
lingered about to catch stray bits of gossip.Then he slowly made his
way up past the Cathedral and into the _Plaza de Simon Bolivar_.For a while, sitting on a bench in front of the equestrian statue of
the famous _Libertador_, he watched the passing crowds.From time to
time his glance strayed over toward the Cathedral.Once he rose, and
started in that direction; then came back and resumed his seat.It was
evident that he was driven hard, and yet knew not just what course to
pursue.Finally he jumped to his feet and went over to a little cigar store
which had caught his eye.He bent over the soiled glass case and
selected several cigars from the shabby stock.Putting one of them
into his mouth, he lighted it, and then casually nodded to a
powerfully built man standing near.The latter turned to the proprietor and made some comment in Spanish.Hitt immediately replied to it in the same tongue.The man flushed
with embarrassment; then doffed his hat and offered an apology."I
forget, senor," he said, "that so many Americans speak our language."Hitt held out his hand and laughed heartily at the incident.Then his
eye was attracted by a chain which the man wore."_Cierto_, _senor_," returned the man cordially."It came from an
Indian grave up in Guamoco.I am a _guaquero_--grave digger--by
profession; Jorge Costal, by name."Somehow he seemed to be familiar with that
name.Somewhere he seemed to have heard it."Suppose," he said, in his excellent Spanish, "that we cross
the _Plaza_ to yonder wine shop.You may be able to tell me some of
the history of this interesting old town.And--it would be a great
favor, senor."The man bowed courteously and accepted the invitation.A few moments
later they sat at a little table, with a bottle between them,
commenting on the animated scene in the street without."Peace will be concluded to-day, they say," reflected Hitt, by way of
introduction."Yes," returned the man grimly, "there is but little more blood to
let."The other is--"

He stopped and eyed Hitt furtively.But the American manifested only a
casual interest."They were posted this morning," said the man."Amado Jesus Fanor and
Jose de Rincon.""A liberal general and an ex-priest."It is the custom to--to shoot ex-priests down
here, eh?"But this man--senor, why do you ask?""Well--it struck me as curious--that's all," returned Hitt, at a loss
for a suitable answer."You didn't happen to know these men, I
presume?""_Na_, _senor_, you seek to involve me.Who are you, that you ask such
questions of a stranger?"The man reflected the suspicious caution of
these troublous times."Why, _amigo_, it is of no concern to me," replied Hitt easily,
flicking the ashes from his cigar."I once knew a fellow by that name.Learned that he afterward went to Simiti.But
I--"

"Senor!""Are you the _Americano_, the man
who explored?""I am," said Hitt, bending closer to him."And we are well met, for
you are Don Jorge, who knew Padre Jose de Rincon in Simiti, no?"The man cast a timid glance around the room."Senor," he whispered,
"we must not say these things here!I leave you now--"

"Not yet!"He was first three years in the prison in Cartagena.But the Bish--"

"Eh?Don Wenceslas had him removed to San Fernando?""And--"

"He will be shot to-morrow, senor.""Why do you
say he is an ex-priest?""He has just been excommunicated," replied the man."Cursed, they say,
by bell, book, and candle."Of course Don Wenceslas would not dare to execute a priest in
good standing.And so he had him excommunicated, eh?""_Quien sabe?_" he muttered.Hitt sat for a while in a deep study.And yet it
was flying like the winds."You knew a little girl--in Simiti--in whom this Rincon was
interested?"She went to the great States
from which you come.And I think little was heard from her after
that."She lived with--"

"Don Rosendo Ariza.""Dead--he and his good wife, Dona Maria.""Come," he said, "we will stroll down by the walls.I would
like a look at San Fernando."Senor, you--you--"

Hitt threw him a look of caution, and shook his head.Then, motioning
him to follow, he led him out and down through the winding, tortuous
thoroughfares.On the summit of the walls were sentinels, posted at
frequent intervals; and no civilian might walk upon the great
enclosure until peace had been formally declared.Hailing a passing carriage, Hitt urged the wondering Don Jorge into
it, and bade the driver convey them to the old ruin of San Felipe, and
leave them.There they climbed the broken incline into the battered
fortress, and seated themselves in the shadow of a crumbling parapet.They were alone on the enormous, grass-grown pile.From their position
they commanded a wonderful view across the town and harbor, and far
out over the green waters of the Caribbean.The _Cossack_ lay asleep
in the quiet harbor.Don Jorge saw it, and wondered whence it came."Listen, _amigo_," began Hitt, pointing to the yacht."In that boat is
a girl, whose dearest earthly treasure is the condemned prisoner out
there in San Fernando.That girl is the little Carmen, foster-daughter
of old Rosendo.""_Hombre!_" cried Don Jorge, staring at Hitt as if he suspected his
sanity."It is true, friend, for I myself came with her in that boat.""_Caramba!_"

"And," continued Hitt, glancing again about the ruined fortress and
lowering his voice, "we have come for Jose de Rincon.""_Santa Virgen!_ Are you _loco_?""And now," he went on eagerly, "how are we to get him?"And he--_por
supuesto_, he will be in the dungeons!""No doubt," returned Hitt dryly, "if your excellent friend Wenceslas
has had anything to do with it."_Caramba_, yes; and San Fernando's are just above the water's edge.And when the waves are high the sea pours into them!""And--could we learn which window is his, do you think?""Senor, I know," replied the man.And--"

"I learned from one of the soldiers, Fernando, who once lived in
Simiti.I had thought, senor, that--that perhaps I--"

"That perhaps you might make the attempt yourself, eh?"Hitt sprang to his feet and looked out toward the
silent fortress."Don Jorge, it is dark out over the harbor at night, eh?Suddenly he stopped, and stood
looking down through a hole in the broken pavement.Then he knelt and
peered long and eagerly into it."It is one of the rooms
of the fortress," he said.I know not how it may be
reached.""But--you are a mighty husky fellow; and I am not weak.Suppose we try
lifting one of these flags.""_Na_, _senor_, as well try the tunnels!But, bidding Don Jorge follow, he sought the
fallen entrance to the old fortress, and plunged into the dark passage
that led off from it into the thick gloom.Groping his way down a
long, damp corridor, he came to a point where three narrower,
brick-lined tunnels branched off, one of them dipping into the earth
at a sharp angle.He struck a match, and then started down this,
followed by the wondering Don Jorge.A thousand bats, hideous denizens of these black tunnels, flouted
their faces and disputed their progress.Don Jorge slapped wildly at
them, and cursed low.Hitt took up a long club and struck savagely
about him.On they stumbled, until the match flickered out, and they
were left in Stygian blackness, with the imps of darkness whirring
madly about them.Hitt struck another match, and plunged ahead.At length they found the way blocked by a mass of rubbish which had
fallen from the roof.Hitt studied it for a moment, then climbed upon
it and, by the aid of the feeble light from his matches, peered into
the foul blackness beyond."Come," he said, preparing to proceed."_Na, amigo!_ Not I!""Then wait for me here," said Hitt, pushing himself through the narrow
aperture at the top of the rubbish, and fighting the horde of
terrified bats.A few minutes later he returned, covered with slime, and scratched and
bleeding."Now let's get out of this
miserable hole!"Out in the sunlight once more, Hitt sought to remove the stains from
his clothes, meanwhile bidding Don Jorge attend well to his words."Then do you come to the beach to-night to bathe, down across from the
yacht.And, listen well: you would do much for the little Carmen, no?You will swim out to the yacht at
seven to-night, with your clothes in a bundle on your head, eh?And,
Don Jorge--but we will discuss that later.Now you go back to the city
alone.And, note this, you have not seen me."Meantime, to the group of politicians, soldiers, and clergy assembled
in the long audience room of the departmental offices to debate the
terms of the peace protocol, news of the arrival of the _Cossack_ was
brought by a slow-moving messenger from the dock.At the abrupt
announcement the acting-Bishop was seen to start from his chair._Quien sabe?_ And, if so--but,
impossible!He would have advised his faithful co-laborer of his
coming.And yet, what were those strange rumors which had trickled
over the wires, and which, in his absorption in the local issues, and
in the excitement attendant upon the restoration of peace and the
settlement of the multifold claims of innumerable greedy politicians,
he had all but forgotten?A thousand suggestions flashed through his
mind, any one of which might account for the presence of the _Cossack_
in Cartagena's harbor that day.But extreme caution must be observed
until he might ascertain its errand.He therefore despatched a message
to the yacht, expressing his great surprise and pleasure, and bidding
its master meet him at a convenient hour in his study in the
Cathedral.This done, he bent anew to the work before him, yet with
his thought harried by doubt, suspicion, and torturing curiosity.Wenceslas soon received a reply to his message.The master was aboard,
but unable to go ashore.The acting-Bishop would therefore come to him
at once.Wenceslas hesitated, and his brow furrowed.He knew he was called upon
to render his reckoning to the great financier who had furnished the
sinews of war.But he must have time to consider thoroughly his own
advantage, for well he understood that he was summoned to match his
own keen wits with those of a master mind.And then there flashed through his thought the reports which had
circled the world but three short weeks before.The man of wealth had
found his daughter; and she was the girl for whom the two Americans
had outwitted him four years ago!And the girl--Simiti--and--ah,
Rincon!He would meet the financier--but
not until the morrow, at noon, for, he would allege, the unanticipated
arrival of Ames had found this day completely occupied.So he again
despatched his wondering messenger to the _Cossack_.And that
messenger was rowed out to the quiet yacht in the same boat with the
tall American, whose clothes were torn and caked with mud, and in
whose eyes there glowed a fierce determination.The harbingers of the wet season had
already arrived.At two in the morning the rain came, descending in a
torrent.In the midst of it a light skiff, rocking dangerously on the
swelling sea, rounded a corner of San Fernando and crept like a shadow
along the dull gray wall.The sentry above had taken shelter from the
driving rain.At one of the narrow, grated windows which were set just above the
water's surface the skiff hung, and a long form arose from its depths
and grasped the iron bars.A moment later the gleam of an electric
lantern flashed into the blackness within.It fell upon a rough bench,
standing in foul, slime-covered water.Upon the bench sat the huddled
form of a man.Then another dark shape rose in the skiff.Another pair of hands laid
hold on the iron bars.And behind those great, calloused hands
stretched thick arms, with the strength of an ox.An iron lever was
inserted between the bars.The heavy breathing and the low sounds of
the straining were drowned by the tropic storm.The prisoner leaped
from the bench and stood ankle-deep in the water, straining his eyes
upward.His
throbbing ears caught the splash of a knotted rope falling into the
water at his feet.Above the noise of the rain he thought he heard a
groaning, creaking sound.Those rusted, storm-eaten bars in the
blackness above must be slowly yielding to an awful pressure.He
turned and dragged the slime-covered bench to the window, and stood
upon it.Then he grasped the rope with a strength born anew of hope
and excitement, and pulled himself upward.The hands from without
seized him; and slowly, painfully, his emaciated body was crushed
through the narrow space between the bent bars.*       *       *       *       *

Cartagena awoke to experience another thrill.And then the ripple of
excitement gave place to anger.The rabble had lost one of its
victims, and that one the chief.Moreover, the presence of that
graceful yacht, sleeping so quietly out there in the sunlit harbor,
could not but be associated with that most daring deed of the
preceding night, which had given liberty to the excommunicated priest
and political malefactor, Jose de Rincon.Crowds of chattering,
gesticulating citizens gathered along the harbor shores, and loudly
voiced their disappointment and threats.But the boat lay like a thing
asleep.Not even a wisp of smoke rose from its yellow funnels.Then came the Alcalde, and the Departmental Governor, grave and
sedate, with their aids and secretaries, their books and documents,
their mandates and red-sealed processes, and were rowed out to
confront the master whom they believed to have dared to thwart the
hand of justice and remain to taunt them with his egregious presence.This should be made an international episode, whose ramifications
would wind down through years to come, and embrace long, stupid
congressional debates, apologies demanded, huge sums to salve a
wounded nation, and the making and breaking of politicians too
numerous to mention!But the giant who received them, bound to his chair, in the splendid
library of the palatial yacht, and with no attendant, save a single
valet, flared out in a towering rage at the gross insult offered him
and his great country in these black charges.He had come on a
peaceful errand; partly, too, for reasons of health.And he was at
that moment awaiting a visit from His Grace.What manner of reception
was this, that Cartagena extended to an influential representative of
the powerful States of the North!"But," the discomfited Indignation Committee gasped, "what of the tall
American who was seen to land the day before?"Why, but a poor, obsessed
archaeologist, now prowling around the ruins of San Felipe, doubtless
mumbling childishly as he <DW8>s the dust and mold of centuries!Go,
visit him, if they would be convinced!And when these had gone, chagrined and mortified--though filled
with wonder, for they had roamed the _Cossack_, and peered into
its every nook and cranny, and stopped to look a second time at the
fair-haired young boy who looked like a girl, and hovered close to
the master--came His Grace, Wenceslas.He came alone, and with a sneer
curling his imperious lips.And his calm, arrogant eyes held a
meaning that boded no good to the man who sat in his wheel chair,
alone, and could not rise to welcome him."A very pretty trick, my powerful friend," said the angered churchman
in his perfect English."And one that will cause your Government at
Washington some--"

"Enough!""I sent for you
yesterday, intending to ask you to release the man.I had terms then
which would have advantaged you greatly.You were afraid to see me
until you had evolved your plans of opposition.Only a fixed and
devilish hatred, nourished by you against a harmless priest who
possessed your secrets, doomed him to die to-day.But we will pass
that for the present.I have here my demands for the aid I have
furnished you.He held out some typewritten
sheets to Wenceslas.The churchman glanced hastily over them; then handed them back with a
smile."The terms on which
peace is concluded will scarcely admit of--"

"Very well," returned Ames quietly."_En manos muertas_, my friend," he replied.A government monopoly, you know," said His Grace easily."You see, my friend, it is a costly matter to effect the escape of
state prisoners.As things stand now, your little trick of last night
quite protects me.For, first you instruct me, long ago, to place the
weak little Jose in San Fernando; and I obey.Then you suffer a change
of heart, and slip down here to release the man, who has become a
state prisoner.That quite removes you from any claims upon us for a
share of the spoils of war.I take it, you do not wish to risk
exposure of your part in this four years' carnage?""Wenceslas," he
said, "I am not the man with whom you dealt in these matters.I have but one thing more to say, and that is that I renounce
all claims upon you and your Government, excepting one.La Libertad
mine was owned by the Rincon family.It was rediscovered by old
Rosendo, and the title transferred to his foster-daughter.Its
possession must remain with her and her associates.There is no
record, so you have informed me, to the effect that the Church
possesses this mine.""But, my friend, there shall be such a record to-day," laughed
Wenceslas."And, in your present situation, you will hardly care to
contest it."He now had the information which he had been seeking.The
title to the famous mine lay still with the Simiti company.He pressed
the call-button attached to his chair.The door opened, and Don Jorge
entered, leading the erstwhile little newsboy, Jose de Rincon, by the
hand.He knew not the man; but the boy
was a familiar figure."Your Grace, were you married to the woman by whom you had this son?"Don Jorge's steady words fell upon the churchman's ears like a
sentence of death."I ask," continued the dark-faced man, "because I learned last night
that the lad's mother was my daughter, the little Maria.""_Santa Virgen!_"

"Yes, Your Grace, a sainted virgin, despoiled by a devil!And the man
who gave me this information--would you like to know?_Bien_, it was
Padre Jose de Rincon, in whose arms she died, you lecherous dog!"Wenceslas paled, and his brow grew moist.He stared at the boy, and
then at the strong man whom he had so foully wronged."If you have concluded your talk with Senor Ames," continued Don
Jorge, "we will go ashore--you and the lad and I."Gaining the deck, Wenceslas
found a skiff awaiting them, and two strong sailors at the oars.Don
Jorge urged him on, and together they descended the ladder and entered
the boat.A few moments later they landed at the pier, and the skiff
turned back to the yacht.There were some who
remembered seeing His Grace pass through the narrow streets with a
dark-skinned, powerful man, whose hand grasped that of the young
newsboy.There were others who said that they saw the boy leave them
at the Cathedral, and the two men turn and enter.Still others said
they saw the heavy-set man come out alone.But there was only one who
discovered the body of Wenceslas, crumpled up in a hideous heap upon
the floor of his study, with a poignard driven clean through his
heart.That man was the old sexton, who fled screaming from the awful
sight late that afternoon.Again Cartagena shook with excitement, and seethed with mystery.Had
the escaped prisoner, Rincon, returned to commit this awful deed?For the dark-skinned man who had
entered the Cathedral with His Grace was seen again on the streets and
in the wine shops that afternoon, and had been marked by some mounting
the broken incline of San Felipe.Again the Governor and Alcalde and their numerous suite paid a visit
to the master on board the _Cossack_.But they learned only that His
Grace had gone ashore long before he met his fearful death.And so the
Governor returned to the city, and was driven to San Felipe.But his
only reward was the sight of the obsessed archaeologist, mud-stained
and absorbed, prying about the old ruins, and uttering little cries of
delight at new discoveries of crumbling passageways and caving rooms.And so there was nothing for the disturbed town to do but settle down
and ponder the strange case.A week later smoke was seen again pouring out of the _Cossack's_
funnels.That same day the Governor and Alcalde and their suites were
bidden to a farewell banquet on board the luxurious yacht.Far into
the night they sat over their rare wines and rich food, drinking deep
healths to the _entente cordial_ which existed between the little
republic of the South and the great one of the North.And while they
drank and sang and listened enraptured to the wonderful pipe-organ, a
little boat put out from the dark, tangled shrubbery along the shore.And when it rubbed against the yacht, a muffled figure mounted the
ladder which hung in the shadows, and hastened through the rear
hatchway and down into the depths of the boat.Then, long after
midnight, the last farewell being said by the dizzy officials, and the
echoes of _Adios_, _adios_, _amigos_!lingering among its tall spars,
the _Cossack_ slipped noiselessly out of the Boca Chica, and set its
course for New York.A few hours later, while the boat sped swiftly through the phosphorescent
waves, the escaped prisoner, Jose de Rincon, who had lain for a week
hidden in the bowels of old fort San Felipe, stood alone in the wonderful
smoking room of the _Cossack_, and looked up at the sweet face pictured
in the stained-glass window above.And then he turned quickly, for the
door opened and a girl entered.A rush, a cry of joy, and his arms
closed about the fair vision that had sat by his side constantly during
the four long years of his imprisonment."I knew you would, for he was with you always!""But--oh, you beautiful, beautiful girl!"Then in a little while she gently released herself and went to the
door through which she had entered.She paused for a moment to smile
back at the enraptured man, then turned and flung the door wide.The man uttered a loud
exclamation and started toward her.He stopped short and stared down at the boy.Then he looked
wonderingly at Carmen."Yes," she said, stooping and lifting the boy up before Jose, "it is
Anita's babe--_and he sees_!"The man clasped the child in his arms and buried his face in its
hair.Verily, upon them that sat in darkness had the Light shined.CHAPTER 21


Another summer had come and gone.Through the trees in Central Park
the afternoon sunlight, sifted and softened by the tinted autumn
leaves, spread over the brown turf like a gossamer web.And it fell
like a gentle benediction upon the massive figure of a man, walking
unsteadily beneath the trees, holding the hand of a young girl whose
beauty made every passer turn and look again."Now, father," laughed the girl, "once more!Why, you step off
like a major!"They were familiar figures, out there in the park, for almost daily
during the past few weeks they might have been seen, as the girl
laughingly said, "practicing their steps."And daily the man's control
became firmer; daily that limp left arm and leg seemed increasingly to
manifest life.On a bench near by sat a dark-featured woman.About her played her
boy, filling the air with his merry shouts and his imperfect English."There, father, comes Jose after us," announced the girl, looking off
with love-lit eyes at an approaching automobile.Now, mind, you are going to get into the car without any help!"The man laughed, and declared vehemently that if he could not get in
alone he would walk home.The profound depth of those changes which had come into the rich
man's life, he himself might not fathom.But those who toiled
daily with him over his great ledgers and files knew that the
transformation went far.There were flashes at times of his former
vigor and spirit of domination, but there were also periods of
grief that were heart-rending to behold, as when, poring over his
records for the name of one whom in years past he had ruthlessly
wrecked, he would find that the victim had gone in poverty beyond
his power to reimburse him.And again, when his thought dwelt on
Avon, and the carnal madness which had filled those new graves there,
he would sink moaning into his chair and bury his drawn face in his
hands and sob.And yet he strove madly, feverishly, to restore again to those from
whom he had taken.The Simiti company was revived, through his labors,
and the great La Libertad restored to its reanimated stockholders.Work of development had begun on the property, and Harris was again in
Colombia in charge of operations.The Express was booming, and the
rich man had consecrated himself to the carrying out of its clean
policies.The mills at Avon were running day and night; and in a new
location, far from the old-time "lungers' alley," long rows of little
cottages were going up for their employes.The lawyer Collins had been
removed, and Lewis Waite was to take his place within a week.Father
Danny, now recovered, rejoiced in resources such as he had never dared
hope to command.And so the rich man toiled--ah, God!if he had only known before that
in the happiness of others lay his own.If only he could have known
that but a moiety of his vast, unused income would have let floods of
sunshine into the lives of those dwarfed, stunted children who toiled
for him, and never played!Oh, if when he closed his mills in the dull
months he had but sent them and their tired mothers to the country
fields, how they would have risen up and called him blessed!If he
could have but known that he was his brother's keeper, and in a sense
that the world as yet knows not!For he is indeed wise who loves his
fellow-men; and he is a fool who hates them!The great Fifth Avenue mansion was dark, except where hung a cluster
of glowing bulbs over the rich mahogany table in the library.There
about that table sat the little group of searchers after God, with
their number augmented now in ways of which they could not have
dreamed.And Hitt, great-souled friend of the world, was speaking
again as had been his wont in the days now gone.Ah, yes, there is a
cure-all; there is a final answer to every ethical question, every
social, industrial, economic problem, the problems of liquor, poverty,
disease, war.And the remedy is so universal that it dissolves even
the tangles of tariff and theology.Ah, my friends, the
girl who came among us to'show the world what love will do' has
taught us by her own rich life--it is love.But not the sex-mesmerism,
the covetousness, the self-love, which mask behind that heavenly name.And to know Him is to receive that marvelous
Christ-principle which unlocks for mankind the door of harmony."No, the world's troubles are not the fault of one man, nor of many,
but of all who seek happiness in things material, and forget that the
real man is the likeness of spirit, and that joy is spiritual.The
trusts, and the men of wealth, are not all malefactors; the churches
are not wholly filled with evil men.But all, yes all, have'missed
the mark' through the belief that matter and evil are real, and must
grope amid sickness, poverty, crime, and death, until they are willing
to turn from such false beliefs, and from self, and seek their own in
the reflection of Him, who is Love, to their fellow-men.It is only as
men join to search for and apply the Christ-principle that they truly
unite to solve the world's sore problems and reveal the waiting
kingdom of harmony, which is always just at hand."In that day all shall know that cause and effect are mental.The man
who hears the tempter, the carnal mind's suggestion to enrich himself
materially at the cost of his brother, will know that it is but the
voice of mesmerism, that'man-killer from the beginning', which bids
him sever himself from his God, who alone is infinite abundance.The
society woman who flits like a gorgeous butterfly about the courts of
fashion, her precious days wasted in motoring, her nights at cards,
and whose vitality goes into dress, and into the watery schemes for
'who shall be greatest' in the dismal realm of the human mind, must
learn, willingly or through suffering, that her activities are but
mesmeric shams that counterfeit the divine activity which manifests in
joy and fullness for all.What is it but the Christ-knowledge, the knowledge of
good, and its correlated knowledge, that evil is only the mesmeric
lie which has engulfed the world?But, oh, the depths of that divine
knowledge!The knowledge which heals the sick, gives sight to the
blind, and opens the prisons to them that are captive!We who are
gathered here to-night, feeling in our midst that great, unseen
Presence which makes for righteousness, know now that 'in my flesh
shall I see God,' for we have indeed already seen and known Him."With them sat the man who, swept by the storms of error and the carnal
winds of destruction, had solved his problem, even as the girl by his
side told him he should, and had been found, when his foul prison
opened, sitting "clothed and in his right mind" at the feet of the
Christ.Jesus "saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit--God--like a
dove descending upon him--immediately the Spirit--carnal belief,
error, the lie--driveth him into the wilderness."And there he was
made to prove God.So Jose de Rincon, when the light had come, years
gone, in desolate Simiti, had been bidden to know the one God, and
none else.But he wavered when the floods of evil rolled over him; he
had looked longingly back; he had clung too tightly to the human
concept that walked with him like a shining light in those dark days.And so she had been taken from him, and he had been hurled into the
wilderness--alone with Him whom he must learn to know if he would see
Life.Then self-consciousness went out, in those four years of his
captivity, and he passed from thence into consciousness of God.Then his great world-knowledge he saw to have been wholly untrue.His
store of truth he saw to have been but relative at best.His knowledge
had rested, he then knew, upon viewpoints which had been utterly
false.And so, like Paul, he died that he might live.He crucified
Self, that he might resurrect the image of God."The world," resumed Hitt, "still worships false gods, though it
reaches out for Truth.Only a
state of consciousness, a consciousness of good, of joy and harmony.And
we are seeking to rid ourselves of the consciousness of evil, with
its sin, its disease and death.But, knowing now that consciousness
is mental activity, the activity of thought, can we not see that
harmony and immortality are within our grasp?Salvation is not from evil realities, but from the
false sense of evil, even as Jesus taught and proved.The only salvation
possible to mankind is in learning to think as Jesus did--not yielding
our mentalities daily to a hodge-podge of mixed thoughts of good and
evil, and then running to doctors and preachers when such yielding
brings its inevitable result in sickness and death.Jesus insisted that
the kingdom of heaven was within men, a tremendous potentiality
within each one of us.By removing hampering
false belief, by removing the limitations of superstition and human
opinion which hold its portals closed.True progress is the release of
mankind from materialism, with its enslaving drudgery, its woes, and
its inevitable death.Mankind's chief difficulty is ignorance of what
God is.He proved Him to be the
creator of the spiritual universe, but not the originator of the lie
of materiality.He showed matter to be but the manifestation of the
false belief that creation is material.He showed it to be but a
sense-impression, without life, without stability, without existence,
except the pseudo-existence which it has in the false thought of
which the human or carnal consciousness is formed.But the lack of
understanding of the real nature of matter, and the persistent belief in
the stability of its so-called laws, has resulted in centuries of
attempts to discredit the Bible records of his spiritual demonstrations
of God's omnipotence and immanence, and so has prevented the human mind
from accepting the proofs which it so eagerly sought.And now, after
nineteen centuries of so-called Christian teaching, the human mind
remains still deeply embedded in matter, and subject to the
consentaneous human beliefs which it calls material laws.Jesus
showed that it was the communal mortal mind, with its false beliefs
in matter, sin, disease, and death, that constituted 'the flesh'; he
showed that mortals are begotten of such false beliefs; he showed
that the material universe is but manifested human belief.And we
know from our own reasoning that we see not things, but our _thoughts_
of things; that we deal not with matter, but with material mental
concepts only.We know that the preachers have woefully missed the
mark, and that the medicines of the doctors have destroyed more lives
than wars and famine, and yet will we not learn of the Master?To reach
God through material thinking is utterly impossible, for He is spirit,
and He can be cognized only by a spiritual consciousness.Yet such a
consciousness is ours, if we will but have it."Ah, friends, God said: Let US make man in OUR image and likeness--let
Life, Love, Spirit make its spiritual reflection.But where is that
man to-day?Buried deep beneath the dogma and the crystallized human
beliefs of mortals--buried beneath 'the lie' which mankind accept
about truth.Nothing but _scientific_ religion will meet humanity's
dire needs and reveal that man.And scientific religion admits of
actual, practical proof.Christianity is as scientific as mathematics,
and quite as capable of demonstration.Its proofs lie in doing the
works of the Master.He is a Christian who does these works; he who
does not is none.Christianity is not a failure, but organized
ecclesiasticism, which always collapses before a world crisis, has
failed utterly.The hideous chicane of imperial government and
imperial religion against mankind has resulted in a Christian veneer,
which cracks at the first test and reveals the unchanged human brute
beneath.The nations which writhe in deadly embrace to-day have never
sought to prove God.They but emphasize the awful fact that the human
mind has no grasp upon the Principle which is God, and at a time of
crisis reverts almost instantly to the primitive, despite so-called
culture and civilization.Yes, religion as a perpetuation of ancient
human conceptions, of materialistic traditions and opinions of 'the
Fathers,' is a flat failure.By it the people of great nations have
been molded into servile submission to church and ruler--have been
persuaded that wretchedness and poverty are eternal--that heaven is a
realm beyond the grave, to which admission is a function of outward
oblation--and that surcease from ills here, or in the life to come, is
a gift of the Church.Can we wonder that commercialism is mistaken by
nations for progress?That king and emperor still call upon God to
bless their barbaric attempts at conquest?And that human existence
remains, what it has always been, a ghastly mockery of Life?"Healing the sick by applied Christianity is not the attempt to alter
a mental concept; it is the bringing out of harmony where before was
discord.He who indulges evil only
proves his belief in its reality and power.Christian healing is not
'mental suggestion,' wherein all thought is material.When evil
thinking is overcome, then the discords which result from it will
disappear from consciousness.Behind all
that the physical senses seem to see, know, and feel, is the spiritual
fact, perfect and eternal.Jesus healed the sick by establishing this
fact in the human consciousness.They must cease from the dust-man,
whose breath is in his nostrils; they must cease from preaching evil
as an awful reality, permitted by God, or existing despite Him; they
must know it as Jesus bade all men know it, as the lie about Truth.Then, by holding the divine ideal before the human mind, they will
cause that mentality gradually to relinquish its false beliefs and
copy the real.And thus, step by step, changing from better to better
beliefs, at length the human mind will have completely substituted
reality for unreality, and will be no more, even in thought.The 'old
man' will have given place to the 'new.'Yes, for the present we reckon with material
symbols; we have not yet fully learned their unreality.But at length,
if we are faithful, we shall lay them aside, and know only Truth and
its pure manifestations."Ah, my friends, how simple is Christianity!It is summed up in the
Sermon on the Mount.He who thinks
right shall know things as they are.He who thinks wrong shall seem to
know them as they are not, and shall pass his days in sore travail,
even in wars, famine, and utter misery.Then why not take up the
demonstration of Christianity in the spirit of joy and freedom from
prejudice with which we pursue our earthly studies, and as gladly,
thankfully seek to prove it?For it, of all things, is worth while.It
alone is the true business of men.For if what we have developed in
our many talks regarding God, man, and the mental nature of the
universe and all things is true, then are the things with which men
now occupy themselves worth while?But are the
things which we have developed true?Yes, for they can be and have
been demonstrated.Carmen has
shown us the way.No, she is not unnatural; she is only divinely
natural.She has shown us what we all may become, if we but will.She
has shown us what we shall be able to do when we are completely lost
in accord with God, and recognize no other life, substance, nor law
than His.But--

"'I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create
evil,' cried the prophet._Truth always has its suppositional
opposite!_ Choose ye then whom ye will serve.Only that which is demonstrably true, not after the change which we
call death, but here this side of the grave, can stand.The only test
of a Christian is in the'signs following.'Without them his faith is
but sterile human belief, and his god but the distorted human concept
whom kings beseech to bless their slaughter."'Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein
  is he to be accounted of?"'His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very
  day his thoughts perish."'That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
  of the Spirit is spirit."'Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though
  we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we
  him no more.'"The fire crackled briskly on the great hearth.Carmen rose and turned
off the light above them.All drew their chairs about the cheery
blaze.Silence, sacred, holy, lay upon them.The rich man, now possessing
treasures beyond his wildest dreams, sat holding his daughter's hand.Sidney had just entered; and Haynerd had
sent word that he would join them soon.Then the silence was broken by the rich man.His voice was unsteady
and low."My friends, sorrow and joy fill my heart to-night.To the first I am
resigned; it is my due; and yet, were it greater, I know not how I
could live.But the joy--who can understand it until he has passed
through death into life!This little girl's mother knew not, nor did
I, that she was royal born.Sometimes I wonder now if it is really so.And yet the evidence is such that I can scarcely doubt.We met in the
sun-kissed hills of Granada; and we loved.Her old nurse was
Argus-eyed; and our meetings were such as only lovers can effect.I
was young, wild, and my blood coursed like a torrent through my veins!But I loved her, yes, base though I was, I loved her.And in these
years since I left her in that little house in Bogota, I have suffered
the agonies of the lost when her memory and my own iniquity fell upon
me and smote me sore--

"We were married in Spain, and the marriage was performed by Padre
Rafael de Rincon.""I was rich; I was roaming the
world, extending my vast business interests; and I took her to
Colombia, where I labored with the politicians in Bogota to grant me
timber and cattle concessions.We had a cottage on the outskirts of
the city, where we were happy.With us lived her faithful old nurse,
whom she would not leave in Spain--

"Then, one day, came a cable message that my father had died.I knew I must return at once to New York.But--I would
not take a wife back with me!And I kissed
her tear-stained face, and bade her wait, for I would return and make
her happy.And then--

"Months later I wrote to her, and, receiving no reply, I caused
inquiry to be made.But she had gone--whither, no one knew.The old
nurse, too, had disappeared.I never learned that a woman had been
left at Badillo to die.She was
timid, and went out seldom.And then--then I thought that a marriage
here would strengthen my position, for I was powerful and proud."Oh, the years that her sad face haunted me!I know
not why, but when the _Cossack_ was built I had her portrait in glass
set in the smoking room.And night after night I have sat before it
and cursed myself, and implored her to forgive!"I was Guillermo to her, and she Dolores to me.Had Carmen ever worn it in my presence I
must have recognized it at once."But," said Ames, choking down his sorrow, "that man is dead.He, like
Goliath, fought Truth, and the Truth fell upon him, crushing him to
powder.The man who remains with you now lives only in this little
girl.And she has brought me my own son, Sidney, and another, Jose.All that I have is theirs, and they will give it to the world.I would
that she could have brought me that noble black man, Rosendo, who laid
down his beautiful life when he saw that his work was done.I learn
from my inquiries that he and Dona Maria lived with Don Nicolas far up
the Boque river during the troublous times when Simiti was burned and
devastated.And that, when the troops had gone, they returned to their
desolated home, and died, within a month of each other.And can my care of their daughter Ana and her little son
ever cancel the debt?"Father, does Jose know that it was Kathleen
whom he rescued from the Tiber in Rome, years ago, and who caused him
to lose his notebook?""No, Sidney,
we had not told him.And how inextricably
bound together we all are!And, Jose, I have not told you that the
woman who lived and died alone in the limestone caves near Honda, and
whose story you had from Don Jorge in Simiti, was doubtless the
faithful old nurse of Dolores.Padre Rafael de Rincon maintained her there."Haynerd entered the room at that moment, and with him came Miss Wall."Now," said Hitt softly, "the circle is complete.Carmen, may I--"

The girl rose at once and went into the music room.Those who remained
sat in awed, expectant silence.Another presence stole softly in, but
they saw him not.Soon through the great rooms and marble halls
drifted the low, weird melody which the girl had sung, long before, in
the dreary Elwin school.In the flickering light of the fire strange shapes took form; and the
shadows that danced on the walls silhouetted scenes from the dimming
past.From out their weird imagery rose a single form.Slowly it rose before them from out the shadows.It was black of face, but its wondrous heart which had cradled the
nameless babe of Badillo glistened like drifting snow.The last sweet notes of the plaintive Indian lament fluttered from the
girl's lips, echoed among the marble pillars, and died away down the
distant corridors.She returned and bent over her father with a tender
caress.Then the great black man in the shadows extended his arms for a moment
above them, and faded from their sight.There was the sound of low
weeping in the room.For

  "these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
  washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
  Lamb."GLOSSARY

the royal family and their followers like chaff before the wind.The Duc
d'Angouleme, compelled to capitulate at Toulouse, sailed from Cette in a
Swedish vessel.The Comte d'Artois, the Duc de Berri, and the Prince de
Conde withdrew beyond the frontier.The
Duchesse d'Angouleme, then at Bordeaux celebrating the anniversary of the
Proclamation of Louis XVIII., alone of all her family made any stand
against the general panic.Day after day she mounted her horse and
reviewed the National Guard.She made personal and even passionate
appeals to the officers and men, standing firm, and prevailing on a
handful of soldiers to remain by her, even when the imperialist troops
were on the other side of the river and their cannon were directed against
the square where the Duchess was reviewing her scanty followers.["It was the Duchesse d'Angouleme who saved you," said the gallant General
Clauzel, after these events, to a royalist volunteer; "I could not bring
myself to order such a woman to be fired upon, at the moment when she was
providing material for the noblest page in her history."--"Fillia
Dolorosa," vol.With pain and difficulty she was convinced that resistance was vain;
Napoleon's banner soon floated over Bordeaux; the Duchess issued a
farewell proclamation to her "brave Bordelais," and on the 1st April,
1815, she started for Pouillac, whence she embarked for Spain.During a
brief visit to England she heard that the reign of a hundred days was
over, and the 27th of July, 1815, saw her second triumphal return to the
Tuileries.She did not take up her abode there with any wish for State
ceremonies or Court gaieties.Her life was as secluded as her position
would allow.Her favourite retreat was the Pavilion, which had been
inhabited by her mother, and in her little oratory she collected relics of
her family, over which on the anniversaries of their deaths she wept and
prayed.In her daily drives through Paris she scrupulously avoided the
spot on which they had suffered; and the memory of the past seemed to rule
all her sad and self-denying life, both in what she did and what she
refrained from doing.[She was so methodical and economical, though liberal in her charities,
that one of her regular evening occupations was to tear off the seals from
the letters she had received during the day, in order that the wax might
be melted down and sold; the produce made one poor family "passing rich
with forty pounds a year."--See "Filia Dolorosa," vol.Her somewhat austere goodness was not of a nature to make her popular.The
few who really understood her loved her, but the majority of her
pleasure-seeking subjects regarded her either with ridicule or dread.She
is said to have taken no part in politics, and to have exerted no
influence in public affairs, but her sympathies were well known, and "the
very word liberty made her shudder;" like Madame Roland, she had seen "so
many crimes perpetrated under that name."The claims of three pretended Dauphins--Hervagault, the son of the tailor
of St.Lo; Bruneau, son of the shoemaker of Vergin; and Naundorf or
Norndorff, the watchmaker somewhat troubled her peace, but never for a
moment obtained her sanction.Of the many other pseudo-Dauphins (said to
number a dozen and a half) not even the names remain.In February,1820, a
fresh tragedy befell the royal family in the assassination of the Duc de
Berri, brother-in-law of the Duchesse d'Angouleme, as he was seeing his
wife into her carriage at the door of the Opera-house.He was carried
into the theatre, and there the dying Prince and his wife were joined by
the Duchess, who remained till he breathed his last, and was present when
he, too, was laid in the Abbey of St.She was present also when
his son, the Duc de Bordeaux, was born, and hoped that she saw in him a
guarantee for the stability of royalty in France.In September, 1824, she
stood by the death-bed of Louis XVIII., and thenceforward her chief
occupation was directing the education of the little Duc de Bordeaux, who
generally resided with her at Villeneuve l'Etang, her country house near
St.Thence she went in July, 1830, to the Baths of Vichy,
stopping at Dijon on her way to Paris, and visiting the theatre on the
evening of the 27th.She was received with "a roar of execrations and
seditious cries," and knew only too well what they signified.She
instantly left the theatre and proceeded to Tonnere, where she received
news of the rising in Paris, and, quitting the town by night, was driven
to Joigny with three attendants.Soon after leaving that place it was
thought more prudent that the party should separate and proceed on foot,
and the Duchess and M. de Foucigny, disguised as peasants, entered
Versailles arm-in-arm, to obtain tidings of the King.The Duchess found
him at Rambouillet with her husband, the Dauphin, and the King met her
with a request for "pardon," being fully conscious, too late, that his
unwise decrees and his headlong flight had destroyed the last hopes of his
family.The act of abdication followed, by which the prospect of royalty
passed from the Dauphin and his wife, as well as from Charles X.--Henri V.
being proclaimed King, and the Duc d'Orleans (who refused to take the boy
monarch under his personal protection) lieutenant-general of the kingdom.Then began the Duchess's third expatriation.At Cherbourg the royal
family, accompanied by the little King without a kingdom, embarked in the
'Great Britain', which stood out to sea.The Duchess, remaining on deck
for a last look at the coast of France, noticed a brig which kept, she
thought, suspiciously near them."To fire into and sink the vessels in which we sail, should any attempt be
made to return to France."Such was the farewell of their subjects to the House of Bourbon.The
fugitives landed at Weymouth; the Duchesse d'Angouleme under the title of
Comtesse de Marne, the Duchesse de Berri as Comtesse de Rosny, and her
son, Henri de Bordeaux, as Comte de Chambord, the title he retained till
his death, originally taken from the estate presented to him in infancy by
his enthusiastic people.Holyrood, with its royal and gloomy
associations, was their appointed dwelling.The Duc and Duchesse
d'Angouleme, and the daughter of the Duc de Berri, travelled thither by
land, the King and the young Comte de Chambord by sea."I prefer my route
to that of my sister," observed the latter, "because I shall see the coast
of France again, and she will not."The French Government soon complained that at Holyrood the exiles were
still too near their native land, and accordingly, in 1832, Charles X.,
with his son and grandson, left Scotland for Hamburg, while the Duchesse
d'Angouleme and her niece repaired to Vienna.The family were reunited at
Prague in 1833, where the birthday of the Comte de Chambord was celebrated
with some pomp and rejoicing, many Legitimists flocking thither to
congratulate him on attaining the age of thirteen, which the old law of
monarchical France had fixed as the majority of her princes.Three years
later the wanderings of the unfortunate family recommenced; the Emperor
Francis II.was dead, and his successor, Ferdinand, must visit Prague to
be crowned, and Charles X. feared that the presence of a discrowned
monarch might be embarrassing on such an occasion.Illness and sorrow
attended the exiles on their new journey, and a few months after they were
established in the Chateau of Graffenburg at Goritz, Charles X. died of
cholera, in his eightieth year.At Goritz, also, on the 31st May, 1844,
the Duchesse d'Angouleme, who had sat beside so many death-beds, watched
over that of her husband.Theirs had not been a marriage of affection in
youth, but they respected each other's virtues, and to a great extent
shared each other's tastes; banishment and suffering had united them very
closely, and of late years they had been almost inseparable,--walking,
riding, and reading together.When the Duchesse d'Angouleme had seen her
husband laid by his father's side in the vault of the Franciscan convent,
she, accompanied by her nephew and niece, removed to Frohsdorf, where they
spent seven tranquil years.Here she was addressed as "Queen" by her
household for the first time in her life, but she herself always
recognised Henri, Comte de Chambord, as her sovereign.The Duchess lived
to see the overthrow of Louis Philippe, the usurper of the inheritance of
her family.Her last attempt to exert herself was a characteristic one.She tried to rise from a sick-bed in order to attend the memorial service
held for her mother, Marie Antoinette, on the 16th October, the
anniversary of her execution.But her strength was not equal to the task;
on the 19th she expired, with her hand in that of the Comte de Chambord,
and on 28th October, 1851, Marie Therese Charlotte, Duchesse d'Angouleme,
was buried in the Franciscan convent."In the spring of 1814 a ceremony took place in Paris at which I was
present because there was nothing in it that could be mortifying to a
French heart.had long been admitted to be one of
the most serious misfortunes of the Revolution.The Emperor Napoleon
never spoke of that sovereign but in terms of the highest respect, and
always prefixed the epithet unfortunate to his name.The ceremony to
which I allude was proposed by the Emperor of Russia and the King of
Prussia.It consisted of a kind of expiation and purification of the spot
on which Louis XVI.I went to see the
ceremony, and I had a place at a window in the Hotel of Madame de Remusat,
next to the Hotel de Crillon, and what was termed the Hotel de Courlande."The expiation took place on the 10th of April.The weather was extremely
fine and warm for the season.The Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia,
accompanied by Prince Schwartzenberg, took their station at the entrance
of the Rue Royale; the King of Prussia being on the right of the Emperor
Alexander, and Prince Schwartzenberg on his left.There was a long
parade, during which the Russian, Prussian and Austrian military bands
vied with each other in playing the air, 'Vive Henri IV.!'The cavalry
defiled past, and then withdrew into the Champs Elysees; but the infantry
ranged themselves round an altar which was raised in the middle of the
Place, and which was elevated on a platform having twelve or fifteen
steps.The Emperor of Russia alighted from his horse, and, followed by
the King of Prussia, the Grand Duke Constantine, Lord Cathcart, and Prince
Schwartzenberg, advanced to the altar.When the Emperor had nearly
reached the altar the "Te Deum" commenced.At the moment of the
benediction, the sovereigns and persons who accompanied them, as well as
the twenty-five thousand troops who covered the Place, all knelt down.The Greek priest presented the cross to the Emperor Alexander, who kissed
it; his example was followed by the individuals who accompanied him,
though they were not of the Greek faith.On rising, the Grand Duke
Constantine took off his hat, and immediately salvoes of artillery were
heard."The following titles have the signification given below during the period
covered by this work:

XVI., afterwards Duchesse d'Angouleme.MADEMOISELLE.......... The daughter of Monsieur, the brother of the King.The problem of how to
produce sufficient for all to enjoy abundance is already solved: the
problem that then remains is--How to get rid of those whose greed and
callous indifference to the sufferings of others, prevents it being
done.'and you'll never be able to get rid of 'em, mate,' cried Crass,
triumphantly--and the man with the copper wire stitches in his boot
said that it couldn't be done.'Well, we mean to have a good try, anyhow,' said Barrington.Crass and most of the others tried hard to think of something to say in
defence of the existing state of affairs, or against the proposals put
forward by the lecturer; but finding nothing, they maintained a sullen
and gloomy silence.The man with the copper wire stitches in his boot
in particular appeared to be very much upset; perhaps he was afraid
that if the things advocated by the speaker ever came to pass he would
not have any boots at all.To assume that he had some such thought as
this, is the only rational way to account for his hostility, for in his
case no change could have been for the worse unless it reduced him to
almost absolute nakedness and starvation.To judge by their unwillingness to consider any proposals to alter the
present system, one might have supposed that they were afraid of losing
something, instead of having nothing to lose--except their poverty.It was not till the chairman had made several urgent appeals for more
questions that Crass brightened up: a glad smile slowly spread over and
illuminated his greasy visage: he had at last thought of a most serious
and insurmountable obstacle to the establishment of the Co-operative
Commonwealth.'What,' he demanded, in a loud voice, 'what are you goin' to do, in
this 'ere Socialist Republic of yours, with them wot WON'T WORK'!'As Crass flung this bombshell into the Socialist camp, the miserable,
ragged-trousered crew around him could scarce forbear a cheer; but the
more intelligent part of the audience only laughed.'We don't believe that there will be any such people as that,' said
Barrington.'There's plenty of 'em about now, anyway,' sneered Crass.'You can't change 'uman nature, you know,' cried the man behind the
moat, and the one who had the copper wire stitches in his boot laughed
scornfully.'Yes, I know there are plenty such now,' rejoined Barrington.'It's
only what is to be expected, considering that practically all workers
live in poverty, and are regarded with contempt.The conditions under
which most of the work is done at present are so unpleasant and
degrading that everyone refuses to do any unless they are compelled;
none of us here, for instance, would continue to work for Rushton if it
were not for the fact that we have either to do so or starve; and when
we do work we only just earn enough to keep body and soul together.Under the present system everybody who can possibly manage to do so
avoids doing any work, the only difference being that some people do
their loafing better than others.The aristocracy are too lazy to
work, but they seem to get on all right; they have their tenants to
work for them.Rushton is too lazy to work, so he has arranged that we
and Nimrod shall work instead, and he fares much better than any of us
who do work.Then there is another kind of loafers who go about
begging and occasionally starving rather than submit to such abominable
conditions as are offered to them.These last are generally not much
worse off than we are and they are often better off.At present,
people have everything to gain and but little to lose by refusing to
work.Under Socialism it would be just the reverse; the conditions of
labour would be so pleasant, the hours of obligatory work so few, and
the reward so great, that it is absurd to imagine that any one would be
so foolish as to incur the contempt of his fellows and make himself a
social outcast by refusing to do the small share of work demanded of
him by the community of which he was a member.'As for what we should do to such individuals if there did happen to be
some, I can assure you that we would not treat them as you treat them
now.We would not dress them up in silk and satin and broadcloth and
fine linen: we would not embellish them, as you do, with jewels of gold
and jewels of silver and with precious stones; neither should we allow
them to fare sumptuously every day.Our method of dealing with them
would be quite different from yours.In the Co-operative Commonwealth
there will be no place for loafers; whether they call themselves
aristocrats or tramps, those who are too lazy to work shall have no
share in the things that are produced by the labour of others.If any man will not work, neither
shall he eat.Under the present system a man who is really too lazy to
work may stop you in the street and tell you that he cannot get
employment.For all you know, he may be telling the truth, and if you
have any feeling and are able, you will help him.But in the Socialist
State no one would have such an excuse, because everyone that was
willing would be welcome to come and help in the work of producing
wealth and happiness for all, and afterwards he would also be welcome
to his full share of the results.'inquired the chairman, breaking the gloomy
silence that followed.'I don't want anyone to think that I am blaming any of these
present-day loafers,' Barrington added.'The wealthy ones cannot be
expected voluntarily to come and work under existing conditions and if
they were to do so they would be doing more harm than good--they would
be doing some poor wretches out of employment.They are not to be
blamed; the people who are to blame are the working classes themselves,
who demand and vote for the continuance of the present system.As for
the other class of loafers--those at the bottom, the tramps and people
of that sort, if they were to become sober and industrious tomorrow,
they also would be doing more harm than good to the other workers; it
would increase the competition for work.If all the loafers in
Mugsborough could suddenly be transformed into decent house painters
next week, Nimrod might be able to cut down the wages another penny an
hour.I don't wish to speak disrespectfully of these tramps at all.Some of them are such simply because they would rather starve than
submit to the degrading conditions that we submit to, they do not see
the force of being bullied and chased, and driven about in order to
gain semi-starvation and rags.They are able to get those without
working; and I sometimes think that they are more worthy of respect and
are altogether a nobler type of beings than a lot of broken-spirited
wretches like ourselves, who are always at the mercy of our masters,
and always in dread of the sack.''Do you mean to say as the time will ever come when the gentry will mix
up on equal terms with the likes of us?'demanded the man behind the
moat, scornfully.When we get Socialism there won't be
any people like us.The man behind the moat did not seem very satisfied with this answer,
and told the others that he could not see anything to laugh at.'Now is your chance to
get some of your own back, but don't hall speak at once.''I should like to know who's goin' to do all the dirty work?''If everyone is to be allowed to choose 'is own trade, who'd be
fool enough to choose to be a scavenger, a sweep, a dustman or a sewer
man?nobody wouldn't want to do such jobs as them and everyone would be
after the soft jobs.''Of course,' cried Crass, eagerly clutching at this last straw.'The
thing sounds all right till you comes to look into it, but it wouldn't
never work!''It would be very easy to deal with any difficulty of that sort,'
replied Barrington, 'if it were found that too many people were
desirous of pursuing certain callings, it would be known that the
conditions attached to those kinds of work were unfairly easy, as
compared with other lines, so the conditions in those trades would be
made more severe.If we
found that too many persons wished to be doctors, architects, engineers
and so forth, we would increase the severity of the examinations.This
would scare away all but the most gifted and enthusiastic.We should
thus at one stroke reduce the number of applicants and secure the very
best men for the work--we should have better doctors, better
architects, better engineers than before.'As regards those disagreeable tasks for which there was a difficulty
in obtaining volunteers, we should adopt the opposite means.Suppose
that six hours was the general thing; and we found that we could not
get any sewer men; we should reduce the hours of labour in that
department to four, or if necessary to two, in order to compensate for
the disagreeable nature of the work.'Another way out of such difficulties would be to have a separate
division of the Industrial army to do all such work, and to make it
obligatory for every man to put in his first year of State service as a
member of this corps.Everyone
gets the benefit of such work; there would be no injustice in requiring
everyone to share.This would have the effect also of stimulating
invention; it would be to everyone's interest to think out means of
doing away with such kinds of work and there is no doubt that most of
it will be done by machinery in some way or other.A few years ago the
only way to light up the streets of a town was to go round to each
separate gas lamp and light each jet, one at a time: now, we press a
few buttons and light up the town with electricity.In the future we
shall probably be able to press a button and flush the sewers.''I suppose there won't be no
churches nor chapels; we shall all have to be atheists.''Everybody will be perfectly free to enjoy their own opinions and to
practise any religion they like; but no religion or sect will be
maintained by the State.If any congregation or body of people wish to
have a building for their own exclusive use as a church or chapel or
lecture hall it will be supplied to them by the State on the same terms
as those upon which dwelling houses will be supplied; the State will
construct the special kind of building and the congregation will have
to pay the rent, the amount to be based on the cost of construction, in
paper money of course.As far as the embellishment or decoration of
such places is concerned, there will of course be nothing to prevent
the members of the congregation if they wish from doing any such work
as that themselves in their own spare time of which they will have
plenty.''If everybody's got to do their share of work, where's the minister and
clergymen to come from?''There are at least three ways out of that difficulty.First,
ministers of religion could be drawn from the ranks of the
Veterans--men over forty-five years old who had completed their term of
State service.You must remember that these will not be worn out
wrecks, as too many of the working classes are at that age now.They
will have had good food and clothing and good general conditions all
their lives; and consequently they will be in the very prime of life.They will be younger than many of us now are at thirty; they will be
ideal men for the positions we are speaking of.All well educated in
their youth, and all will have had plenty of leisure for self culture
during the years of their State service and they will have the
additional recommendation that their congregation will not be required
to pay anything for their services.'Another way: If a congregation wished to retain the full-time services
of a young man whom they thought specially gifted but who had not
completed his term of State service, they could secure him by paying
the State for his services; thus the young man would still remain in
State employment, he would still continue to receive his pay from the
National Treasury, and at the age of forty-five would be entitled to
his pension like any other worker, and after that the congregation
would not have to pay the State anything.'A third--and as it seems to me, the most respectable way--would be for
the individual in question to act as minister or pastor or lecturer or
whatever it was, to the congregation without seeking to get out of
doing his share of the State service.The hours of obligatory work
would be so short and the work so light that he would have abundance of
leisure to prepare his orations without sponging on his
co-religionists.''Of course,' added Barrington, 'it would not only be congregations of
Christians who could adopt any of these methods.It is possible that a
congregation of agnostics, for instance, might want a separate building
or to maintain a lecturer.''What the 'ell's an agnostic?''An agnostic,' said the man behind the moat, 'is a bloke wot don't
believe nothing unless 'e see it with 'is own eyes.''All these details,' continued the speaker, 'of the organization of
affairs and the work of the Co-operative Commonwealth, are things which
do not concern us at all.They have merely been suggested by different
individuals as showing some ways in which these things could be
arranged.The exact methods to be adopted will be decided upon by the
opinion of the majority when the work is being done.Meantime, what we
have to do is to insist upon the duty of the State to provide
productive work for the unemployed, the State feeding of
schoolchildren, the nationalization or Socialization of Railways; Land;
the Trusts, and all public services that are still in the hands of
private companies.If you wish to see these things done, you must
cease from voting for Liberal and Tory sweaters, shareholders of
companies, lawyers, aristocrats, and capitalists; and you must fill the
House of Commons with Revolutionary Socialists.That is--with men who
are in favour of completely changing the present system.And in the
day that you do that, you will have solved the poverty "problem".No
more tramping the streets begging for a job!No more women and
children killing themselves with painful labour whilst strong men stand
idly by; but joyous work and joyous leisure for all.''Is it true,' said Easton, 'that Socialists intend to do away with the
Army and Navy?'Socialists believe in International Brotherhood and
peace.Nearly all wars are caused by profit-seeking capitalists,
seeking new fields for commercial exploitation, and by aristocrats who
make it the means of glorifying themselves in the eyes of the deluded
common people.You must remember that Socialism is not only a
national, but an international movement and when it is realized, there
will be no possibility of war, and we shall no longer need to maintain
an army and navy, or to waste a lot of labour building warships or
manufacturing arms and ammunition.All those people who are now
employed will then be at liberty to assist in the great work of
producing the benefits of civilization; creating wealth and knowledge
and happiness for themselves and others--Socialism means Peace on earth
and goodwill to all mankind.But in the meantime we know that the
people of other nations are not yet all Socialists; we do not forget
that in foreign countries--just the same as in Britain--there are large
numbers of profit seeking capitalists, who are so destitute of
humanity, that if they thought it could be done successfully and with
profit to themselves they would not scruple to come here to murder and
to rob.We do not forget that in foreign countries--the same as
here--there are plenty of so-called "Christian" bishops and priests
always ready to give their benediction to any such murderous projects,
and to blasphemously pray to the Supreme Being to help his children to
slay each other like wild beasts.And knowing and remembering all
this, we realize that until we have done away with capitalism,
aristocracy and anti-Christian clericalism, it is our duty to be
prepared to defend our homes and our native land.And therefore we are
in favour of maintaining national defensive forces in the highest
possible state of efficiency.But that does not mean that we are in
favour of the present system of organizing those forces.We do not
believe in conscription, and we do not believe that the nation should
continue to maintain a professional standing army to be used at home
for the purpose of butchering men and women of the working classes in
the interests of a handful of capitalists, as has been done at
Featherstone and Belfast; or to be used abroad to murder and rob the
people of other nations.Socialists advocate the establishment of a
National Citizen Army, for defensive purposes only.We believe that
every able bodied man should be compelled to belong to this force and
to undergo a course of military training, but without making him into a
professional soldier, or taking him away from civil life, depriving him
of the rights of citizenship or making him subject to military "law"
which is only another name for tyranny and despotism.This Citizen
Army could be organized on somewhat similar lines to the present
Territorial Force, with certain differences.For instance, we do not
believe--as our present rulers do--that wealth and aristocratic
influence are the two most essential qualifications for an efficient
officer; we believe that all ranks should be attainable by any man, no
matter how poor, who is capable of passing the necessary examinations,
and that there should be no expense attached to those positions which
the Government grant, or the pay, is not sufficient to cover.The
officers could be appointed in any one of several ways: They might be
elected by the men they would have to command, the only qualification
required being that they had passed their examinations, or they might
be appointed according to merit--the candidate obtaining the highest
number of marks at the examinations to have the first call on any
vacant post, and so on in order of merit.We believe in the total
abolition of courts martial, any offence against discipline should be
punishable by the ordinary civil law--no member of the Citizen Army
being deprived of the rights of a citizen.''Nobody wants to interfere with the Navy except to make its
organization more democratic--the same as that of the Citizen Army--and
to protect its members from tyranny by entitling them to be tried in a
civil court for any alleged offence.'It has been proved that if the soil of this country were
scientifically cultivated, it is capable of producing sufficient to
maintain a population of a hundred millions of people.Our present
population is only about forty millions, but so long as the land
remains in the possession of persons who refuse to allow it to be
cultivated we shall continue to be dependent on other countries for our
food supply.So long as we are in that position, and so long as
foreign countries are governed by Liberal and Tory capitalists, we
shall need the Navy to protect our overseas commerce from them.If we
had a Citizen Army such as I have mentioned, of nine or ten millions of
men and if the land of this country was properly cultivated, we should
be invincible at home.No foreign power would ever be mad enough to
attempt to land their forces on our shores.But they would now be able
to starve us all to death in a month if it were not for the Navy.It's
a sensible and creditable position, isn't it?''Even in times of peace, thousands of people standing idle and tamely
starving in their own fertile country, because a few land "Lords"
forbid them to cultivate it.'demanded Philpot, breaking a prolonged
silence.'Would any Liberal or Tory capitalist like to get up into the pulpit
and oppose the speaker?'the chairman went on, finding that no one
responded to his appeal for questions.'As there's no more questions and no one won't get up into the pulpit,
it is now my painful duty to call upon someone to move a resolution.''Well, Mr Chairman,' said Harlow, 'I may say that when I came on this
firm I was a Liberal, but through listenin' to several lectures by
Professor Owen and attendin' the meetings on the hill at Windley and
reading the books and pamphlets I bought there and from Owen, I came to
the conclusion some time ago that it's a mug's game for us to vote for
capitalists whether they calls theirselves Liberals or Tories.They're
all alike when you're workin' for 'em; I defy any man to say what's the
difference between a Liberal and a Tory employer.There is none--there
can't be; they're both sweaters, and they've got to be, or they
wouldn't be able to compete with each other.And since that's what
they are, I say it's a mug's game for us to vote 'em into Parliament to
rule over us and to make laws that we've got to abide by whether we
like it or not.There's nothing to choose between 'em, and the proof of
it is that it's never made much difference to us which party was in or
which was out.It's quite true that in the past both of 'em have
passed good laws, but they've only done it when public opinion was so
strong in favour of it that they knew there was no getting out of it,
and then it was a toss up which side did it.'That's the way I've been lookin' at things lately, and I'd almost made
up my mind never to vote no more, or to trouble myself about politics
at all, because although I could see there was no sense in voting for
Liberal or Tory capitalists, at the same time I must admit I couldn't
make out how Socialism was going to help us.But the explanation of it
which Professor Barrington has given us this afternoon has been a bit
of an eye opener for me, and with your permission I should like to move
as a resolution, "That it is the opinion of this meeting that Socialism
is the only remedy for Unemployment and Poverty."'The conclusion of Harlow's address was greeted with loud cheers from
the Socialists, but most of the Liberal and Tory supporters of the
present system maintained a sulky silence.'I'll second that resolution,' said Easton.'And I'll lay a bob both ways,' remarked Bundy.The resolution was
then put, and though the majority were against it, the Chairman
declared it was carried unanimously.By this time the violence of the storm had in a great measure abated,
but as rain was still falling it was decided not to attempt to resume
work that day.Besides, it would have been too late, even if the
weather had cleared up.'P'raps it's just as well it 'as rained,' remarked one man.'If it
'adn't some of us might 'ave got the sack tonight.As it is, there'll
be hardly enough for all of us to do tomorrer and Saturday mornin' even
if it is fine.'This was true: nearly all the outside was finished, and what remained
to be done was ready for the final coat.Inside all there was to do
was to colour wash the walls and to give the woodwork of the kitchen
and scullery the last coat of paint.It was inevitable--unless the firm had some other work for them to do
somewhere else--that there would be a great slaughter on Saturday.'Now,' said Philpot, assuming what he meant to be the manner of a
school teacher addressing children, 'I wants you hall to make a
speshall heffort and get 'ere very early in the mornin'--say about four
o'clock--and them wot doos the most work tomorrer, will get a prize on
Saturday.''Yes,' replied Philpot, 'and not honly will you get a prize for good
conduck tomorrer, but if you all keep on workin' like we've bin doing
lately till you're too hold and wore hout to do any more, you'll be
allowed to go to a nice workhouse for the rest of your lives!and each
one of you will be given a title--"Pauper!"'Although the majority of them had mothers or fathers or other near
relatives who had already succeeded to the title--they laughed!As they were going home, Crass paused at the gate, and pointing up to
the large gable at the end of the house, he said to Philpot:

'You'll want the longest ladder--the 65, for that, tomorrow.'Chapter 46

The 'Sixty-five'


The next morning after breakfast, Philpot, Sawkins, Harlow and
Barrington went to the Yard to get the long ladder--the 65--so called
because it had sixty-five rungs.It was really what is known as a
builder's scaffold ladder, and it had been strengthened by several iron
bolts or rods which passed through just under some of the rungs.One
side of the ladder had an iron band or ribbon twisted and nailed round
it spirally.It was not at all suitable for painters' work, being
altogether too heavy and cumbrous.However, as none of the others were
long enough to reach the high gable at the Refuge, they managed, with a
struggle, to get it down from the hooks and put it on one of the
handcarts and soon passed through the streets of mean and dingy houses
in the vicinity of the yard, and began the ascent of the long hill.There had been a lot of rain during the night, and the sky was still
overcast with dark grey clouds.The cart went heavily over the muddy
road; Sawkins was at the helm, holding the end of the ladder and
steering; the others walked a little further ahead, at the sides of the
cart.It was such hard work that by the time they were half-way up the hill
they were so exhausted and out of breath that they had to stop for a
rest.'This is a bit of all right, ain't it?'remarked Harlow as he took off
his cap and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his handkerchief.While they rested they kept a good look out for Rushton or Hunter, who
were likely to pass by at any moment.At first, no one made any reply to Harlow's observation, for they were
all out of breath and Philpot's lean fingers trembled violently as he
wiped the perspiration from his face.'Yes, mate,' he said despondently, after a while.'It's one way of
gettin' a livin' and there's plenty better ways.'In addition to the fact that his rheumatism was exceptionally bad, he
felt unusually low-spirited this morning; the gloomy weather and the
prospect of a long day of ladder work probably had something to do with
it.'A "living" is right,' said Barrington bitterly.He also was exhausted
with the struggle up the hill and enraged by the woebegone appearance
of poor old Philpot, who was panting and quivering from the exertion.The unaccountable depression that
possessed Philpot deprived him of all his usual jocularity and filled
him with melancholy thoughts.He had travelled up and down this hill a
great many times before under similar circumstances and he said to
himself that if he had half a quid now for every time he had pushed a
cart up this road, he wouldn't need to do anyone out of a job all the
rest of his life.The shop where he had been apprenticed used to be just down at the
bottom; the place had been pulled down years ago, and the ground was
now occupied by more pretentious buildings.Not quite so far down the
road--on the other side--he could see the church where he used to
attend Sunday School when he was a boy, and where he was married just
thirty years ago.Presently--when they reached the top of the hill--he
would be able to look across the valley and see the spire of the other
church, the one in the graveyard, where all those who were dear to him
had been one by one laid to rest.He felt that he would not be sorry
when the time came to join them there.Possibly, in the next world--if
there were such a place--they might all be together once more.He was suddenly aroused from these thoughts by an exclamation from
Harlow.Rushton was coming up the hill
in his dog-cart with Grinder sitting by his side.They passed so
closely that Philpot--who was on that side of the cart--was splashed
with mud from the wheels of the trap.'Them's some of your chaps, ain't they?''We're doing a job up this way.''I should 'ave thought it would pay you better to use a 'orse for sich
work as that,' said Grinder.'We do use the horses whenever it's necessary for very big loads, you
know,' answered Rushton, and added with a laugh: 'But the donkeys are
quite strong enough for such a job as that.'The 'donkeys' struggled on up the hill for about another hundred yards
and then they were forced to halt again.'We mustn't stop long, you know,' said Harlow.'Most likely he's gone
to the job, and he'll wait to see how long it takes us to get there.'Barrington felt inclined to say that in that case Rushton would have to
wait, but he remained silent, for he remembered that although he
personally did not care a brass button whether he got the sack or not,
the others were not so fortunately circumstanced.While they were resting, another two-legged donkey passed by pushing
another cart--or rather, holding it back, for he was coming slowly down
the hill.Another Heir of all the ages--another Imperialist--a
degraded, brutalized wretch, clad in filthy, stinking rags, his toes
protruding from the rotten broken boots that were tied with bits of
string upon his stockingless feet.The ramshackle cart was loaded with
empty bottles and putrid rags, heaped loosely in the cart and packed
into a large sack.Old coats and trousers, dresses, petticoats, and
under-clothing, greasy, mildewed and malodorous.As he crept along
with his eyes on the ground, the man gave utterance at intervals to
uncouth, inarticulate sounds.'That's another way of gettin' a livin',' said Sawkins with a laugh as
the miserable creature slunk past.Harlow also laughed, and Barrington regarded them curiously.He
thought it strange that they did not seem to realize that they might
some day become like this man themselves.'I've often wondered what they does with all them dirty old rags,' said
Philpot.'Made into paper,' replied Harlow, briefly.'Some of them are,' said Barrington, 'and some are manufactured into
shoddy cloth and made into Sunday clothes for working men.'There's all sorts of different ways of gettin' a livin',' remarked
Sawkins, after a pause.'I read in a paper the other day about a bloke
wot goes about lookin' for open trap doors and cellar flaps in front of
shops.As soon as he spotted one open, he used to go and fall down in
it; and then he'd be took to the 'orspital, and when he got better he
used to go and threaten to bring a action against the shop-keeper and
get damages, and most of 'em used to part up without goin' in front of
the judge at all.But one day a slop was a watchin' of 'im, and seen
'im chuck 'isself down one, and when they picked 'im up they found he'd
broke his leg.So they took 'im to the 'orspital and when he came out
and went round to the shop and started talkin' about bringin' a action
for damages, the slop collared 'im and they give 'im six months.''Yes, I read about that,' said Harlow, 'and there was another case of a
chap who was run over by a motor, and they tried to make out as 'e put
'isself in the way on purpose; but 'e got some money out of the swell
it belonged to; a 'undered pound I think it was.''I only wish as one of their motors would run inter me,' said Philpot,
making a feeble attempt at a joke.'I lay I'd get some a' me own back
out of 'em.'The others laughed, and Harlow was about to make some reply but at that
moment a cyclist appeared coming down the hill from the direction of
the job.It was Nimrod, so they resumed their journey once more and
presently Hunter shot past on his machine without taking any notice of
them...

When they arrived they found that Rushton had not been there at all,
but Nimrod had.Crass said that he had kicked up no end of a row
because they had not called at the yard at six o'clock that morning for
the ladder, instead of going for it after breakfast--making two
journeys instead of one, and he had also been ratty because the big
gable had not been started the first thing that morning.They carried the ladder into the garden and laid it on the ground along
the side of the house where the gable was.A brick wall about eight
feet high separated the grounds of 'The Refuge' from those of the
premises next door.Between this wall and the side wall of the house
was a space about six feet wide and this space formed a kind of alley
or lane or passage along the side of the house.They laid the ladder
on the ground along this passage, the 'foot' was placed about half-way
through; just under the centre of the gable, and as it lay there, the
other end of the ladder reached right out to the front railings.Next, it was necessary that two men should go up into the attic--the
window of which was just under the point of the gable--and drop the end
of a long rope down to the others who would tie it to the top of the
ladder.Then two men would stand on the bottom rung, so as to keep the
'foot' down, and the three others would have to raise the ladder up,
while the two men up in the attic hauled on the rope.They called Bundy and his mate Ned Dawson to help, and it was arranged
that Harlow and Crass should stand on the foot because they were the
heaviest.Philpot, Bundy, and Barrington were to 'raise', and Dawson
and Sawkins were to go up to the attic and haul on the rope.None of them had thought of bringing
one from the yard.'Why, ain't there one 'ere?''Do you
mean to say as you ain't brought one, then?'Philpot stammered out something about having thought there was one at
the house already, and the others said they had not thought about it at
all.'Well, what the bloody hell are we to do now?''I'll go to the yard and get one,' suggested Barrington.'I can do it
in twenty minutes there and back.'and a bloody fine row there'd be if Hunter was to see you!'Ere
it's nearly ten o'clock and we ain't made a start on this gable wot we
ought to 'ave started first thing this morning.''Couldn't we tie two or three of those short ropes together?''Those that the other two ladders was spliced with?'As there was sure to be a row if they delayed long enough to send to
the yard, it was decided to act on Philpot's suggestion.Several of the short ropes were accordingly tied together but upon
examination it was found that some parts were so weak that even Crass
had to admit it would be dangerous to attempt to haul the heavy ladder
up with them.'Well, the only thing as I can see for it,' he said, 'is that the boy
will 'ave to go down to the yard and get the long rope.It won't do
for anyone else to go: there's been one row already about the waste of
time because we didn't call at the yard for the ladder at six o'clock.'Bert was down in the basement of the house limewashing a cellar.Crass
called him up and gave him the necessary instructions, chief of which
was to get back again as soon as ever he could.The boy ran off, and
while they were waiting for him to come back the others went on with
their several jobs.Philpot returned to the small gable he had been
painting before breakfast, which he had not quite finished.As he
worked a sudden and unaccountable terror took possession of him.He did
not want to do that other gable; he felt too ill; and he almost
resolved that he would ask Crass if he would mind letting him do
something else.There were several younger men who would not object to
doing it--it would be mere child's play to them, and Barrington had
already--yesterday--offered to change jobs with him.But then, when he thought of what the probable consequences would be,
he hesitated to take that course, and tried to persuade himself that he
would be able to get through with the work all right.He did not want
Crass or Hunter to mark him as being too old for ladder work.Bert came back in about half an hour flushed and sweating with the
weight of the rope and with the speed he had made.He delivered it to
Crass and then returned to his cellar and went on with the limewashing,
while Crass passed the word for Philpot and the others to come and
raise the ladder.He handed the rope to Ned Dawson, who took it up to
the attic, accompanied by Sawkins; arrived there they lowered one end
out of the window down to the others.'If you ask me,' said Ned Dawson, who was critically examining the
strands of the rope as he passed it out through the open window, 'If
you ask me, I don't see as this is much better than the one we made up
by tyin' the short pieces together.Look 'ere,'--he indicated a part
of the rope that was very frayed and worn--'and 'ere's another place
just as bad.''Well, for Christ's sake don't say nothing about it now,' replied
Sawkins.'There's been enough talk and waste of time over this job
already.'Ned made no answer and the end having by this time reached the ground,
Bundy made it fast to the ladder, about six rungs from the top.The ladder was lying on the ground, parallel to the side of the house.The task of raising it would have been much easier if they had been
able to lay it at right angles to the house wall, but this was
impossible because of the premises next door and the garden wall
between the two houses.On account of its having to be raised in this
manner the men at the top would not be able to get a straight pull on
the rope; they would have to stand back in the room without being able
to see the ladder, and the rope would have to be drawn round the corner
of the window, rasping against the edge of the stone sill and the
brickwork.The end of the rope having been made fast to the top of the ladder,
Crass and Harlow stood on the foot and the other three raised the top
from the ground; as Barrington was the tallest, he took the middle
position--underneath the ladder--grasping the rungs, Philpot being on
his left and Bundy on his right, each holding one side of the ladder.At a signal from Crass, Dawson and Sawkins began to haul on the rope,
and the top of the ladder began to rise slowly into the air.Philpot was not of much use at this work, which made it all the harder
for the other two who were lifting, besides putting an extra strain on
the rope.His lack of strength, and the efforts of Barrington and
Bundy to make up for him caused the ladder to sway from side to side,
as it would not have done if they had all been equally capable.Meanwhile, upstairs, Dawson and Sawkins--although the ladder was as yet
only a little more than half the way up--noticed, as they hauled and
strained on the rope, that it had worn a groove for itself in the
corner of the brickwork at the side of the window; and every now and
then, although they pulled with all their strength, they were not able
to draw in any part of the rope at all; and it seemed to them as if
those others down below must have let go their hold altogether, or
ceased lifting.The three men found the weight so
overpowering, that once or twice they were compelled to relax their
efforts for a few seconds, and at those times the rope had to carry the
whole weight of the ladder; and the part of the rope that had to bear
the greatest strain was the part that chanced to be at the angle of the
brickwork at the side of the window.And presently it happened that
one of the frayed and worn places that Dawson had remarked about was
just at the angle during one of those momentary pauses.On one end
there hung the ponderous ladder, straining the frayed rope against the
corner of the brickwork and the sharp edge of the stone sill, at the
other end were Dawson and Sawkins pulling with all their strength, and
in that instant the rope snapped like a piece of thread.One end
remained in the hands of Sawkins and Dawson, who reeled backwards into
the room, and the other end flew up into the air, writhing like the
lash of a gigantic whip.For a moment the heavy ladder swayed from
side to side: Barrington, standing underneath, with his hands raised
above his head grasping one of the rungs, struggled desperately to hold
it up.At his right stood Bundy, also with arms upraised holding the
side; and on the left, between the ladder and the wall, was Philpot.For a brief space they strove fiercely to support the overpowering
weight, but Philpot had no strength, and the ladder, swaying over to
the left, crashed down, crushing him upon the ground and against the
wall of the house.He fell face downwards, with the ladder across his
shoulders; the side that had the iron bands twisted round it fell
across the back of his neck, forcing his face against the bricks at the
base of the wall.He uttered no cry and was quite still, with blood
streaming from the cuts on his face and trickling from his ears.Barrington was also hurled to the ground with his head and arms under
the ladder; his head and face were cut and bleeding and he was
unconscious; none of the others was hurt, for they had all had time to
jump clear when the ladder fell.Their shouts soon brought all the
other men running to the spot, and the ladder was quickly lifted off
the two motionless figures.At first it seemed that Philpot was dead,
but Easton rushed off for a neighbouring doctor, who came in a few
minutes.He knelt down and carefully examined the crushed and motionless form of
Philpot, while the other men stood by in terrified silence.Barrington, who fortunately was but momentarily stunned was sitting
against the wall and had suffered nothing more serious than minor cuts
and bruises.The doctor's examination of Philpot was a very brief one, and when he
rose from his knees, even before he spoke they knew from his manner
that their worst fears were realized.Chapter 47

The Ghouls


Barrington did not do any more work that day, but before going home he
went to the doctor's house and the latter dressed the cuts on his head
and arms.Philpot's body was taken away on the ambulance to the
mortuary.Hunter arrived at the house shortly afterwards and at once began to
shout and bully because the painting of the gable was not yet
commenced.When he heard of the accident he blamed them for using the
rope, and said they should have asked for a new one.Before he went
away he had a long, private conversation with Crass, who told him that
Philpot had no relatives and that his life was insured for ten pounds
in a society of which Crass was also a member.He knew that Philpot
had arranged that in the event of his death the money was to be paid to
the old woman with whom he lodged, who was a very close friend.The
result of this confidential talk was that Crass and Hunter came to the
conclusion that it was probable that she would be very glad to be
relieved of the trouble of attending to the business of the funeral,
and that Crass, as a close friend of the dead man, and a fellow member
of the society, was the most suitable person to take charge of the
business for her.He was already slightly acquainted with the old
lady, so he would go to see her at once and get her authority to act on
her behalf.Of course, they would not be able to do much until after
the inquest, but they could get the coffin made--as Hunter knew the
mortuary keeper there would be no difficulty about getting in for a
minute to measure the corpse.This matter having been arranged, Hunter departed to order a new rope,
and shortly afterwards Crass--having made sure that everyone would have
plenty to do while he was gone--quietly slipped away to go to see
Philpot's landlady.He went off so secretly that the men did not know
that he had been away at all until they saw him come back just before
twelve o'clock.The new rope was brought to the house about one o'clock and this time
the ladder was raised without any mishap.Harlow was put on to paint
the gable, and he felt so nervous that he was allowed to have Sawkins
to stand by and hold the ladder all the time.Everyone felt nervous
that afternoon, and they all went about their work in an unusually
careful manner.When Bert had finished limewashing the cellar, Crass set him to work
outside, painting the gate of the side entrance.While the boy was
thus occupied he was accosted by a solemn-looking man who asked him
about the accident.The solemn stranger was very sympathetic and
inquired what was the name of the man who had been killed, and whether
he was married.Bert informed him that Philpot was a widower, and that
he had no children.'Ah, well, that's so much the better, isn't it?'said the stranger
shaking his head mournfully.'It's a dreadful thing, you know, when
there's children left unprovided for.You don't happen to know where
he lived, do you?''Yes,' said Bert, mentioning the address and beginning to wonder what
the solemn man wanted to know for, and why he appeared to be so sorry
for Philpot since it was quite evident that he had never known him.'Thanks very much,' said the man, pulling out his pocket-book and
making a note of it.'Good afternoon, sir,' said Bert and he turned to resume his work.Crass came along the garden just as the mysterious stranger was
disappearing round the corner.said Crass, who had seen the man talking to Bert.'I don't know exactly; he was asking about the accident, and whether
Joe left any children, and where he lived.He must be a very decent
sort of chap, I should think.'Don't
you know who he is?''No,' replied the boy; 'but I thought p'raps he was a reporter of some
paper.''E ain't no reporter: that's old Snatchum the undertaker.'E's
smellin' round after a job; but 'e's out of it this time, smart as 'e
thinks 'e is.'Barrington came back the next morning to work, and at breakfast-time
there was a lot of talk about the accident.They said that it was all
very well for Hunter to talk like that about the rope, but he had known
for a long time that it was nearly worn out.Newman said that only
about three weeks previously when they were raising a ladder at another
job he had shown the rope to him, and Misery had replied that there was
nothing wrong with it.Several others besides Newman claimed to have
mentioned the matter to Hunter, and each of them said he had received
the same sort of reply.But when Barrington suggested that they should
attend the inquest and give evidence to that effect, they all became
suddenly silent and in a conversation Barrington afterwards had with
Newman the latter pointed out that if he were to do so, it would do no
good to Philpot.It would not bring him back but it would be sure to
do himself a lot of harm.He would never get another job at Rushton's
and probably many of the other employers would'mark him' as well.'So if YOU say anything about it,' concluded Newman, 'don't bring my
name into it.'Barrington was constrained to admit that all things considered it was
right for Newman to mind his own business.He felt that it would not
be fair to urge him or anyone else to do or say anything that would
injure themselves.Misery came to the house about eleven o'clock and informed several of
the hands that as work was very slack they would get their back day at
pay time.He said that the firm had tendered for one or two jobs, so
they could call round about Wednesday and perhaps he might then be able
to give some of them another start, Barrington was not one of those who
were'stood off', although he had expected to be on account of the
speech he had made at the Beano, and everyone said that he would have
got the push sure enough if it had not been for the accident.Before he went away, Nimrod instructed Owen and Crass to go to the yard
at once: they would there find Payne the carpenter, who was making
Philpot's coffin, which would be ready for Crass to varnish by the time
they got there.Misery told Owen that he had left the coffin plate and the instructions
with Payne and added that he was not to take too much time over the
writing, because it was a very cheap job.When they arrived at the yard, Payne was just finishing the coffin,
which was of elm.All that remained to be done to it was the pitching
of the joints inside and Payne was in the act of lifting the pot of
boiling pitch off the fire to do this.As it was such a cheap job, there was no time to polish it properly, so
Crass proceeded to give it a couple of coats of spirit varnish, and
while he was doing this Owen wrote the plate, which was made of very
thin zinc lacquered over to make it look like brass:

                                JOSEPH PHILPOT
                                     Died
                              September 1st 19--
                                Aged 56 years.The inquest was held on the following Monday morning, and as both
Rushton and Hunter thought it possible that Barrington might attempt to
impute some blame to them, they had worked the oracle and had contrived
to have several friends of their own put on the jury.There was,
however, no need for their alarm, because Barrington could not say that
he had himself noticed, or called Hunter's attention to the state of
the rope; and he did not wish to mention the names of the others
without their permission.The evidence of Crass and the other men who
were called was to the effect that it was a pure accident.None of them
had noticed that the rope was unsound.Hunter also swore that he did
not know of it--none of the men had ever called his attention to it; if
they had done so he would have procured a new one immediately.Philpot's landlady and Mr Rushton were also called as witnesses, and
the end was that the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, and
added that they did not think any blame attached to anyone.The coroner discharged the jury, and as they and the witnesses passed
out of the room, Hunter followed Rushton outside, with the hope of
being honoured by a little conversation with him on the satisfactory
issue of the case; but Rushton went off without taking any notice of
him, so Hunter returned to the room where the court had been held to
get the coroner's certificate authorizing the interment of the body.This document is usually handed to the friends of the deceased or to
the undertaker acting for them.When Hunter got back to the room he
found that during his absence the coroner had given it to Philpot's
landlady, who had taken it with her.He accordingly hastened outside
again to ask her for it, but the woman was nowhere to be seen.Crass and the other men were also gone; they had hurried off to return
to work, and after a moment's hesitation Hunter decided that it did not
matter much about the certificate.Crass had arranged the business
with the landlady and he could get the paper from her later on.Having
come to this conclusion, he dismissed the subject from his mind: he had
several prices to work out that afternoon--estimates from some jobs the
firm was going to tender for.That evening, after having been home to tea, Crass and Sawkins met by
appointment at the carpenter's shop to take the coffin to the mortuary,
where Misery had arranged to meet them at half past eight o'clock.Hunter's plan was to have the funeral take place from the mortuary,
which was only about a quarter of an hour's walk from the yard; so
tonight they were just going to lift in the body and get the lid
screwed down.It was blowing hard and raining heavily when Crass and Sawkins set out,
carrying the coffin--covered with a black cloth--on their shoulders.They also took a small pair of tressels for the coffin to stand on.Crass carried one of these slung over his arm and Sawkins the other.On their way they had to pass the 'Cricketers' and the place looked so
inviting that they decided to stop and have a drink--just to keep the
damp out, and as they could not very well take the coffin inside with
them, they stood it up against the brick wall a little way from the
side of the door: as Crass remarked with a laugh, there was not much
danger of anyone pinching it.The Old Dear served them and just as
they finished drinking the two half-pints there was a loud crash
outside and Crass and Sawkins rushed out and found that the coffin had
blown down and was lying bottom upwards across the pavement, while the
black cloth that had been wrapped round it was out in the middle of the
muddy road.Having recovered this, they shook as much of the dirt off
as they could, and having wrapped it round the coffin again they
resumed their journey to the mortuary, where they found Hunter waiting
for them, engaged in earnest conversation with the keeper.The
electric light was switched on, and as Crass and Sawkins came in they
saw that the marble slab was empty.'Snatchum came this afternoon with a hand-truck and a corfin,'
explained the keeper.'I was out at the time, and the missis thought
it was all right so she let him have the key.'Hunter and Crass looked blankly at each other.'Well, this takes the biskit!'said the latter as soon as he could
speak.'I thought you said you had settled everything all right with the old
woman?''I seen 'er on Friday, and I told 'er to
leave it all to me to attend to, and she said she would.I told 'er
that Philpot said to me that if ever anything 'appened to 'im I was to
take charge of everything for 'er, because I was 'is best friend.And
I told 'er we'd do it as cheap as possible.''Well, it seems to me as you've bungled it somehow,' said Nimrod,
gloomily.'I ought to have gone and seen 'er myself, I was afraid
you'd make a mess of it,' he added in a wailing tone.'It's always the
same; everything that I don't attend to myself goes wrong.'Crass thought that the principal piece
of bungling in this affair was Hunter's failure to secure possession of
the Coroner's certificate after the inquest, but he was afraid to say
so.Outside, the rain was still falling and drove in through the partly
open door, causing the atmosphere of the mortuary to be even more than
usually cold and damp.The empty coffin had been reared against one of
the walls and the marble slab was still stained with blood, for the
keeper had not had time to clean it since the body had been removed.'I can see 'ow it's been worked,' said Crass at last.'There's one of
the members of the club who works for Snatchum, and 'e's took it on
'isself to give the order for the funeral; but 'e's got no right to do
it.''Right or no right, 'e's done it,' replied Misery,'so you'd better
take the box back to the shop.'Crass and Sawkins accordingly returned to the workshop, where they were
presently joined by Nimrod.'I've been thinking this business over as I came along,' he said, 'and
I don't see being beat like this by Snatchum; so you two can just put
the tressels and the box on a hand cart and we'll take it over to
Philpot's house.'Nimrod walked on the pavement while the other two pushed the cart, and
it was about half past nine, when they arrived at the street in Windley
where Philpot used to live.They halted in a dark part of the street a
few yards away from the house and on the opposite side.'I think the best thing we can do,' said Misery, 'is for me and Sawkins
to wait 'ere while you go to the 'ouse and see 'ow the land lies.You've done all the business with 'er so far.It's no use takin' the
box unless we know the corpse is there; for all we know, Snatchum may
'ave taken it 'ome with 'im.''Yes; I think that'll be the best way,' agreed Crass, after a moment's
thought.Nimrod and Sawkins accordingly took shelter in the doorway of an empty
house, leaving the handcart at the kerb, while Crass went across the
street and knocked at Philpot's door.They saw it opened by an elderly
woman holding a lighted candle in her hand; then Crass went inside and
the door was shut.In about a quarter of an hour he reappeared and,
leaving the door partly open behind him, he came out and crossed over
to where the others were waiting.As he drew near they could see that
he carried a piece of paper in his hand.'It's all right,' he said in a hoarse whisper as he came up.Misery took the paper eagerly and scanned it by the light of a match
that Crass struck.It was the certificate right enough, and with a
sigh of relief Hunter put it into his note-book and stowed it safely
away in the inner pocket of his coat, while Crass explained the result
of his errand.It appeared that the other member of the Society, accompanied by
Snatchum, had called upon the old woman and had bluffed her into giving
them the order for the funeral.It was they who had put her up to
getting the certificate from the Coroner--they had been careful to keep
away from the inquest themselves so as not to arouse Hunter's or
Crass's suspicions.'When they brought the body 'ome this afternoon,' Crass went on,
'Snatchum tried to get the stifficut orf 'er, but she'd been thinkin'
things over and she was a bit frightened 'cos she knowed she'd made
arrangements with me, and she thought she'd better see me first; so she
told 'im she'd give it to 'im on Thursday; that's the day as 'e was
goin' to 'ave the funeral.''He'll find he's a day too late,' said Misery, with a ghastly grin.'We'll get the job done on Wednesday.''She didn't want to give it to me, at first,' Crass concluded, 'but I
told 'er we'd see 'er right if old Snatchum tried to make 'er pay for
the other coffin.''I don't think he's likely to make much fuss about it,' said Hunter.'He won't want everybody to know he was so anxious for the job.'Crass and Sawkins pushed the handcart over to the other side of the
road and then, lifting the coffin off, they carried it into the house,
Nimrod going first.The old woman was waiting for them with the candle at the end of the
passage.'I shall be very glad when it's all over,' she said, as she led the way
up the narrow stairs, closely followed by Hunter, who carried the
tressels, Crass and Sawkins, bringing up the rear with the coffin.'I
shall be very glad when it's all over, for I'm sick and tired of
answerin' the door to undertakers.If there's been one 'ere since
Friday there's been a dozen, all after the job, not to mention all the
cards what's been put under the door, besides the one's what I've had
give to me by different people.I had a pair of boots bein' mended and
the man took the trouble to bring 'em 'ome when they was finished--a
thing 'e's never done before--just for an excuse to give me an
undertaker's card.'Then the milkman brought one, and so did the baker, and the
greengrocer give me another when I went in there on Saturday to buy
some vegetables for Sunday dinner.'Arrived at the top landing the old woman opened a door and entered a
small and wretchedly furnished room.Across the lower sash of the window hung a tattered piece of lace
curtain.The low ceiling was cracked and discoloured.There was a rickety little wooden washstand, and along one side of the
room a narrow bed covered with a ragged grey quilt, on which lay a
bundle containing the clothes that the dead man was wearing at the time
of the accident.There was a little table in front of the window, with a small
looking-glass upon it, and a cane-seated chair was placed by the
bedside and the floor was covered with a faded piece of drab-
carpet of no perceptible pattern, worn into holes in several places.In the middle of this dreary room, upon a pair of tressels, was the
coffin containing Philpot's body.Seen by the dim and flickering light
of the candle, the aspect of this coffin, covered over with a white
sheet, was terrible in its silent, pathetic solitude.Hunter placed the pair of tressels he had been carrying against the
wall, and the other two put the empty coffin on the floor by the side
of the bed.The old woman stood the candlestick on the mantelpiece,
and withdrew, remarking that they would not need her assistance.The
three men then removed their overcoats and laid them on the end of the
bed, and from the pocket of his Crass took out two large screwdrivers,
one of which he handed to Hunter.Sawkins held the candle while they
unscrewed and took off the lid of the coffin they had brought with
them: it was not quite empty, for they had brought a bag of tools
inside it.'I think we shall be able to work better if we takes the other one orf
the trussels and puts it on the floor,' remarked Crass.'Yes, I think so, too,' replied Hunter.Crass took off the sheet and threw it on the bed, revealing the other
coffin, which was very similar in appearance to the one they had
brought with them, being of elms, with the usual imitation brass
furniture.Hunter took hold of the head and Crass the foot and they
lifted it off the tressels on to the floor.''E's not very 'eavy; that's one good thing,' observed Hunter.''E always was a very thin chap,' replied Crass.The screws that held down the lid had been covered over with
large-headed brass nails which had to be wrenched off before they could
get at the screws, of which there were eight altogether.It was
evident from the appearance of the beads of these screws that they were
old ones that had been used for some purpose before: they were rusty
and of different sizes, some being rather larger or smaller, than they
should have been.They were screwed in so firmly that by the time they
had drawn half of them out the two men were streaming with
perspiration.After a while Hunter took the candle from Sawkins and
the latter had a try at the screws.'Anyone would think the dam' things had been there for a 'undred
years,' remarked Hunter, savagely, as he wiped the sweat from his face
and neck with his handkerchief.Kneeling on the lid of the coffin and panting and grunting with the
exertion, the other two continued to struggle with their task.Suddenly
Crass uttered an obscene curse; he had broken off one side of the head
of the screw he was trying to turn and almost at the same instant a
similar misfortune happened to Sawkins.After this, Hunter again took a screwdriver himself, and when they got
all the screws out with the exception of the two broken ones, Crass
took a hammer and chisel out of the bag and proceeded to cut off what
was left of the tops of the two that remained.But even after this was
done the two screws still held the lid on the coffin, and so they had
to hammer the end of the blade of the chisel underneath and lever the
lid up so that they could get hold of it with their fingers.It split
up one side as they tore it off, exposing the dead man to view.Although the marks of the cuts and bruises were still visible on
Philpot's face, they were softened down by the pallor of death, and a
placid, peaceful expression pervaded his features.His hands were
crossed upon his breast, and as he lay there in the snow-white grave
clothes, almost covered in by the white lace frill that bordered the
sides of the coffin, he looked like one in a profound and tranquil
sleep.They laid the broken lid on the bed, and placed the two coffins side by
side on the floor as close together as possible.Sawkins stood at one
side holding the candle in his left hand and ready to render with his
right any assistance that might unexpectedly prove to be necessary.Crass, standing at the foot, took hold of the body by the ankles, while
Hunter at the other end seized it by the shoulders with his huge,
clawlike hands, which resembled the talons of some obscene bird of
prey, and they dragged it out and placed it in the other coffin.Whilst Hunter--hovering ghoulishly over the corpse--arranged the grave
clothes and the frilling, Crass laid the broken cover on the top of the
other coffin and pushed it under the bed out of the way.Then he
selected the necessary screws and nails from the bag, and Hunter having
by this time finished, they proceeded to screw down the lid.Then they
lifted the coffin on to the tressels, covering it over with the sheet,
and the appearance it then presented was so exactly similar to what
they had seen when they first entered the room, that it caused the same
thought to occur to all of them: Suppose Snatchum took it into his head
to come there and take the body out again?If he were to do so and
take it up to the cemetery they might be compelled to give up the
certificate to him and then all their trouble would be lost.After a brief consultation, they resolved that it would be safer to
take the corpse on the handcart to the yard and keep it in the
carpenter's shop until the funeral, which could take place from there.Crass and Sawkins accordingly lifted the coffin off the tressels,
and--while Hunter held the light--proceeded to carry it downstairs, a
task of considerable difficulty owing to the narrowness of the
staircase and the landing.However, they got it down at last and,
having put it on the handcart, covered it over with the black wrapper.It was still raining and the lamp in the cart was nearly out, so
Sawkins trimmed the wick and relit it before they started.Hunter wished them 'Good-night' at the corner of the street, because it
was not necessary for him to accompany them to the yard--they would be
able to manage all that remained to be done by themselves.He said he
would make the arrangements for the funeral as soon as he possibly
could the next morning, and he would come to the job and let them know,
as soon as he knew himself, at what time they would have to be in
attendance to act as bearers.He had gone a little distance on his way
when he stopped and turned back to them.'It's not necessary for either of you to make a song about this
business, you know,' he said.The two men said that they quite understood that: he could depend on
their keeping their mouths shut.When Hunter had gone, Crass drew out his watch.A little way down the road the lights of a public house were
gleaming through the mist.'We shall be just in time to get a drink before closing time if we buck
up,' he said.And with this object they hurried on as fast as they
could.When they reached the tavern they left the cart standing by the kerb,
and went inside, where Crass ordered two pints of four-ale, which he
permitted Sawkins to pay for.'How are we going on about this job?'inquired the latter after they
had each taken a long drink, for they were thirsty after their
exertions.'I reckon we ought to 'ave more than a bob for it, don't
you?It's not like a ordinary "lift in".''Of course it ain't,' replied Crass.'We ought to 'ave about,
say'--reflecting--'say arf a dollar each at the very least.''I was going to say arf a crown,
myself.'Crass agreed that even half a crown would not be too much.''Ow are we going' on about chargin' it on our time sheets?'asked
Sawkins, after a pause.'If we just put a "lift in", they might only
pay us a bob as usual.'As a rule when they had taken a coffin home, they wrote on their time
sheets, 'One lift in', for which they were usually paid one shilling,
unless it happened to be a very high-class funeral, when they sometimes
got one and sixpence.They were never paid by the hour for these jobs.'I think the best way will be to put it like this,' he said at length.Also takin' corpse
to carpenter's shop."Sawkins said that would be a very good way to put it, and they finished
their beer just as the landlord intimated that it was closing time.The cart was standing where they left it, the black cloth saturated
with the rain, which dripped mournfully from its sable folds.When they reached the plot of waste ground over which they had to pass
in order to reach the gates of the yard, they had to proceed very
cautiously, for it was very dark, and the lantern did not give much
light.A number of carts and lorries were standing there, and the path
wound through pools of water and heaps of refuse.After much
difficulty and jolting, they reached the gate, which Crass unlocked
with the key he had obtained from the office earlier in the evening.They soon opened the door of the carpenter's shop and, after lighting
the gas, they arranged the tressels and then brought in the coffin and
placed it upon them.Then they locked the door and placed the key in
its usual hiding-place, but the key of the outer gate they took with
them and dropped into the letter-box at the office, which they had to
pass on their way home.As they turned away from the door, they were suddenly confronted by a
policeman who flashed his lantern in their faces and demanded to know
why they had tried the lock...

The next morning was a very busy one for Hunter, who had to see several
new jobs commenced.Most of them would
only take two or three days from start to finish.Attending to this work occupied most of his morning, but all the same
he managed to do the necessary business connected with the funeral,
which he arranged to take place at two o'clock on Wednesday afternoon
from the mortuary, where the coffin had been removed during the day,
Hunter deciding that it would not look well to have the funeral start
from the workshop.Although Hunter had kept it as quiet as possible, there was a small
crowd, including several old workmates of Philpot's who happened to be
out of work, waiting outside the mortuary to see the funeral start, and
amongst them were Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk, who were both sober.Barrington and Owen were also there, having left work for the day in
order to go to the funeral.They were there too in a sense as the
representatives of the other workmen, for Barrington carried a large
wreath which had been subscribed for voluntarily by Rushton's men.They could not all afford to lose the time to attend the funeral,
although most of them would have liked to pay that tribute of regard to
their old mate, so they had done this as the next best thing.Attached
to the wreath was a strip of white satin ribbon, upon which Owen had
painted a suitable inscription.Promptly at two o'clock the hearse and the mourning coach drove up with
Hunter and the four bearers--Crass, Slyme, Payne and Sawkins, all
dressed in black with frock coats and silk hats.Although they were
nominally attired in the same way, there was a remarkable dissimilarity
in their appearance.Crass's coat was of smooth, intensely black
cloth, having been recently dyed, and his hat was rather low in the
crown, being of that shape that curved outwards towards the top.Hunter's coat was a kind of serge with a rather rusty cast of colour
and his hat was very tall and straight, slightly narrower at the crown
than at the brim.As for the others, each of them had a hat of a
different fashion and date, and their 'black' clothes ranged from rusty
brown to dark blue.These differences were due to the fact that most of the garments had
been purchased at different times from different second-hand clothes
shops, and never being used except on such occasions as the present,
they lasted for an indefinite time.When the coffin was brought out and placed in the hearse, Hunter laid
upon it the wreath that Barrington gave him, together with the another
he had brought himself, which had a similar ribbon with the words:
'From Rushton & Co.Seeing that Barrington and Owen were the only occupants of the
carriage, Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk came up to the door and asked
if there was any objection to their coming and as neither Owen nor
Barrington objected, they did not think it necessary to ask anyone
else's permission, so they got in.Meanwhile, Hunter had taken his position a few yards in front of the
hearse and the bearers each his proper position, two on each side.As
the procession turned into the main road, they saw Snatchum standing at
the corner looking very gloomy.Hunter kept his eyes fixed straight
ahead and affected not to see him, but Crass could not resist the
temptation to indulge in a jeering smile, which so enraged Snatchum
that he shouted out:

'It don't matter!The distance to the cemetery was about three miles, so as soon as they
got out of the busy streets of the town, Hunter called a halt, and got
up on the hearse beside the driver, Crass sat on the other side, and
two of the other bearers stood in the space behind the driver's seat,
the fourth getting up beside the driver of the coach; and then they
proceeded at a rapid pace.As they drew near to the cemetery they slowed down, and finally stopped
when about fifty yards from the gate.Then Hunter and the bearers
resumed their former position, and they passed through the open gate
and up to the door of the church, where they were received by the
clerk--a man in a rusty black cassock, who stood by while they carried
the coffin in and placed it on a kind of elevated table which revolved
on a pivot.They brought it in footfirst, and as soon as they had
placed it upon the table, the clerk swung it round so as to bring the
foot of the coffin towards the door ready to be carried out again.There was a special pew set apart for the undertakers, and in this
Hunter and the bearers took their seats to await the arrival of the
clergyman.Barrington and the three others sat on the opposite side.There was no altar or pulpit in this church, but a kind of reading desk
stood on a slightly raised platform at the other end of the aisle.After a wait of about ten minutes, the clergyman entered and, at once
proceeding to the desk, began to recite in a rapid and wholly
unintelligible manner the usual office.If it had not been for the
fact that each of his hearers had a copy of the words--for there was a
little book in each pew--none of them would have been able to gather
the sense of what the man was gabbling.Under any other circumstances,
the spectacle of a human being mouthing in this absurd way would have
compelled laughter, and so would the suggestion that this individual
really believed that he was addressing the Supreme Being.His attitude
and manner were contemptuously indifferent.While he recited, intoned,
or gabbled, the words of the office, he was reading the certificate and
some other paper the clerk had placed upon the desk, and when he had
finished reading these, his gaze wandered abstractedly round the
chapel, resting for a long time with an expression of curiosity upon
Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk, who were doing their best to follow in
their books the words he was repeating.He next turned his attention to
his fingers, holding his hand away from him nearly at arm's length and
critically examining the nails.From time to time as this miserable mockery proceeded the clerk in the
rusty black cassock mechanically droned out a sonorous 'Ah-men', and
after the conclusion of the lesson the clergyman went out of the
church, taking a short cut through the grave-stones and monuments,
while the bearers again shouldered the coffin and followed the clerk to
the grave.When they arrived within a few yards of their destination,
they were rejoined by the clergyman, who was waiting for them at the
corner of one of the paths.He put himself at the head of the
procession with an open book in his hand, and as they walked slowly
along, he resumed his reading or repetition of the words of the service.He had on an old black cassock and a much soiled and slightly torn
surplice.The unseemly appearance of this dirty garment was heightened
by the circumstance that he had not taken the trouble to adjust it
properly.It hung all lop-sided, showing about six inches more of the
black cassock underneath one side than the other.However, perhaps it
is not right to criticize this person's appearance so severely, because
the poor fellow was paid only seven-and-six for each burial, and as
this was only the fourth funeral he had officiated at that day,
probably he could not afford to wear clean linen--at any rate, not for
the funerals of the lower classes.He continued his unintelligible jargon while they were lowering the
coffin into the grave, and those who happened to know the words of the
office by heart were, with some difficulty, able to understand what he
was saying:

'Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of His great mercy to take
unto Himself the soul of our Dear Brother here departed, we therefore
commit his body to the ground; earth to earth; ashes to ashes, dust to
dust--'

The earth fell from the clerk's hand and rattled on the lid of the
coffin with a mournful sound, and when the clergyman had finished
repeating the remainder of the service, he turned and walked away in
the direction of the church.Hunter and the rest of the funeral party
made their way back towards the gate of the cemetery where the hearse
and the carriage were waiting.On their way they saw another funeral procession coming towards them.It was a very plain-looking closed hearse with only one horse.There
was no undertaker in front and no bearers walked by the sides.Three men, evidently dressed in their Sunday clothes, followed behind
the hearse.As they reached the church door, four old men who were
dressed in ordinary everyday clothes, came forward and opening the
hearse took out the coffin and carried it into the church, followed by
the other three, who were evidently relatives of the deceased.The
four old men were paupers--inmates of the workhouse, who were paid
sixpence each for acting as bearers.They were just taking out the coffin from the hearse as Hunter's party
was passing, and most of the latter paused for a moment and watched
them carry it into the church.The roughly made coffin was of white
deal, not painted or covered in any way, and devoid of any fittings or
ornament with the exception of a square piece of zinc on the lid.None
of Rushton's party was near enough to recognize any of the mourners or
to read what was written on the zinc, but if they had been they would
have seen, roughly painted in black letters

                                     J.L.Aged 67

and some of them would have recognized the three mourners who were Jack
Linden's sons.As for the bearers, they were all retired working men who had come into
their 'titles'.One of them was old Latham, the venetian blind maker.Chapter 48

The Wise men of the East


At the end of the following week there was a terrible slaughter at
Rushton's.Barrington and all the casual hands were sacked, including
Newman, Easton and Harlow, and there was so little work that it looked
as if everyone else would have to stand off also.The summer was
practically over, so those who were stood off had but a poor chance of
getting a start anywhere else, because most other firms were
discharging hands as well.There was only one other shop in the town that was doing anything at
all to speak of, and that was the firm of Dauber and Botchit.This
firm had come very much to the front during the summer, and had
captured several big jobs that Rushton & Co.had expected to get,
besides taking away several of the latter's old customers.This firm took work at almost half the price that Rushton's could do it
for, and they had a foreman whose little finger was thicker than
Nimrod's thigh.Some of the men who had worked for both firms during
the summer, said that after working for Dauber and Botchit, working for
Rushton seemed like having a holiday.'There's one bloke there,' said Newman, in conversation with Harlow and
Easton.'There's one bloke there wot puts up twenty-five rolls o'
paper in a day an' trims and pastes for 'imself; and as for the
painters, nearly everyone of 'em gets over as much work as us three put
together, and if you're working there you've got to do the same or get
the sack.'However much truth or falsehood or exaggeration there may have been in
the stories of the sweating and driving that prevailed at Dauber and
Botchit's, it was an indisputable fact that the other builders found it
very difficult to compete with them, and between the lot of them what
work there was to do was all finished or messed up in about a quarter
of the time that it would have taken to do it properly.By the end of September there were great numbers of men out of
employment, and the practical persons who controlled the town were
already preparing to enact the usual farce of 'Dealing' with the
distress that was certain to ensue.Mr Bosher talked of
reopening the Labour Yard; the secretary of the OBS appealed for more
money and cast-off clothing and boots--the funds of the Society had
been depleted by the payment of his quarter's salary.There were
rumours that the Soup Kitchen would be reopened at an early date for
the sale of 'nourishment', and charitable persons began to talk of
Rummage Sales and soup tickets.Now and then, whenever a 'job' 'came in', a few of Rushton's men were
able to put in a few hours' work, but Barrington never went back.His
manner of life was the subject of much speculation on the part of his
former workmates, who were not a little puzzled by the fact that he was
much better dressed than they had ever known him to be before, and that
he was never without money.He generally had a tanner or a bob to
lend, and was always ready to stand a drink, to say nothing of what it
must have cost him for the quantities of Socialist pamphlets and
leaflets that he gave away broadcast.He lodged over at Windley, but
he used to take his meals at a little coffee tavern down town, where he
used often to invite one or two of his old mates to take dinner with
him.It sometimes happened that one of them would invite him home of
an evening, to drink a cup of tea, or to see some curiosity that the
other thought would interest him, and on these occasions--if there were
any children in the house to which they were going--Barrington usually
made a point of going into a shop on their way, and buying a bag of
cakes or fruit for them.All sorts of theories were put forward to account for his apparent
affluence.Some said he was a toff in disguise; others that he had
rich relations who were ashamed of him because he was a Socialist, and
who allowed him so much a week so long as he kept away from them and
did not use his real name.Some of the Liberals said that he was in
the pay of the Tories, who were seeking by underhand methods to split
up the Progressive Liberal Party.Just about that time several
burglaries took place in the town, the thieves getting clear away with
the plunder, and this circumstance led to a dark rumour that Barrington
was the culprit, and that it was these ill-gotten gains that he was
spending so freely.About the middle of October an event happened that drew the town into a
state of wild excitement, and such comparatively unimportant subjects
as unemployment and starvation were almost forgotten.Sir Graball D'Encloseland had been promoted to yet a higher post in the
service of the country that he owned such a large part of; he was not
only to have a higher and more honourable position, but also--as was
nothing but right--a higher salary.His pay was to be increased to
seven thousand five hundred a year or one hundred and fifty pounds per
week, and in consequence of this promotion it was necessary for him to
resign his seat and seek re-election.The ragged-trousered Tory workmen as they loitered about the streets,
their stomachs empty, said to each other that it was a great honour for
Mugsborough that their Member should be promoted in this way.They
boasted about it and assumed as much swagger in their gait as their
broken boots permitted.They stuck election cards bearing Sir Graball's photograph in their
windows and tied bits of blue and yellow ribbon--Sir Graball's
colours--on their underfed children.They said that an election had been sprung
on them--they had been taken a mean advantage of--they had no candidate
ready.They had no complaint to make about the salary, all they complained of
was the short notice.It wasn't fair because while they--the leading
Liberals--had been treating the electors with the contemptuous
indifference that is customary, Sir Graball D'Encloseland had been most
active amongst his constituents for months past, cunningly preparing
for the contest.He had really been electioneering for the past six
months!Last winter he had kicked off at quite a number of football
matches besides doing all sorts of things for the local teams.He had
joined the Buffalos and the Druids, been elected President of the Skull
and Crossbones Boys' Society, and, although he was not himself an
abstainer, he was so friendly to Temperance that he had on several
occasions, taken the chair at teetotal meetings, to say nothing of the
teas to the poor school children and things of that sort.In short, he
had been quite an active politician, in the Tory sense of the word, for
months past and the poor Liberals had not smelt a rat until the
election was sprung upon them.A hurried meeting of the Liberal Three Hundred was held, and a
deputation sent to London to find a candidate but as there was only a
week before polling day they were unsuccessful in their mission.Another meeting was held, presided over by Mr Adam Sweater--Rushton and
Didlum also being present.Profound dejection was depicted on the countenances of those assembled
slave-drivers as they listened to the delegates' report.The sombre
silence that followed was broken at length by Mr Rushton, who suddenly
started up and said that he began to think they had made a mistake in
going outside the constituency at all to look for a man.It was
strange but true that a prophet never received honour in his own land.They had been wasting the precious time running about all over the
country, begging and praying for a candidate, and overlooking the fact
that they had in their midst a gentleman--a fellow townsman, who, he
believed, would have a better chance of success than any stranger.Surely they would all agree--if they could only prevail upon him to
stand--that Adam Sweater would be an ideal Liberal Candidate!While Mr Rushton was speaking the drooping spirits of the Three Hundred
were reviving, and at the name of Sweater they all began to clap their
hands and stamp their feet.Loud shouts of enthusiastic approval burst
forth, and cries of 'Good old Sweater' resounded through the room.When Sweater rose to reply, the tumult died away as suddenly as it had
commenced.He thanked them for the honour they were conferring upon
him.There was no time to waste in words or idle compliments; rather
than allow the Enemy to have a walk-over, he would accede to their
request and contest the seat.A roar of applause burst from the throats of the delighted Three
Hundred.Outside the hall in which the meeting was being held a large crowd of
poverty-stricken Liberal working men, many of them wearing broken boots
and other men's cast-off clothing, was waiting to hear the report of
the slave-drivers' deputation, and as soon as Sweater had consented to
be nominated, Didlum rushed and opened the window overlooking the
street and shouted the good news down to the crowd, which joined in the
cheering.In response to their demands for a speech, Sweater brought
his obese carcass to the window and addressed a few words to them,
reminding them of the shortness of the time at their disposal, and
intreating them to work hard in order that the Grand old Flag might be
carried to victory.At such times these people forgot all about unemployment and
starvation, and became enthusiastic about 'Grand old Flags'.Their
devotion to this flag was so great that so long as they were able to
carry it to victory, they did not mind being poverty stricken and
hungry and ragged; all that mattered was to score off their hated
'enemies' their fellow countrymen the Tories, and carry the grand old
flag to victory.The fact that they had carried the flag to victory so
often in the past without obtaining any of the spoils, did not seem to
damp their ardour in the least.Being philanthropists, they were
content--after winning the victory--that their masters should always do
the looting.At the conclusion of Sweater's remarks the philanthropists gave three
frantic cheers and then someone in the crowd shouted 'What's the
colour?'After a hasty consultation with Rushton, who being a'master'
decorator, was thought to be an authority on colours--green--grass
green--was decided upon, and the information was shouted down to the
crowd, who cheered again.Then a rush was made to Sweater's Emporium
and several yards of cheap green ribbon were bought, and divided up
into little pieces, which they tied into their buttonholes, and thus
appropriately decorated, formed themselves into military order, four
deep, and marched through all the principal streets, up and down the
Grand Parade, round and round the Fountain, and finally over the hill
to Windley, singing to the tune of 'Tramp, tramp, tramp, the Boys are
marching':

        'Vote, Vote, Vote for Adam Sweater!Adam Sweater is our man,
        And we'll have him if we can,
        Then we'll always have the biggest loaf for tea.'The spectacle presented by these men--some of them with grey heads and
beards--as they marked time or tramped along singing this childish
twaddle, would have been amusing if it had not been disgusting.By way of variety they sang several other things, including:

        'We'll hang ole Closeland
        On a sour apple tree,'

and

        'Rally, Rally, men of Windley
        For Sweater's sure to win.'As they passed the big church in Quality Street, the clock began to
strike.It was one of those that strike four chimes at each quarter of
the hour.It was now ten o'clock so there were sixteen musical chimes:

        Ding, dong!They all chanted A-dam Sweat-er' in time with the striking clock.In
the same way the Tories would chant:

        'Grab--all Close--land!The town was soon deluged with mendacious literature and smothered with
huge posters:

                      'Vote for Adam Sweater!'Vote for Sweater and Temperance Reform.''Vote for Sweater--Free Trade and Cheap Food.'or

      'Vote for D'Encloseland: Tariff Reform and Plenty of Work!'This beautiful idea--'Plenty of Work'--appealed strongly to the Tory
workmen.They seemed to regard themselves and their children as a sort
of machines or beasts of burden, created for the purpose of working for
the benefit of other people.They did not think it right that they
should Live, and enjoy the benefits of civilization.All they desired
for themselves and their children was 'Plenty of Work'.They marched about the streets singing their Marseillaise, 'Work, Boys,
Work and be contented', to the tune of 'Tramp, tramp, tramp the Boys
are marching', and at intervals as they tramped along, they gave three
cheers for Sir Graball, Tariff Reform, and--Plenty of Work.Both sides imported gangs of hired orators who held forth every night
at the corners of the principal streets, and on the open spaces from
portable platforms, and from motor cars and lorries.The Tories said
that the Liberal Party in the House of Commons was composed principally
of scoundrels and fools, the Liberals said that the Tory Party were
fools and scoundrels.A host of richly dressed canvassers descended
upon Windley in carriages and motor cars, and begged for votes from the
poverty-stricken working men who lived there.One evening a Liberal demonstration was held at the Cross Roads on
Windley Hill.Notwithstanding the cold weather, there was a great
crowd of shabbily dressed people, many of whom had not had a really
good meal for months.The moon was at the full,
and the scene was further illuminated by the fitful glare of several
torches, stuck on the end of twelve-foot poles.The platform was a
large lorry, and there were several speakers, including Adam Sweater
himself and a real live Liberal Peer--Lord Ammenegg.This individual
had made a considerable fortune in the grocery and provision line, and
had been elevated to the Peerage by the last Liberal Government on
account of his services to the Party, and in consideration of other
considerations.Both Sweater and Ammenegg were to speak at two other meetings that
night and were not expected at Windley until about eight-thirty, so to
keep the ball rolling till they arrived, several other gentlemen,
including Rushton--who presided--and Didlum, and one of the five pounds
a week orators, addressed the meeting.Mingled with the crowd were
about twenty rough-looking men--strangers to the town--who wore huge
green rosettes and loudly applauded the speakers.They also
distributed Sweater literature and cards with lists of the different
meetings that were to be held during the election.These men were
bullies hired by Sweater's agent.They came from the neighbourhood of
Seven Dials in London and were paid ten shillings a day.One of their
duties was to incite the crowd to bash anyone who disturbed the
meetings or tried to put awkward questions to the speakers.The hired orator was a tall, slight man with dark hair, beard and
moustache, he might have been called well-looking if it had not been
for a ugly scar upon his forehead, which gave him a rather sinister
appearance.He was an effective speaker; the audience punctuated his
speech with cheers, and when he wound up with an earnest appeal to
them--as working men--to vote for Adam Sweater, their enthusiasm knew
no bounds.'I've seen him somewhere before,' remarked Barrington, who was standing
in the crowd with Harlow, Owen and Easton.'So have I,' said Owen, with a puzzled expression.'But for the life
of me, I can't remember where.'Harlow and Easton also thought they had seen the man before, but their
speculations were put an end to by the roar of cheering that heralded
the arrival of the motor car, containing Adam Sweater and his friend,
Lord Ammenegg.Unfortunately, those who had arranged the meeting had
forgotten to provide a pair of steps, so Sweater found it a matter of
considerable difficulty to mount the platform.However, while his
friends were hoisting and pushing him up, the meeting beguiled the time
by singing:


        'Vote, vote, vote for Adam Sweater.'After a terrible struggle they succeeded in getting him on to the cart,
and while he was recovering his wind, Rushton made a few remarks to the
crowd.Sweater then advanced to the front, but in consequence of the
cheering and singing, he was unable to make himself heard for several
minutes.When at length he was able to proceed, ho made a very clever speech--it
had been specially written for him and had cost ten guineas.A large
part of it consisted of warnings against the dangers of Socialism.Sweater had carefully rehearsed this speech and he delivered it very
effectively.Some of those Socialists, he said, were well-meaning but
mistaken people, who did not realize the harm that would result if
their extraordinary ideas were ever put into practice.He lowered his
voice to a blood-curdling stage whisper as he asked:

'What is this Socialism that we hear so much about, but which so few
understand?What is it, and what does it mean?'Then, raising his voice till it rang through the air and fell upon the
ears of the assembled multitude like the clanging of a funeral bell, he
continued:

'It is madness!Black Ruin for the
rich, and consequently, of course, Blacker Ruin still for the poor!'As Sweater paused, a thrill of horror ran through the meeting.Men
wearing broken boots and with patches upon the seats and knees, and
ragged fringes round the bottoms of the legs of their trousers, grew
pale, and glanced apprehensively at each other.If ever Socialism did
come to pass, they evidently thought it very probable that they would
have to walk about in a sort of prehistoric highland costume, without
any trousers or boots at all.Toil-worn women, most of them dressed in other women's shabby cast-off
clothing--weary, tired-looking mothers who fed their children for the
most part on adulterated tea, tinned skimmed milk and bread and
margarine, grew furious as they thought of the wicked Socialists who
were trying to bring Ruin upon them.It never occurred to any of these poor people that they were in a
condition of Ruin, Black Ruin, already.But if Sweater had suddenly
found himself reduced to the same social condition as the majority of
those he addressed, there is not much doubt that he would have thought
that he was in a condition of Black Ruin.The awful silence that had fallen on the panic-stricken crowd, was
presently broken by a ragged-trousered Philanthropist, who shouted out:

'We knows wot they are, sir.Most of 'em is chaps wot's got tired of
workin' for their livin', so they wants us to keep 'em.'Encouraged by numerous expressions of approval from the other
Philanthropists, the man continued:

'But we ain't such fools as they thinks, and so they'll find out next
Monday.Most of 'em wants 'angin', and I wouldn't mind lendin' a 'and
with the rope myself.'Applause and laughter greeted these noble sentiments, and Sweater
resumed his address, when another man--evidently a Socialist--for he
was accompanied by three or four others who like himself wore red
ties--interrupted and said that he would like to ask him a question.No notice was taken of this request either by Mr Sweater or the
chairman, but a few angry cries of 'Order!'Sweater continued, but the man again interrupted and the cries of the
crowd became more threatening.Rushton started up and said that he
could not allow the speaker to be interrupted, but if the gentleman
would wait till the end of the meeting, he would have an opportunity of
asking his question then.The man said he would wait as desired; Sweater resumed his oration, and
presently the interrupter and his friends found themselves surrounded
by the gang of hired bullies who wore the big rosettes and who glared
menacingly at them.Sweater concluded his speech with an appeal to the crowd to deal a
'Slashing Bow at the Enemy' next Monday, and then amid a storm of
applause, Lord Ammenegg stepped to the front.He said that he did not
intend to inflict a long speech upon them that evening, and as it was
nomination day tomorrow he would not be able to have the honour of
addressing them again during the election; but even if he had wished to
make a long speech, it would be very difficult after the brilliant and
eloquent address they had just listened to from Mr Sweater, for it
seemed to him (Ammenegg) that Adam Sweater had left nothing for anyone
else to say.But he would like to tell them of a Thought that had
occurred to him that evening.They read in the Bible that the Wise Men
came from the East.Windley, as they all knew, was the East end of the
town.They were the men of the East, and he was sure that next Monday
they would prove that they were the Wise Men of the East, by voting for
Adam Sweater and putting him at the top of the poll with a 'Thumping
Majority'.The Wise Men of the East greeted Ammenegg's remarks with prolonged,
imbecile cheers, and amid the tumult his Lordship and Sweater got into
the motor car and cleared off without giving the man with the red tie
or anyone else who desired to ask questions any opportunity of doing
so.Rushton and the other leaders got into another motor car, and
followed the first to take part in another meeting down-town, which was
to be addressed by the great Sir Featherstone Blood.The crowd now resolved itself into military order, headed by the men
with torches and a large white banner on which was written in huge
black letters, 'Our man is Adam Sweater'.They marched down the hill singing, and when they reached the Fountain
on the Grand Parade they saw another crowd holding a meeting there.These were Tories and they became so infuriated at the sound of the
Liberal songs and by the sight of the banner, that they abandoned their
meeting and charged the processionists.Both
sides fought like savages, but as the Liberals were outnumbered by
about three to one, they were driven off the field with great
slaughter; most of the torch poles were taken from them, and the banner
was torn to ribbons.Then the Tories went back to the Fountain
carrying the captured torches, and singing to the tune of 'Has anyone
seen a German Band?''Has anyone seen a Lib'ral Flag,
        Lib'ral Flag, Lib'ral Flag?'While the Tories resumed their meeting at the Fountain, the Liberals
rallied in one of the back streets.Messengers were sent in various
directions for reinforcements, and about half an hour afterwards they
emerged from their retreat and swooped down upon the Tory meeting.They
overturned the platform, recaptured their torches, tore the enemy's
banner to tatters and drove them from their position.Then the
Liberals in their turn paraded the streets singing 'Has anyone seen a
Tory Flag?'and proceeded to the hall where Sir Featherstone was
speaking, arriving as the audience left.The crowd that came pouring out of the hall was worked up to a frenzy
of enthusiasm, for the speech they had just listened to had been a sort
of manifesto to the country.In response to the cheering of the processionists--who, of course, had
not heard the speech, but were cheering from force of habit--Sir
Featherstone Blood stood up in the carriage and addressed the crowd,
briefly outlining the great measures of Social Reform that his party
proposed to enact to improve the condition of the working classes; and
as they listened, the Wise Men grew delirious with enthusiasm.He
referred to Land Taxes and Death Duties which would provide money to
build battleships to protect the property of the rich, and provide Work
for the poor.Another tax was to provide a nice, smooth road for the
rich to ride upon in motor cars--and to provide Work for the poor.Another tax would be used for Development, which would also make Work
for the poor.A great point was made of the fact that the
rich were actually to be made to pay something towards the cost of
their road themselves!But nothing was said about how they would get
the money to do it.No reference was made to how the workers would be
sweated and driven and starved to earn Dividends and Rent and Interest
and Profits to put into the pockets of the rich before the latter would
be able to pay for anything at all.These are the things, Gentlemen, that we propose to do for you, and, at
the rate of progress which we propose to adopt, I say without fear or
contradiction, that within the next Five Hundred years we shall so
reform social conditions in this country, that the working classes will
be able to enjoy some of the benefits of civilization.'The only question before you is: Are you willing to wait for Five
Hundred Years?''Yes, sir,' shouted the Wise Men with enthusiasm at the glorious
prospect.'Yes, Sir: we'll wait a thousand years if you like, Sir!''I've been waiting all my life,' said one poor old veteran, who had
assisted to 'carry the "Old Flag" to victory' times out of number in
the past and who for his share of the spoils of those victories was now
in a condition of abject, miserable poverty, with the portals of the
workhouse yawning open to receive him; 'I've waited all my life, hoping
and trusting for better conditions so a few more years won't make much
difference to me.''Don't you trouble to 'urry yourself, Sir,' shouted another Solomon in
the crowd.You know
better than the likes of us 'ow long it ought to take.'In conclusion, the great man warned them against being led away by the
Socialists, those foolish, unreasonable, impractical people who wanted
to see an immediate improvement in their condition; and he reminded
them that Rome was not built in a day.It did not appear to occur to any of
them that the rate at which the ancient Roman conducted their building
operations had nothing whatever to do with the case.Sir Featherstone Blood sat down amid a wild storm of cheering, and then
the procession reformed, and, reinforced by the audience from the hall,
they proceeded to march about the dreary streets, singing, to the tune
of the 'Men of Harlech':

        'Vote for Sweater, Vote for Sweater!Vote for Sweater, VOTE FOR SWEATER!'He's the Man, who has a plan,
        To liberate and reinstate the workers!'Men of Mugs'bro', show your mettle,
        Let them see that you're in fettle!Once for all this question settle
        Sweater shall Prevail!'The carriage containing Sir Featherstone, Adam Sweater, and Rushton and
Didlum was in the middle of the procession.The banner and the torches
were at the head, and the grandeur of the scene was heightened by four
men who walked--two on each side of the carriage, burning green fire in
frying pans.As they passed by the Slave Market, a poor, shabbily
dressed wretch whose boots were so worn and rotten that they were
almost falling off his feet, climbed up a lamp-post, and taking off his
cap waved it in the air and shrieked out: 'Three Cheers for Sir
Featherstone Blood, our future Prime Minister!'The Philanthropists cheered themselves hoarse and finally took the
horses out of the traces and harnessed themselves to the carriage
instead.''Ow much wages will Sir Featherstone get if 'e is made Prime
Minister?'asked Harlow of another Philanthropist who was also pushing
up behind the carriage.'Five thousand a year,' replied the other, who by some strange chance
happened to know.'That comes to a 'underd pounds a week.''Little enough, too, for a man like 'im,' said Harlow.'You're right, mate,' said the other, with deep sympathy in his voice.'Last time 'e 'eld office 'e was only in for five years, so 'e only
made twenty-five thousand pounds out of it.Of course 'e got a pension
as well--two thousand a year for life, I think it is; but after all,
what's that--for a man like 'im?''Nothing,' replied Harlow, in a tone of commiseration, and Newman, who
was also there, helping to drag the carriage, said that it ought to be
at least double that amount.However, they found some consolation in knowing that Sir Featherstone
would not have to wait till he was seventy before he obtained his
pension; he would get it directly he came out of office.The following evening Barrington, Owen and a few others of the same way
of thinking, who had subscribed enough money between them to purchase a
lot of Socialist leaflets, employed themselves distributing them to the
crowds at the Liberal and Tory meetings, and whilst they were doing
this they frequently became involved in arguments with the supporters
of the capitalist system.In their attempts to persuade others to
refrain from voting for either of the candidates, they were opposed
even by some who professed to believe in Socialism, who said that as
there was no better Socialist candidate the thing to do was to vote for
the better of the two.This was the view of Harlow and Easton, whom
they met.Harlow had a green ribbon in his buttonhole, but Easton wore
D'Encloseland's colours.One man said that if he had his way, all those who had votes should be
compelled to record them--whether they liked it or not--or be
disenfranchised!Barrington asked him if he believed in Tarrif Reform.The other replied that he opposed Tariff Reform because he believed it
would ruin the country.Barrington inquired if he were a supporter of
Socialism.The man said he was not, and when further questioned he
said that he believed if it were ever adopted it would bring black ruin
upon the country--he believed this because Mr Sweater had said so.When
Barrington asked him--supposing there were only two candidates, one a
Socialist and the other a Tariff Reformer--how would he like to be
compelled to vote for one of them, he was at a loss for an answer.The hired orators
continued to pour forth their streams of eloquence; and tons of
literature flooded the town.The walls were covered with huge posters:
'Another Liberal Lie.'Unconsciously each of these two parties put in some splendid work for
Socialism, in so much that each of them thoroughly exposed the
hypocrisy of the other.If the people had only had the sense, they
might have seen that the quarrel between the Liberal and Tory leaders
was merely a quarrel between thieves over the spoil; but unfortunately
most of the people had not the sense to perceive this.They were
blinded by bigoted devotion to their parties, and--inflamed with
maniacal enthusiasm--thought of nothing but 'carrying their flags to
victory'.At considerable danger to themselves, Barrington, Owen and the other
Socialists continued to distribute their leaflets and to heckle the
Liberal and Tory speakers.They asked the Tories to explain the
prevalence of unemployment and poverty in protected countries, like
Germany and America, and at Sweater's meetings they requested to be
informed what was the Liberal remedy for unemployment.From both
parties the Socialists obtained the same kinds of answer--threats of
violence and requests 'not to disturb the meeting'.These Socialists held quite a lot of informal meetings on their own.Every now and then when they were giving their leaflets away, some
unwary supporter of the capitalist system would start an argument, and
soon a crowd would gather round and listen.Sometimes the Socialists succeeded in arguing their opponents to an
absolute standstill, for the Liberals and Tones found it impossible to
deny that machinery is the cause of the overcrowded state of the labour
market; that the overcrowded labour market is the cause of
unemployment; that the fact of there being always an army of unemployed
waiting to take other men's jobs away from them destroys the
independence of those who are in employment and keeps them in
subjection to their masters.They found it impossible to deny that
this machinery is being used, not for the benefit of all, but to make
fortunes for a few.In short, they were unable to disprove that the
monopoly of the land and machinery by a comparatively few persons, is
the cause of the poverty of the majority.But when these arguments
that they were unable to answer were put before them and when it was
pointed out that the only possible remedy was the Public Ownership and
Management of the Means of production, they remained angrily silent,
having no alternative plan to suggest.At other times the meeting resolved itself into a number of quarrelsome
disputes between the Liberals and Tories that formed the crowd, which
split itself up into a lot of little groups and whatever the original
subject might have been they soon drifted to a hundred other things,
for most of the supporters of the present system seemed incapable of
pursuing any one subject to its logical conclusion.A discussion would
be started about something or other; presently an unimportant side
issue would crop up, then the original subject would be left
unfinished, and they would argue and shout about the side issue.In a
little while another side issue would arise, and then the first side
issue would be abandoned also unfinished, and an angry wrangle about
the second issue would ensue, the original subject being altogether
forgotten.They did not seem to really desire to discover the truth or to find out
the best way to bring about an improvement in their condition, their
only object seemed to be to score off their opponents.Usually after one of these arguments, Owen would wander off by himself,
with his head throbbing and a feeling of unutterable depression and
misery at his heart; weighed down by a growing conviction of the
hopelessness of everything, of the folly of expecting that his fellow
workmen would ever be willing to try to understand for themselves the
causes that produced their sufferings.It was not that those causes
were so obscure that it required exceptional intelligence to perceive
them; the causes of all the misery were so apparent that a little child
could easily be made to understand both the disease and the remedy; but
it seemed to him that the majority of his fellow workmen had become so
convinced of their own intellectual inferiority that they did not dare
to rely on their own intelligence to guide them, preferring to resign
the management of their affairs unreservedly into the hands of those
who battened upon and robbed them.They did not know the causes of the
poverty that perpetually held them and their children in its cruel
grip, and--they did not want to know!And if one explained those
causes to them in such language and in such a manner that they were
almost compelled to understand, and afterwards pointed out to them the
obvious remedy, they were neither glad nor responsive, but remained
silent and were angry because they found themselves unable to answer
and disprove.They remained silent; afraid to trust their own intelligence, and the
reason of this attitude was that they had to choose between the
evidence and their own intelligence, and the stories told them by their
masters and exploiters.And when it came to making this choice they
deemed it safer to follow their old guides, than to rely on their own
judgement, because from their very infancy they had had drilled into
them the doctrine of their own mental and social inferiority, and their
conviction of the truth of this doctrine was voiced in the degraded
expression that fell so frequently from their lips, when speaking of
themselves and each other--'The Likes of Us!'They did not know the causes of their poverty, they did not want to
know, they did not want to hear.All they desired was to be left alone so that they might continue to
worship and follow those who took advantage of their simplicity, and
robbed them of the fruits of their toil; their old leaders, the fools
or scoundrels who fed them with words, who had led them into the
desolation where they now seemed to be content to grind out treasure
for their masters, and to starve when those masters did not find it
profitable to employ them.It was as if a flock of foolish sheep
placed themselves under the protection of a pack of ravening wolves.Several times the small band of Socialists narrowly escaped being
mobbed, but they succeeded in disposing of most of their leaflets
without any serious trouble.Towards the latter part of one evening
Barrington and Owen became separated from the others, and shortly
afterwards these two lost each other in the crush.About nine o'clock, Barrington was in a large Liberal crowd, listening
to the same hired orator who had spoken a few evenings before on the
hill--the man with the scar on his forehead.The crowd was applauding
him loudly and Barrington again fell to wondering where he had seen
this man before.As on the previous occasion, this speaker made no
reference to Socialism, confining himself to other matters.Barrington
examined him closely, trying to recall under what circumstances they
had met previously, and presently he remembered that this was one of
the Socialists who had come with the band of cyclists into the town
that Sunday morning, away back at the beginning of the summer, the man
who had come afterwards with the van, and who had been struck down by a
stone while attempting to speak from the platform of the van, the man
who had been nearly killed by the upholders of the capitalist system.The Socialist had been clean-shaven--this man
wore beard and moustache--but Barrington was certain he was the same.When the man had concluded his speech he got down and stood in the
shade behind the platform, while someone else addressed the meeting,
and Barrington went round to where he was standing, intending to speak
to him.They were in the
vicinity of the Slave Market, near the Fountain, on the Grand Parade,
where several roads met; there was a meeting going on at every corner,
and a number of others in different parts of the roadway and on the
pavement of the Parade.Some of these meetings were being carried on by
two or three men, who spoke in turn from small, portable platforms they
carried with them, and placed wherever they thought there was a chance
of getting an audience.Every now and then some of these poor wretches--they were all paid
speakers--were surrounded and savagely mauled and beaten by a hostile
crowd.If they were Tariff Reformers the Liberals mobbed them, and
vice versa.Lines of rowdies swaggered to and fro, arm in arm,
singing, 'Vote, Vote, Vote, for good ole Closeland' or 'good ole
Sweater', according as they were green or blue and yellow.Gangs of
hooligans paraded up and down, armed with sticks, singing, howling,
cursing and looking for someone to hit.Others stood in groups on the
pavement with their hands thrust in their pockets, or leaned against
walls or the shutters of the shops with expressions of ecstatic
imbecility on their faces, chanting the mournful dirge to the tune of
the church chimes,

        'Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er.'Other groups--to the same tune--sang 'Good--ole--Close--land'; and
every now and again they used to leave off singing and begin to beat
each other.Fights used to take place, often between workmen, about
the respective merits of Adam Sweater and Sir Graball D'Encloseland.The walls were covered with huge Liberal and Tory posters, which showed
in every line the contempt of those who published them for the
intelligence of the working men to whom they were addressed.There was
one Tory poster that represented the interior of a public house; in
front of the bar, with a quart pot in his hand, a clay pipe in his
mouth, and a load of tools on his back, stood a degraded-looking brute
who represented the Tory ideal of what an Englishman should be; the
letterpress on the poster said it was a man!This is the ideal of
manhood that they hold up to the majority of their fellow countrymen,
but privately--amongst themselves--the Tory aristocrats regard such
'men' with far less respect than they do the lower animals.They were more
cunning, more specious, more hypocritical and consequently more
calculated to mislead and deceive the more intelligent of the voters.When Barrington got round to the back of the platform, he found the man
with the scarred face standing alone and gloomily silent in the shadow.Barrington gave him one of the Socialist leaflets, which he took, and
after glancing at it, put it in his coat pocket without making any
remark.'I hope you'll excuse me for asking, but were you not formerly a
Socialist?'Even in the semi-darkness Barrington saw the other man flush deeply and
then become very pale, and the unsightly scar upon his forehead showed
with ghastly distinctiveness.'I am still a Socialist: no man who has once been a Socialist can ever
cease to be one.''You seem to have accomplished that impossibility, to judge by the work
you are at present engaged in.You must have changed your opinions
since you were here last.''No one who has been a Socialist can ever cease to be one.It is
impossible for a man who has once acquired knowledge ever to relinquish
it.A Socialist is one who understands the causes of the misery and
degradation we see all around us; who knows the only remedy, and knows
that that remedy--the state of society that will be called
Socialism--must eventually be adopted; is the only alternative to the
extermination of the majority of the working people; but it does not
follow that everyone who has sense enough to acquire that amount of
knowledge, must, in addition, be willing to sacrifice himself in order
to help to bring that state of society into being.When I first
acquired that knowledge,' he continued, bitterly, 'I was eager to tell
the good news to others.I sacrificed my time, my money, and my health
in order that I might teach others what I had learned myself.I did it
willingly and happily, because I thought they would be glad to hear,
and that they were worth the sacrifices I made for their sakes.'Even if you no longer believe in working for Socialism, there's no
need to work AGAINST it.If you are not disposed to sacrifice yourself
in order to do good to others, you might at least refrain from doing
evil.If you don't want to help to bring about a better state of
affairs, there's no reason why you should help to perpetuate the
present system.''Oh yes, there is, and a very good
reason too.''I don't think you could show me a reason,' said Barrington.The man with the scar laughed again, the same unpleasant, mirthless
laugh, and thrusting his hand into his trouser pocket drew it out again
full of silver coins, amongst which one or two gold pieces glittered.When I devoted my life and what abilities I
possess to the service of my fellow workmen; when I sought to teach
them how to break their chains; when I tried to show them how they
might save their children from poverty and shameful servitude, I did
not want them to give me money.And they paid me
with hatred and injury.But since I have been helping their masters to
rob them, they have treated me with respect.'Barrington made no reply and the other man, having returned the money
to his pocket, indicated the crowd with a sweep of his hand.the people you are trying to make idealists of!Some of
them howling and roaring like wild beasts, or laughing like idiots,
others standing with dull and stupid faces devoid of any trace of
intelligence or expression, listening to the speakers whose words
convey no meaning to their stultified minds, and others with their eyes
gleaming with savage hatred of their fellow men, watching eagerly for
an opportunity to provoke a quarrel that they may gratify their brutal
natures by striking someone--their eyes are hungry for the sight of
blood!Can't you see that these people, whom you are trying to make
understand your plan for the regeneration of the world, your doctrine
of universal brotherhood and love are for the most
part--intellectually--on a level with Hottentots?The only things they
feel any real interest in are beer, football, betting and--of
course--one other subject.Their highest ambition is to be allowed to
Work.'They have never had an independent thought in their lives.These are
the people whom you hope to inspire with lofty ideals!You might just
as well try to make a gold brooch out of a lump of dung!Try to reason
with them, to uplift them, to teach them the way to higher things.Devote your whole life and intelligence to the work of trying to get
better conditions for them, and you will find that they themselves are
the enemy you will have to fight against.They'll hate you, and, if
they get the chance, they'll tear you to pieces.But if you're a
sensible man you'll use whatever talents and intelligence you possess
for your own benefit.Don't think about Socialism or any other "ism".Concentrate your mind on getting money--it doesn't matter how you get
it, but--get it.If you can't get it honestly, get it dishonestly, but
get it!and then they'll have some respect for you.''There's something in what you say,' replied Barrington, after a long
pause, 'but it's not all.Circumstances make us what we are; and
anyhow, the children are worth fighting for.''You may think so now,' said the other, 'but you'll come to see it my
way some day.As for the children--if their parents are satisfied to
let them grow up to be half-starved drudges for other people, I don't
see why you or I need trouble about it.If you like to listen to
reason,' he continued after a pause, 'I can put you on to something
that will be worth more to you than all your Socialism.''Look here: you're a Socialist; well, I'm a Socialist too: that is, I
have sense enough to believe that Socialism is practical and inevitable
and right; it will come when the majority of the people are
sufficiently enlightened to demand it, but that enlightenment will
never be brought about by reasoning or arguing with them, for these
people are simply not intellectually capable of abstract
reasoning--they can't grasp theories.You know what the late Lord
Salisbury said about them when somebody proposed to give them some free
libraries: He said: "They don't want libraries: give them a circus."You see these Liberals and Tories understand the sort of people they
have to deal with; they know that although their bodies are the bodies
of grown men, their minds are the minds of little children.That is
why it has been possible to deceive and bluff and rob them for so long.But your party persists in regarding them as rational beings, and
that's where you make a mistake--you're simply wasting your time.'The only way in which it is possible to teach these people is by means
of object lessons, and those are being placed before them in increasing
numbers every day.The trustification of industry--the object lesson
which demonstrates the possibility of collective ownership--will in
time compel even these to understand, and by the time they have learnt
that, they will also have learned by bitter experience and not from
theoretical teaching, that they must either own the trusts or perish,
and then, and not, till then, they will achieve Socialism.Do you think it will make any real
difference--for good or evil--which of these two men is elected?''Well, you can't keep them both out--you have no candidate of your
own--why should you object to earning a few pounds by helping one of
them to get in?There are plenty of voters who are doubtful what to
do; as you and I know there is every excuse for them being unable to
make up their minds which of these two candidates is the worse, a word
from your party would decide them.Since you have no candidate of your
own you will be doing no harm to Socialism and you will be doing
yourself a bit of good.If you like to come along with me now, I'll
introduce you to Sweater's agent--no one need know anything about it.'He slipped his arm through Barrington's, but the latter released
himself.'Please yourself,' said the other with an affectation of indifference.You may choose to be a Jesus Christ
if you like, but for my part I'm finished.For the future I intend to
look after myself.As for these people--they vote for what they want;
they get--what they vote for; and by God, they deserve nothing better!They are being beaten with whips of their own choosing and if I had my
way they should be chastised with scorpions!For them, the present
system means joyless drudgery, semi-starvation, rags and premature
death.Well, let them have what
they vote for--let them drudge--let them starve!'The man with the scarred face ceased speaking, and for some moments
Barrington did not reply.'I suppose there is some excuse for your feeling as you do,' he said
slowly at last, 'but it seems to me that you do not make enough
allowance for the circumstances.From their infancy most of them have
been taught by priests and parents to regard themselves and their own
class with contempt--a sort of lower animals--and to regard those who
possess wealth with veneration, as superior beings.The idea that they
are really human creatures, naturally absolutely the same as their
so-called betters, naturally equal in every way, naturally different
from them only in those ways in which their so-called superiors differ
from each other, and inferior to them only because they have been
deprived of education, culture and opportunity--you know as well as I
do that they have all been taught to regard that idea as preposterous.'The self-styled "Christian" priests who say--with their tongues in
their cheeks--that God is our Father and that all men are brethren,
have succeeded in convincing the majority of the "brethren" that it is
their duty to be content in their degradation, and to order themselves
lowly and reverently towards their masters.Your resentment should be
directed against the deceivers, not against the dupes.''Well, go and try to undeceive them,' he said, as he returned to the
platform in response to a call from his associates.'Go and try to
teach them that the Supreme Being made the earth and all its fullness
for the use and benefit of all His children.Go and try to explain to
them that they are poor in body and mind and social condition, not
because of any natural inferiority, but because they have been robbed
of their inheritance.Go and try to show them how to secure that
inheritance for themselves and their children--and see how grateful
they'll be to you.'For the next hour Barrington walked about the crowded streets in a
dispirited fashion.His conversation with the renegade seemed to have
taken all the heart out of him.He still had a number of the leaflets,
but the task of distributing them had suddenly grown distasteful and
after a while he discontinued it.Like
one awakened from a dream he saw the people who surrounded him in a
different light.For the first time he properly appreciated the
offensiveness of most of those to whom he offered the handbills; some,
without even troubling to ascertain what they were about, rudely
refused to accept them; some took them and after glancing at the
printing, crushed them in their hands and ostentatiously threw them
away.Others, who recognized him as a Socialist, angrily or
contemptuously declined them, often with curses or injurious words.His attention was presently attracted to a crowd of about thirty or
forty people, congregated near a gas lamp at the roadside.The sound
of many angry voices rose from the centre of this group, and as he
stood on the outskirts of the crowd, Barrington, being tall, was able
to look into the centre, where he saw Owen.The light of the street
lamp fell full upon the latter's pale face, as he stood silent in the
midst of a ring of infuriated men, who were all howling at him at once,
and whose malignant faces bore expressions of savage hatred, as they
shouted out the foolish accusations and slanders they had read in the
Liberal and Tory papers.Socialists wished to do away with religion and morality!All the money that the working classes had
saved up in the Post Office and the Friendly Societies, was to be
Robbed from them and divided up amongst a lot of drunken loafers who
were too lazy to work.The King and all the Royal Family were to be
Done Away with!Owen made no attempt to reply, and the manner of the crowd became every
moment more threatening.It was evident that several of them found it
difficult to refrain from attacking him.It was a splendid opportunity
of doing a little fighting without running any risks.This fellow was
all by himself, and did not appear to be much of a man even at that.Those in the middle were encouraged by shouts from others in the crowd,
who urged them to 'Go for him' and at last--almost at the instant of
Barrington's arrival--one of the heroes, unable to contain himself any
longer, lifted a heavy stick and struck Owen savagely across the face.The sight of the blood maddened the others, and in an instant everyone
who could get within striking distance joined furiously in the
onslaught, reaching eagerly over each other's shoulders, showering
blows upon him with sticks and fists, and before Barrington could reach
his side, they had Owen down on the ground, and had begun to use their
boots upon him.Barrington felt like a wild beast himself, as he fiercely fought his
way through the crowd, spurning them to right and left with fists and
elbows.He reached the centre in time to seize the uplifted arm of the
man who had led the attack and wrenching the stick from his hand, he
felled him to the ground with a single blow.The remainder shrank
back, and meantime the crowd was augmented by others who came running
up.Some of these newcomers were Liberals and some Tories, and as these did
not know what the row was about they attacked each other.The Liberals
went for those who wore Tory colours and vice versa, and in a few
seconds there was a general free fight, though most of the original
crowd ran away, and in the confusion that ended, Barrington and Owen
got out of the crowd without further molestation.Monday was the last day of the election--polling day--and in
consequence of the number of motor cars that were flying about, the
streets were hardly safe for ordinary traffic.The wealthy persons who
owned these carriages...

The result of the poll was to be shown on an illuminated sign at the
Town Hall, at eleven o'clock that night, and long before that hour a
vast crowd gathered in the adjacent streets.About ten o'clock it
began to rain, but the crowd stood its ground and increased in numbers
as the time went by.At a quarter to eleven the rain increased to a
terrible downpour, but the people remained waiting to know which hero
had conquered.Eleven o'clock came and an intense silence fell upon
the crowd, whose eyes were fixed eagerly upon the window where the sign
was to be exhibited.To judge by the extraordinary interest displayed
by these people, one might have thought that they expected to reap some
great benefit or to sustain some great loss from the result, but of
course that was not the case, for most of them knew perfectly well that
the result of this election would make no more real difference to them
than all the other elections that had gone before.There were ten thousand
voters on the register.At a quarter past eleven the sign was
illuminated, but the figures were not yet shown.Next, the names of
the two candidates were slid into sight, the figures were still
missing, but D'Encloseland's name was on top, and a hoarse roar of
triumph came from the throats of his admirers.Then the two slides
with the names were withdrawn, and the sign was again left blank.After
a time the people began to murmur at all this delay and messing about,
and presently some of them began to groan and hoot.After a few minutes the names were again slid into view, this time with
Sweater's name on top, and the figures appeared immediately afterwards:

        Sweater.4,221
        D'Encloseland.4,200

It was several seconds before the Liberals could believe their eyes; it
was too good to be true.It is impossible to say what was the reason
of the wild outburst of delighted enthusiasm that followed, but
whatever the reason, whatever the benefit was that they expected to
reap--there was the fact.They were all cheering and dancing and
shaking hands with each other, and some of them were so overcome with
inexplicable joy that they were scarcely able to speak.It was
altogether extraordinary and unaccountable.A few minutes after the declaration, Sweater appeared at the window and
made a sort of a speech, but only fragments of it were audible to the
cheering crowd who at intervals caught such phrases as 'Slashing Blow',
'Sweep the Country', 'Grand Old Liberal Flag', and so on.Next
D'Encloseland appeared and he was seen to shake hands with Mr Sweater,
whom he referred to as 'My friend'.When the two 'friends' disappeared from the window, the part of the
Liberal crowd that was not engaged in hand-to-hand fights with their
enemies--the Tories--made a rush to the front entrance of the Town
Hall, where Sweater's carriage was waiting, and as soon as he had
placed his plump rotundity inside, they took the horses out and amid
frantic cheers harnessed themselves to it instead and dragged it
through the mud and the pouring rain all the way to 'The Cave'--most of
them were accustomed to acting as beasts of burden--where he again
addressed a few words to them from the porch.Afterwards as they walked home saturated with rain and covered from
head to foot with mud, they said it was a great victory for the cause
of progress!Chapter 49

The Undesired


That evening about seven o'clock, whilst Easton was down-town seeing
the last of the election, Ruth's child was born.After the doctor was gone, Mary Linden stayed with her during the hours
that elapsed before Easton came home, and downstairs Elsie and
Charley--who were allowed to stay up late to help their mother because
Mrs Easton was ill--crept about very quietly, and conversed in hushed
tones as they washed up the tea things and swept the floor and tidied
the kitchen.Easton did not return until after midnight, and all through the
intervening hours, Ruth, weak and tired, but unable to sleep, was lying
in bed with the child by her side.Her wide-open eyes appeared
unnaturally large and brilliant, in contrast with the almost death-like
paleness of her face, and there was a look of fear in them, as she
waited and listened for the sound of Easton's footsteps.Outside, the silence of the night was disturbed by many unusual noises:
a far-off roar, as of the breaking of waves on a seashore, arose from
the direction of the town, where the last scenes of the election were
being enacted.Every few minutes motor cars rushed past the house at a
furious rate, and the air was full of the sounds of distant shouts and
singing.Ruth listened and started nervously at every passing footstep.Those
who can imagine the kind of expression there would be upon the face of
a hunted thief, who, finding himself encompassed and brought to bay by
his pursuers, looks wildly around in a vain search for some way of
escape, may be able to form some conception of the terror-stricken way
in which she listened to every sound that penetrated into the stillness
of the dimly lighted room.And ever and again, when her wandering
glance reverted to the frail atom of humanity nestling by her side, her
brows contracted and her eyes filled with bitter tears, as she weakly
reached out her trembling hand to adjust its coverings, faintly
murmuring, with quivering lips and a bursting heart, some words of
endearment and pity.And then--alarmed by the footsteps of some chance
passerby, or by the closing of the door of a neighbouring house, and
fearing that it was the sound she had been waiting for and dreading
through all those weary hours, she would turn in terror to Mary Linden,
sitting in the chair at the bedside, sewing by the light of the shaded
lamp, and take hold of her arm as if seeking protection from some
impending danger.It was after twelve o'clock when Easton came home.Ruth recognized his
footsteps before he reached the house, and her heart seemed to stop
beating when she heard the clang of the gate, as it closed after he had
passed through.It had been Mary's intention to withdraw before he came into the room,
but the sick woman clung to her in such evident fear, and entreated her
so earnestly not to go away, that she remained.It was with a feeling of keen disappointment that Easton noticed how
Ruth shrank away from him, for he had expected and hoped, that after
this, they would be good friends once more; but he tried to think that
it was because she was ill, and when she would not let him touch the
child lest he should awaken it, he agreed without question.The next day, and for the greater part of the time during the next
fortnight, Ruth was in a raging fever.There were intervals when
although weak and exhausted, she was in her right mind, but most of the
time she was quite unconscious of her surroundings and often delirious.Mrs Owen came every day to help to look after her, because Mary just
then had a lot of needlework to do, and consequently could only give
part of her time to Ruth, who, in her delirium, lived and told over and
over again all the sorrow and suffering of the last few months.And so
the two friends, watching by her bedside, learned her dreadful secret.Sometimes--in her delirium--she seemed possessed of an intense and
terrible loathing for the poor little creature she had brought into the
world, and was with difficulty prevented from doing it violence.Once
she seized it cruelly and threw it fiercely from her to the foot of the
bed, as if it had been some poisonous or loathsome thing.And so it
often became necessary to take the child away out of the room, so that
she could not see or hear it, but when her senses came back to her, her
first thought was for the child, and there must have been in her mind
some faint recollection of what she had said and done in her madness,
for when she saw that the baby was not in its accustomed place her
distress and alarm were painful to see, as she entreated them with
tears to give it back to her.And then she would kiss and fondle it
with all manner of endearing words, and cry bitterly.Easton did not see or hear most of this; he only knew that she was very
ill; for he went out every day on the almost hopeless quest for work.Rushton's had next to nothing to do, and most of the other shops were
in a similar plight.Dauber and Botchit had one or two jobs going on,
and Easton tried several times to get a start for them, but was always
told they were full up.The sweating methods of this firm continued to
form a favourite topic of conversation with the unemployed workmen, who
railed at and cursed them horribly.It had leaked out that they were
paying only sixpence an hour to most of the skilled workmen in their
employment, and even then the conditions under which they worked were,
if possible, worse than those obtaining at most other firms.The men
were treated like so many convicts, and every job was a hell where
driving and bullying reigned supreme, and obscene curses and blasphemy
polluted the air from morning till night.The resentment of those who
were out of work was directed, not only against the heads of the firm,
but also against the miserable, half-starved drudges in their
employment.These poor wretches were denounced as'scabs' and
'wastrels' by the unemployed workmen but all the same, whenever Dauber
and Botchit wanted some extra hands they never had any difficulty in
obtaining them, and it often happened that those who had been loudest
and bitterest in their denunciations were amongst the first to rush off
eagerly to apply there for a job whenever there was a chance of getting
one.Frequently the light was seen burning late at night in Rushton's
office, where Nimrod and his master were figuring out prices and
writing out estimates, cutting down the amounts to the lowest possible
point in the hope of underbidding their rivals.Now and then they were
successful but whether they secured the work or not, Nimrod always
appeared equally miserable.If they got the 'job' it often showed such
a small margin of profit that Rushton used to grumble at him and
suggest mismanagement.If their estimates were too high and they lost
the work, he used to demand of Nimrod why it was possible for Dauber
and Botchit to do work so much more cheaply.As the unemployed workmen stood in groups at the corners or walked
aimlessly about the streets, they often saw Hunter pass by on his
bicycle, looking worried and harassed.He was such a picture of
misery, that it began to be rumoured amongst the men, that he had never
been the same since the time he had that fall off the bike; and some of
them declared, that they wouldn't mind betting that ole Misery would
finish up by going off his bloody rocker.At intervals--whenever a job came in--Owen, Crass, Slyme, Sawkins and
one or two others, continued to be employed at Rushton's, but they
seldom managed to make more than two or three days a week, even when
there was anything to do.Chapter 50

Sundered


During the next few weeks Ruth continued very ill.Although the
delirium had left her and did not return, her manner was still very
strange, and it was remarkable that she slept but little and at long
intervals.Mrs Owen came to look after her every day, not going back
to her own home till the evening.Frankie used to call for her as he
came out of school and then they used to go home together, taking
little Freddie Easton with them also, for his own mother was not able
to look after him and Mary Linden had so much other work to do.On Wednesday evening, when the child was about five weeks old, as Mrs
Owen was wishing her good night, Ruth took hold of her hand and after
saying how grateful she was for all that she had done, she asked
whether--supposing anything happened to herself--Nora would promise to
take charge of Freddie for Easton.Owen's wife gave the required
promise, at the same time affecting to regard the supposition as
altogether unlikely, and assuring her that she would soon be better,
but she secretly wondered why Ruth had not mentioned the other child as
well.Nora went away about five o'clock, leaving Ruth's bedroom door open so
that Mrs Linden could hear her call if she needed anything.About a
quarter of an hour after Nora and the two children had gone, Mary
Linden went upstairs to see Ruth, who appeared to have fallen fast
asleep; so she returned to her needlework downstairs.The weather had
been very cloudy all day, there had been rain at intervals and it was a
dark evening, so dark that she had to light the lamp to see her work.Charley sat on the hearthrug in front of the fire repairing one of the
wheels of a wooden cart that he had made with the assistance of another
boy, and Elsie busied herself preparing the tea.Easton was not yet home; Rushton & Co.had a few jobs to do and he had
been at work since the previous Thursday.The place where he was
working was some considerable distance away, so it was nearly half past
six when he came home.They heard him at the gate and at her mother's
direction Elsie went quickly to the front door, which was ajar, to ask
him to walk as quietly as possible so as not to wake Ruth.Mary had prepared the table for his tea in the kitchen, where there was
a bright fire with the kettle singing on the hob.He lit the lamp and
after removing his hat and overcoat, put the kettle on the fire and
while he was waiting for it to boil he went softly upstairs.There was
no lamp burning in the bedroom and the place would have been in utter
darkness but for the red glow of the fire, which did not dispel the
prevailing obscurity sufficiently to enable him to discern the
different objects in the room distinctly.The intense silence that
reigned struck him with a sudden terror.He crossed swiftly over to
the bed and a moment's examination sufficed to tell him that it was
empty.He called her name, but there was no answer, and a hurried
search only made it certain that she was nowhere in the house.Mrs Linden now remembered what Owen's wife had told her of the strange
request that Ruth had made, and as she recounted it to Easton, his
fears became intensified a thousandfold.He was unable to form any
opinion of the reason of her going or of where she had gone, as he
rushed out to seek for her.Almost unconsciously he directed his steps
to Owen's house, and afterwards the two men went to every place where
they thought it possible she might have gone, but without finding any
trace of her.Her father lived a short distance outside the town, and this was one of
the first places they went to, although Easton did not think it likely
she would go there, for she had not been on friendly terms with her
stepmother, and as he had anticipated, it was a fruitless journey.They sought for her in every conceivable place, returning often to
Easton's house to see if she had come home, but they found no trace of
her, nor met anyone who had seen her, which was, perhaps, because the
dreary, rain-washed streets were deserted by all except those whose
business compelled them to be out.About eleven o'clock Nora was standing at the front door waiting for
Owen and Easton, when she thought she could discern a woman's figure in
the shadow of the piers of the gate opposite.It was an unoccupied
house with a garden in front, and the outlines of the bushes it
contained were so vague in the darkness that it was impossible to be
certain; but the longer she looked the more convinced she became that
there was someone there.At last she summoned sufficient courage to
cross over the road, and as she nervously drew near the gate it became
evident that she had not been mistaken.There was a woman standing
there--a woman with a child in her arms, leaning against one of the
pillars and holding the iron bars of the gate with her left hand.Nora recognized her even in the semi-darkness.Her attitude
was one of extreme exhaustion, and as Nora touched her, she perceived
that she was wet through and trembling; but although she was almost
fainting with fatigue she would not consent to go indoors until
repeatedly assured that Easton was not there, and that Nora would not
let him see her if he came.And when at length she yielded and went
into the house she would not sit down or take off her hat or jacket
until--crouching on the floor beside Nora's chair with her face hidden
in the latter's lap--she had sobbed out her pitiful confession, the
same things that she had unwittingly told to the same hearer so often
before during the illness, the only fact that was new was the account
of her wanderings that night.She cried so bitterly and looked so forlorn and heartbroken and ashamed
as she faltered out her woeful story; so consumed with
self-condemnation, making no excuse for herself except to repeat over
and over again that she had never meant to do wrong, that Nora could
not refrain from weeping also as she listened.It appeared that, unable to bear the reproach that Easton's presence
seemed to imply, or to endure the burden of her secret any longer, and
always haunted by the thought of the lake in the park, Ruth had formed
the dreadful resolution of taking her own life and the child's.When
she arrived at the park gates they were closed and locked for the night
but she remembered that there was another means of entering--the place
at the far end of the valley where the park was not fenced in, so she
had gone there--nearly three miles--only to find that railings had
recently been erected and therefore it was no longer possible to get
into the park by that way.And then, when she found it impossible to
put her resolve into practice, she had realized for the first time the
folly and wickedness of the act she had meant to commit.But although
she had abandoned her first intention, she said she could never go home
again; she would take a room somewhere and get some work to do, or
perhaps she might be able to get a situation where they would allow her
to have the child with her, or failing that she would work and pay
someone to look after it; but she could never go home any more.If she
only had somewhere to stay for a few days until she could get something
to do, she was sure she would be able to earn her living, but she could
not go back home; she felt that she would rather walk about the streets
all night than go there again.It was arranged that Ruth should have the small apartment which had
been Frankie's playroom, the necessary furniture being obtained from a
second-hand shop close by.Easton did not learn the real reason of her
flight until three days afterwards.At first he attributed it to a
recurrence of the mental disorder that she had suffered from after the
birth of the child, and he had been glad to leave her at Owen's place
in Nora's care, but on the evening of the third day when he returned
home from work, he found a letter in Ruth's handwriting which told him
all there was to tell.When he recovered from the stupefaction into which he was thrown by the
perusal of this letter, his first thought was to seek out Slyme, but he
found upon inquiring that the latter had left the town the previous
morning.Slyme's landlady said he had told her that he had been
offered several months' work in London, which he had accepted.The
truth was that Slyme had heard of Ruth's flight--nearly everyone knew
about it as a result of the inquiries that had been made for her--and,
guessing the cause, he had prudently cleared out.Easton made no attempt to see Ruth, but he went to Owen's and took
Freddie away, saying he would pay Mrs Linden to look after the child
whilst he was at work.His manner was that of a deeply injured
man--the possibility that he was in any way to blame for what had
happened did not seem to occur to his mind at all.As for Ruth she made no resistance to his taking the child away from
her, although she cried about it in secret.She got some work a few
days afterwards--helping the servants at one of the large
boarding-houses on the Grand Parade.Nora looked after the baby for her while she was at work, an
arrangement that pleased Frankie vastly; he said it was almost as good
as having a baby of their very own.For the first few weeks after Ruth went away Easton tried to persuade
himself that he did not very much regret what had happened.Mrs Linden
looked after Freddie, and Easton tried to believe that he would really
be better off now that he had only himself and the child to provide for.At first, whenever he happened to meet Owen, they used to speak of
Ruth, or to be more correct, Easton used to speak of her; but one day
when the two men were working together Owen had expressed himself
rather offensively.He seemed to think that Easton was more to blame
than she was; and afterwards they avoided the subject, although Easton
found it difficult to avoid the thoughts the other man's words
suggested.Now and then he heard of Ruth and learnt that she was still working at
the same place; and once he met her suddenly and unexpectedly in the
street.They passed each other hurriedly and he did not see the
scarlet flush that for an instant dyed her face, nor the deathly pallor
that succeeded it.He never went to Owen's place or sent any communication to Ruth, nor
did she ever send him any; but although Easton did not know it she
frequently saw Freddie, for when Elsie Linden took the child out she
often called to see Mrs Owen.As time went on and the resentment he had felt towards her lost its
first bitterness, Easton began to think there was perhaps some little
justification for what Owen had said, and gradually there grew within
him an immense desire for reconciliation--to start afresh and to forget
all that had happened; but the more he thought of this the more
hopeless and impossible of realization it seemed.Although perhaps he was not conscious of it, this desire arose solely
from selfish motives.The money he earned seemed to melt away almost
as soon as he received it; to his surprise he found that he was not
nearly so well off in regard to personal comfort as he had been
formerly, and the house seemed to grow more dreary and desolate as the
wintry days dragged slowly by.Sometimes--when he had the money--he
sought forgetfulness in the society of Crass and the other frequenters
of the Cricketers, but somehow or other he could not take the same
pleasure in the conversation of these people as formerly, when he had
found it--as he now sometimes wondered to remember--so entertaining as
to almost make him forget Ruth's existence.One evening about three weeks before Christmas, as he and Owen were
walking homewards together from work, Easton reverted for the first
time to their former conversation.He spoke with a superior air: his
manner and tone indicating that he thought he was behaving with great
generosity.He would be willing to forgive her and have her back, he
said, if she would come: but he would never be able to tolerate the
child.Of course it might be sent to an orphanage or some similar
institution, but he was afraid Ruth would never consent to that, and he
knew that her stepmother would not take it.'If you can persuade her to return to you, we'll take the child,' said
Owen.'Do you think your wife would be willing?'We thought it a possible way for you, and my wife would
like to have the child.''But would you be able to afford it?''Of course,' said Easton, 'if Slyme comes back he might agree to pay
something for its keep.'After a long pause Easton continued: 'Would you mind asking Mrs Owen to
suggest it to Ruth?''If you like I'll get her to suggest it--as a message from you.''What I meant,' said Easton hesitatingly, 'was that your wife might
just suggest it--casual like--and advise her that it would be the best
way, and then you could let me know what Ruth said.''No,' replied Owen, unable any longer to control his resentment of the
other's manner, 'as things stand now, if it were not for the other
child, I should advise her to have nothing further to do with you.You
seem to think that you are acting a very generous part in being
"willing" to have her back, but she's better off now than she was with
you.I see no reason--except for the other child--why she should go
back to you.As far as I understand it, you had a good wife and you
ill-treated her.'I never raised my hand to her--at least only
once, and then I didn't hurt her.'Oh no: from what my wife tells me she only blames herself, but I'm
drawing my own conclusions.You may not have struck her, but you did
worse--you treated her with indifference and exposed her to temptation.What has happened is the natural result of your neglect and want of
care for her.The responsibility for what has happened is mainly
yours, but apparently you wish to pose now as being very generous and
to "forgive her"--you're "willing" to take her back; but it seems to me
that it would be more fitting that you should ask her to forgive you.'Easton made no answer and after a long silence the other continued:

'I would not advise her to go back to you on such terms as you seem to
think right, because if you became reconciled on such terms I don't
think either of you could be happy.Your only chance of happiness is
to realize that you have both done wrong; that each of you has
something to forgive; to forgive and never speak of it again.'Easton made no reply and a few minutes afterwards, their ways
diverging, they wished each other 'Good night'.They were working for Rushton--painting the outside of a new
conservatory at Mr Sweater's house, 'The Cave'.This job was finished
the next day and at four o'clock the boy brought the handcart, which
they loaded with their ladders and other materials.They took these
back to the yard and then, as it was Friday night, they went up to the
front shop and handed in their time sheets.Afterwards, as they were
about to separate, Easton again referred to the subject of their
conversation of the previous evening.He had been very reserved and
silent all day, scarcely uttering a word except when the work they had
been engaged in made it necessary to do so, and there was now a sort of
catch in his voice as he spoke.'I've been thinking over what you said last night; it's quite true.I wrote to Ruth last night and
admitted it to her.I'll take it as a favour if you and your wife will
say what you can to help me get her back.'Owen stretched out his hand and as the other took it, said: 'You may
rely on us both to do our best.'Chapter 51

The Widow's Son


The next morning when they went to the yard at half past eight o'clock
Hunter told them that there was nothing to do, but that they had better
come on Monday in case some work came in.They accordingly went on the
Monday, and Tuesday and Wednesday, but as nothing 'came in' of course
they did not do any work.On Thursday morning the weather was dark and
bitterly cold.The sky presented an unbroken expanse of dull grey and
a keen north wind swept through the cheerless streets.Owen--who had
caught cold whilst painting the outside of the conservatory at
Sweater's house the previous week--did not get to the yard until ten
o'clock.He felt so ill that he would not have gone at all if they had
not needed the money he would be able to earn if there was anything to
do.Strange though it may appear to the advocates of thrift, although
he had been so fortunate as to be in employment when so many others
were idle, they had not saved any money.On the contrary, during all
the summer they had not been able to afford to have proper food or
clothing.Every week most of the money went to pay arrears of rent or
some other debts, so that even whilst he was at work they had often to
go without some of the necessaries of life.They had broken boots,
shabby, insufficient clothing, and barely enough to eat.The weather had become so bitterly cold that, fearing he would be laid
up if he went without it any longer, he took his overcoat out of pawn,
and that week they had to almost starve.Not that it was much better
other weeks, for lately he had only been making six and a half hours a
day--from eight-thirty in the morning till four o'clock in the evening,
and on Saturday only four and a half hours--from half past eight till
one.This made his wages--at sevenpence an hour--twenty-one shillings
and sevenpence a week--that is, when there was work to do every day,
which was not always.Sometimes they had to stand idle three days out
of six.The wages of those who got sixpence halfpenny came out at one
pound and twopence--when they worked every day--and as for those
who--like Sawkins--received only fivepence, their week's wages amounted
to fifteen and sixpence.When they were only employed for two or three days or perhaps only a
few hours, their 'Saturday night' sometimes amounted to half a
sovereign, seven and sixpence, five shillings or even less.Then most
of them said that it was better than nothing at all.Many of them were married men, so, in order to make existence possible,
their wives went out charing or worked in laundries.They had children
whom they had to bring up for the most part on'skim' milk, bread,
margarine, and adulterated tea.Many of these children--little mites
of eight or nine years--went to work for two or three hours in the
morning before going to school; the same in the evening after school,
and all day on Saturday, carrying butchers' trays loaded with meat,
baskets of groceries and vegetables, cans of paraffin oil, selling or
delivering newspapers, and carrying milk.As soon as they were old
enough they got Half Time certificates and directly they were fourteen
they left school altogether and went to work all the day.When they
were old enough some of them tried to join the Army or Navy, but were
found physically unfit.It is not much to be wondered at that when they became a little older
they were so degenerate intellectually that they imagined that the
surest way to obtain better conditions would be to elect gangs of
Liberal and Tory land-grabbers, sweaters, swindlers and lawyers to rule
over them.When Owen arrived at the yard he found Bert White cleaning out the
dirty pots in the paint-shop.The noise he made with the scraping
knife prevented him from hearing Owen's approach and the latter stood
watching him for some minutes without speaking.The stone floor of the
paint shop was damp and shiny and the whole place was chilly as a tomb.The boy was trembling with cold and he looked pitifully undersized and
frail as he bent over his work with an old apron girt about him.Because it was so cold he was wearing his jacket with the ends of the
sleeves turned back to keep them clean, or to prevent them getting any
dirtier, for they were already in the same condition as the rest of his
attire, which was thickly encrusted with dried paint of many colours,
and his hands and fingernails were grimed with it.As he watched the poor boy bending over his task, Owen thought of
Frankie, and with a feeling akin to terror wondered whether he would
ever be in a similar plight.When he saw Owen, the boy left off working and wished him good morning,
remarking that it was very cold.There's lots of wood lying about the
yard.'Misery
wouldn't 'arf ramp if 'e caught me at it.I used to 'ave a fire 'ere
last winter till Rushton found out, and 'e kicked up an orful row and
told me to move meself and get some work done and then I wouldn't feel
the cold.''Oh, he said that, did he?'said Owen, his pale face becoming suddenly
suffused with blood.He went out into the yard and crossing over to where--under a
shed--there was a great heap of waste wood, stuff that had been taken
out of places where Rushton & Co.had made alterations, he gathered an
armful of it and was returning to the paintshop when Sawkins accosted
him.'You mustn't go burnin' any of that, you know!That's all got to be
saved and took up to the bloke's house.Misery spoke about it only
this mornin'.'He carried the wood into the shop and after
throwing it into the fireplace he poured some old paint over it, and,
applying a match, produced a roaring fire.Then he brought in several
more armfuls of wood and piled them in a corner of the shop.Bert took
no part in these proceedings, and at first rather disapproved of them
because he was afraid there would be trouble when Misery came, but when
the fire was an accomplished fact he warmed his hands and shifted his
work to the other side of the bench so as to get the benefit of the
heat.Owen waited for about half an hour to see if Hunter would return, but
as that disciple did not appear, he decided not to wait any longer.Before leaving he gave Bert some instructions:

'Keep up the fire with all the old paint that you can scrape off those
things and any other old paint or rubbish that's here, and whenever it
grows dull put more wood on.There's a lot of old stuff here that's of
no use except to be thrown away or burnt.If Hunter says
anything, tell him that I lit the fire, and that I told you to keep it
burning.If you want more wood, go out and take it.'On his way out Owen spoke to Sawkins.His manner was so menacing, his
face so pale, and there was such a strange glare in his eyes, that the
latter thought of the talk there had been about Owen being mad, and
felt half afraid of him.'I am going to the office to see Rushton; if Hunter comes here, you say
I told you to tell him that if I find the boy in that shop again
without a fire, I'll report it to the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children.And as for you, if the boy comes out here to get
more wood, don't you attempt to interfere with him.''I don't want to interfere with the bloody kid,' grunted Sawkins.'It
seems to me as if he's gorn orf 'is bloody crumpet,' he added as he
watched Owen walking rapidly down the street.'I can't understand why
people can't mind their own bloody business: anyone would think the boy
belonged to 'IM.'That was just how the matter presented itself to Owen.The idea that
it was his own child who was to be treated in this way possessed and
infuriated him as he strode savagely along.In the vicinity of the
Slave Market on the Grand Parade he passed--without seeing
them--several groups of unemployed artisans whom he knew.Some of them
were offended and remarked that he was getting stuck up, but others,
observing how strange he looked, repeated the old prophecy that one of
these days Owen would go out of his mind.As he drew near to his destination large flakes of snow began to fall.He walked so rapidly and was in such a fury that by the time he reached
the shop he was scarcely able to speak.'Is--Hunter--or Rushton here?''Hunter isn't, but the guv'nor is.'He'll soon--know--that,' panted Owen as he strode up to the office
door, and without troubling to knock, flung it violently open and
entered.The atmosphere of this place was very different from that of the damp
cellar where Bert was working.A grate fitted with asbestos blocks and
lit with gas communicated a genial warmth to the air.Rushton was standing leaning over Miss Wade's chair with his left arm
round her neck.Owen recollected afterwards that her dress was
disarranged.She retired hastily to the far end of the room as Rushton
jumped away from her, and stared in amazement and confusion at the
intruder--he was too astonished and embarrassed to speak.Owen stood
panting and quivering in the middle of the office and pointed a
trembling finger at his employer:

'I've come--here--to tell--you--that--if I find young--Bert
White--working--down in that shop--without a fire--I'll have you
prosecuted.The place is not good enough for a stable--if you owned a
valuable dog--you wouldn't keep it there--I give you fair warning--I
know--enough--about you--to put you--where you deserve to be--if you
don't treat him better I'll have you punished I'll show you up.'Rushton continued to stare at him in mingled confusion, fear and
perplexity; he did not yet comprehend exactly what it was all about; he
was guiltily conscious of so many things which he might reasonably fear
to be shown up or prosecuted for if they were known, and the fact of
being caught under such circumstances with Miss Wade helped to reduce
him to a condition approaching terror.'If the boy has been there without a fire, I 'aven't known anything
about it,' he stammered at last.'Mr 'Unter has charge of all those
matters.''You--yourself--forbade him--to make a fire last winter--and
anyhow--you know about it now.You obtained money from his mother
under the pretence--that you were going--to teach him a trade--but for
the last twelve months--you have been using him--as if he were--a beast
of burden.I advise you to see to it--or I shall--find--means--to make
you--wish you had done so.'With this Owen turned and went out, leaving the door open, and Rushton
in a state of mind compounded of fear, amazement and anger.As he walked homewards through the snow-storm, Owen began to realize
that the consequence of what he had done would be that Rushton would
not give him any more work, and as he reflected on all that this would
mean to those at home, for a moment he doubted whether he had done
right.But when he told Nora what had happened she said there were
plenty of other firms in the town who would employ him--when they had
the work.He had done without Rushton before and could do so again;
for her part--whatever the consequences might be--she was glad that he
had acted as he did.'We'll get through somehow, I suppose,' said Owen, wearily.'There's
not much chance of getting a job anywhere else just now, but I shall
try to get some work on my own account.I shall do some samples of
show-cards the same as I did last winter and try to get orders from
some of the shops--they usually want something extra at this time, but
I'm afraid it is rather too late: most of them already have all they
want.''I shouldn't go out again today if I were you,' said Nora, noticing how
ill he looked.'You should stay at home and read, or write up those
minutes.'The minutes referred to were those of the last meeting of the local
branch of the Painters' Society, of which Owen was the secretary, and
as the snow continued to fall, he occupied himself after dinner in the
manner his wife suggested, until four o'clock, when Frankie returned
from school bringing with him a large snowball, and crying out as a
piece of good news that the snow was still falling heavily, and that he
believed it was freezing!They went to bed very early that night, for it was necessary to
economize the coal, and not only that, but--because the rooms were so
near the roof--it was not possible to keep the place warm no matter how
much coal was used.The fire seemed, if anything, to make the place
colder, for it caused the outer air to pour in through the joints of
the ill-fitting doors and windows.Owen lay awake for the greater part of the night.The terror of the
future made rest or sleep impossible.He got up very early the next
morning--long before it was light--and after lighting the fire, set
about preparing the samples he had mentioned to Nora, but found that it
would not be possible to do much in this direction without buying more
cardboard, for most of what he had was not in good condition.They had bread and butter and tea for breakfast.Frankie had his in
bed and it was decided to keep him away from school until after dinner
because the weather was so very cold and his only pair of boots were so
saturated with moisture from having been out in the snow the previous
day.'I shall make a few inquiries to see if there's any other work to be
had before I buy the cardboard,' said Owen, 'although I'm afraid it's
not much use.'Just as he was preparing to go out, the front door bell rang, and as he
was going down to answer it he saw Bert White coming upstairs.The boy
was carrying a flat, brown-paper parcel under his arm.'A corfin plate,' he explained as he arrived at the door.'Wanted at
once--Misery ses you can do it at 'ome, an' I've got to wait for it.'Owen and his wife looked at each other with intense relief.So he was
not to be dismissed after all.'There's a piece of paper inside the parcel with the name of the party
what's dead,' continued Bert, 'and here's a little bottle of Brunswick
black for you to do the inscription with.''Yes: he told me to tell you there's a job to be started Monday
morning--a couple of rooms to be done out somewhere.Got to be
finished by Thursday; and there's another job 'e wants you to do this
afternoon--after dinner--so you've got to come to the yard at one
o'clock.'E told me to tell you 'e meant to leave a message for you
yesterday morning, but 'e forgot.''What did he say to you about the fire--anything?''Yes: they both of 'em came about an hour after you went away--Misery
and the Bloke too--but they didn't kick up a row.I wasn't arf
frightened, I can tell you, when I saw 'em both coming, but they was
quite nice.The Bloke ses to me, "Ah, that's right, my boy," 'e ses.I'm going to send you some coke," 'e ses.And
then they 'ad a look round and 'e told Sawkins to put some new panes of
glass where the winder was broken, and--you know that great big
packing-case what was under the truck shed?''Well, 'e told Sawkins to saw it up and cover over the stone floor of
the paint-shop with it.It ain't 'arf all right there now.I've
cleared out all the muck from under the benches and we've got two sacks
of coke sent from the gas-works, and the Bloke told me when that's all
used up I've got to get a order orf Miss Wade for another lot.'At one o'clock Owen was at the yard, where he saw Misery, who
instructed him to go to the front shop and paint some numbers on the
racks where the wallpapers were stored.Whilst he was doing this work
Rushton came in and greeted him in a very friendly way.'I'm very glad you let me know about the boy working in that
paint-shop,' he observed after a few preliminary remarks.'I can
assure you as I don't want the lad to be uncomfortable, but you know I
can't attend to everything myself.I'm much obliged to you for telling
me about it; I think you did quite right; I should have done the same
myself.'Owen did not know what to reply, but Rushton walked off without
waiting...



Chapter 52

'It's a Far, Far Better Thing that I do, than I have Ever Done'


Although Owen, Easton and Crass and a few others were so lucky as to
have had a little work to do during the last few months, the majority
of their fellow workmen had been altogether out of employment most of
the time, and meanwhile the practical business-men, and the pretended
disciples of Christ--the liars and hypocrites who professed to believe
that all men are brothers and God their Father--had continued to enact
the usual farce that they called 'Dealing' with the misery that
surrounded them on every side.They continued to organize 'Rummage'
and 'Jumble' sales and bazaars, and to distribute their rotten cast-off
clothes and boots and their broken victuals and soup to such of the
Brethren as were sufficiently degraded to beg for them.The beautiful
Distress Committee was also in full operation; over a thousand Brethren
had registered themselves on its books.Of this number--after careful
investigation--the committee had found that no fewer than six hundred
and seventy-two were deserving of being allowed to work for their
living.The Committee would probably have given these six hundred and
seventy-two the necessary permission, but it was somewhat handicapped
by the fact that the funds at its disposal were only sufficient to
enable that number of Brethren to be employed for about three days.However, by adopting a policy of temporizing, delay, and general artful
dodging, the Committee managed to create the impression that they were
Dealing with the Problem.If it had not been for a cunning device invented by Brother Rushton, a
much larger number of the Brethren would have succeeded in registering
themselves as unemployed on the books of the Committee.In previous
years it had been the practice to issue an application form called a
'Record Paper' to any Brother who asked for one, and the Brother
returned it after filling it in himself.At a secret meeting of the
Committee Rushton proposed--amid laughter and applause, it was such a
good joke--a new and better way, calculated to keep down the number of
applicants.The result of this innovation was that no more forms were
issued, but the applicants for work were admitted into the office one
at a time, and were there examined by a junior clerk, somewhat after
the manner of a French Juge d'Instruction interrogating a criminal, the
clerk filling in the form according to the replies of the culprit.'Where did you live before you went there?''How long were you living at that place?''Did you owe any rent when you left?''What is your Trade, Calling, Employment, or Occupation?''Are you Married or single or a Widower or what?''What kind of a house do you live in?'What have you been doing for the last five years?What kind of work,
how many hours a day?'Give the full names and addresses of all the different employers you
have worked for during the last five years, and the reasons why you
left them?''Give the names of all the foremen you have worked under during the
last five years?''Do you get any money from any Club or Society, or from any Charity, or
from any other source?''Have you ever worked for a Distress Committee before?''Have you ever done any other kinds of work than those you have
mentioned?Do you think you would be fit for any other kind?When the criminal had answered all the questions, and when his answers
had all been duly written down, he was informed that a member of the
Committee, or an Authorized Officer, or some Other Person, would in due
course visit his home and make inquiries about him, after which the
Authorized Officer or Other Person would make a report to the
Committee, who would consider it at their next meeting.As the interrogation of each criminal occupied about half an hour, to
say nothing of the time he was kept waiting, it will be seen that as a
means of keeping down the number of registered unemployed the idea
worked splendidly.When Rushton introduced this new rule it was carried unanimously, Dr
Weakling being the only dissentient, but of course he--as Brother
Grinder remarked--was always opposed to any sensible proposal.There
was one consolation, however, Grinder added, they was not likely to be
pestered with 'im much longer; the first of November was coming and if
he--Grinder--knowed anything of working men they was sure to give
Weakling the dirty kick out directly they got the chance.A few days afterwards the result of the municipal election justified
Brother Grinder's prognostications, for the working men voters of Dr
Weakling's ward did give him the dirty kick out: but Rushton, Didlum,
Grinder and several other members of the band were triumphantly
returned with increased majorities.Mr Dauber, of Dauber and Botchit, had already been elected a Guardian
of the Poor.During all this time Hunter, who looked more worried and miserable as
the dreary weeks went by, was occupied every day in supervising what
work was being done and in running about seeking for more.Nearly
every night he remained at the office until a late hour, poring over
specifications and making out estimates.The police had become so
accustomed to seeing the light in the office that as a rule they took
no notice of it, but one Thursday night--exactly one week after the
scene between Owen and Rushton about the boy--the constable on the beat
observed the light there much later than usual.At first he paid no
particular attention to the fact, but when night merged into morning
and the light still remained, his curiosity was aroused.He knocked at the door, but no one came in answer, and no sound
disturbed the deathlike stillness that reigned within.The door was
locked, but he was not able to tell whether it had been closed from the
inside or outside, because it had a spring latch.The office window
was low down, but it was not possible to see in because the back of the
glass had been painted.The constable thought that the most probable explanation of the mystery
was that whoever had been there earlier in the evening had forgotten to
turn out the light when they went away; it was not likely that thieves
or anyone who had no business to be there would advertise their
presence by lighting the gas.He made a note of the incident in his pocket-book and was about to
resume his beat when he was joined by his inspector.The latter agreed
that the conclusion arrived at by the constable was probably the right
one and they were about to pass on when the inspector noticed a small
speck of light shining through the lower part of the painted window,
where a small piece of the paint had either been scratched or had
shelled off the glass.He knelt down and found that it was possible to
get a view of the interior of the office, and as he peered through he
gave a low exclamation.When he made way for his subordinate to look
in his turn, the constable was with some difficulty able to distinguish
the figure of a man lying prone upon the floor.It was an easy task for the burly policeman to force open the office
door: a single push of his shoulder wrenched it from its fastenings and
as it flew back the socket of the lock fell with a splash into a great
pool of blood that had accumulated against the threshold, flowing from
the place where Hunter was lying on his back, his arms extended and his
head nearly severed from his body.On the floor, close to his right
hand, was an open razor.An overturned chair lay on the floor by the
side of the table where he usually worked, the table itself being
littered with papers and drenched with blood.Within the next few days Crass resumed the role he had played when
Hunter was ill during the summer, taking charge of the work and
generally doing his best to fill the dead man's place, although--as he
confided to certain of his cronies in the bar of the Cricketers--he had
no intention of allowing Rushton to do the same as Hunter had done.One of his first jobs--on the morning after the discovery of the
body--was to go with Mr Rushton to look over a house where some work
was to be done for which an estimate had to be given.It was this
estimate that Hunter had been trying to make out the previous evening
in the office, for they found that the papers on his table were covered
with figures and writing relating to this work.These papers justified
the subsequent verdict of the Coroner's jury that Hunter committed
suicide in a fit of temporary insanity, for they were covered with a
lot of meaningless scribbling, the words wrongly spelt and having no
intelligible connection with each other.There was one sum that he had
evidently tried repeatedly to do correctly, but which came wrong in a
different way every time.The fact that he had the razor in his
possession seemed to point to his having premeditated the act, but this
was accounted for at the inquest by the evidence of the last person who
saw him alive, a hairdresser, who stated that Hunter had left the razor
with him to be sharpened a few days previously and that he had called
for it on the evening of the tragedy.He had ground this razor for Mr
Hunter several times before.Crass took charge of all the arrangements for the funeral.He bought a
new second-hand pair of black trousers at a cast-off clothing shop in
honour of the occasion, and discarded his own low-crowned silk
hat--which was getting rather shabby--in favour of Hunter's tall one,
which he found in the office and annexed without hesitation or scruple.It was rather large for him, but he put some folded strips of paper
inside the leather lining.Crass was a proud man as he walked in
Hunter's place at the head of the procession, trying to look solemn,
but with a half-smile on his fat, pasty face, destitute of colour
except one spot on his chin near his underlip, where there was a small
patch of inflammation about the size of a threepenny piece.This spot
had been there for a very long time.At first--as well as he could
remember--it was only a small pimple, but it had grown larger, with
something the appearance of scurvy.Crass attributed its continuation
to the cold having 'got into it last winter'.It was rather strange,
too, because he generally took care of himself when it was cold: he
always wore the warm wrap that had formerly belonged to the old lady
who died of cancer.However, Crass did not worry much about this
little sore place; he just put a little zinc ointment on it
occasionally and had no doubt that it would get well in time.Chapter 53

Barrington Finds a Situation


The revulsion of feeling that Barrington experienced during the
progress of the election was intensified by the final result.The
blind, stupid, enthusiastic admiration displayed by the philanthropists
for those who exploited and robbed them; their extraordinary apathy
with regard to their own interests; the patient, broken-spirited way in
which they endured their sufferings, tamely submitting to live in
poverty in the midst of the wealth they had helped to create; their
callous indifference to the fate of their children, and the savage
hatred they exhibited towards anyone who dared to suggest the
possibility of better things, forced upon him the thought that the
hopes he cherished were impossible of realization.The words of the
renegade Socialist recurred constantly to his mind:

'You can be a Jesus Christ if you like, but for my part I'm finished.For the future I intend to look after myself.As for these people,
they vote for what they want, they get what they vote for, and, by God!They are being beaten with whips of their
own choosing, and if I had my way they should be chastised with
scorpions.For them, the present system means joyless drudgery,
semi-starvation, rags and premature death; and they vote for it and
uphold it.Let them drudge and let
them starve!'These words kept ringing in his ears as he walked through the crowded
streets early one fine evening a few days before Christmas.The shops
were all brilliantly lighted for the display of their Christmas stores,
and the pavements and even the carriageways were thronged with
sightseers.Barrington was specially interested in the groups of shabbily dressed
men and women and children who gathered in the roadway in front of the
poulterers' and butchers' shops, gazing at the meat and the serried
rows of turkeys and geese decorated with  ribbons and rosettes.He knew that to come here and look at these things was the only share
many of these poor people would have of them, and he marvelled greatly
at their wonderful patience and abject resignation.But what struck him most of all was the appearance of many of the
women, evidently working men's wives.Their faded, ill-fitting
garments and the tired, sad expressions on their pale and careworn
faces.Some of them were alone; others were accompanied by little
children who trotted along trustfully clinging to their mothers' hands.The sight of these poor little ones, their utter helplessness and
dependence, their patched unsightly clothing and broken boots, and the
wistful looks on their pitiful faces as they gazed into the windows of
the toy-shops, sent a pang of actual physical pain to his heart and
filled his eyes with tears.He knew that these children--naked of joy
and all that makes life dear--were being tortured by the sight of the
things that were placed so cruelly before their eyes, but which they
were not permitted to touch or to share; and, like Joseph of old, his
heart yearned over his younger brethren.He felt like a criminal because he was warmly clad and well fed in the
midst of all this want and unhappiness, and he flushed with shame
because he had momentarily faltered in his devotion to the noblest
cause that any man could be privileged to fight for--the uplifting of
the disconsolate and the oppressed.He presently came to a large toy shop outside which several children
were standing admiring the contents of the window.He recognized some
of these children and paused to watch them and to listen to their talk.They did not notice him standing behind them as they ranged to and fro
before the window, and as he looked at them, he was reminded of the way
in which captive animals walk up and down behind the bars of their
cages.These children wandered repeatedly, backwards and forwards from
one end of the window to the other, with their little hands pressed
against the impenetrable plate glass, choosing and pointing out to each
other the particular toys that took their fancies.cried Charley Linden, enthusiastically indicating a
large strongly built waggon.'If I had that I'd give Freddie rides in
it and bring home lots of firewood, and we could play at fire engines
as well.''I'd rather have this railway,' said Frankie Owen.'There's a real
tunnel and real coal in the tenders; then there's the station and the
signals and a place to turn the engine round, and a red lantern to
light when there's danger on the line.''Mine's this doll--not the biggest one, the one in pink with clothes
that you can take off,' said Elsie; 'and this tea set; and this
needlecase for Mother.'Little Freddie had let go his hold of Elsie, to whom he usually clung
tightly and was clapping his hands and chuckling with delight and
desire.'But it's no use lookin' at them any longer,' continued Elsie, with a
sigh, as she took hold of Freddie's hand to lead him away.'It's no
use lookin' at 'em any longer; the likes of us can't expect to have
such good things as them.'This remark served to recall Frankie and Charley to the stern realities
of life, and turning reluctantly away from the window they prepared to
follow Elsie, but Freddie had not yet learnt the lesson--he had not
lived long enough to understand that the good things of the world were
not for the likes of him; so when Elsie attempted to draw him away he
pursed up his underlip and began to cry, repeating that he wanted a
gee-gee.The other children clustered round trying to coax and comfort
him by telling him that no one was allowed to have anything out of the
windows yet--until Christmas--and that Santa Claus would be sure to
bring him a gee-gee then; but these arguments failed to make any
impression on Freddie, who tearfully insisted upon being supplied at
once.Whilst they were thus occupied they caught sight of Barrington, whom
they hailed with evident pleasure born of the recollection of certain
gifts of pennies and cakes they had at different times received from
him.'Hello, Mr Barrington,' said the two boys in a breath.'Hello,' replied Barrington, as he patted the baby's cheek.'He wants that there 'orse, mister, the one with the real 'air on,'
said Charley, smiling indulgently like a grown-up person who realized
the absurdity of the demand.'Fweddie want gee-gee,' repeated the child, taking hold of Barrington's
hand and returning to the window.'Tell him that Santa Claus'll bring it to him on Christmas,' whispered
Elsie.'P'raps he'll believe you and that'll satisfy him, and he's
sure to forget all about it in a little while.''Are you still out of work, Mr Barrington?''I've got something to do at last.''Well, that's a good job, ain't it?''And whom do you think I'm working for?'echoed the children, opening their eyes to the fullest
extent.'Yes,' continued Barrington, solemnly.'You know, he is a very old man
now, so old that he can't do all his work himself.Last year he was so
tired that he wasn't able to get round to all the children he wanted to
give things to, and consequently a great many of them never got
anything at all.So this year he's given me a job to help him.He's
given me some money and a list of children's names, and against their
names are written the toys they are to have.My work is to buy the
things and give them to the boys and girls whose names are on the list.'The children listened to this narrative with bated breath.Incredible
as the story seemed, Barrington's manner was so earnest as to almost
compel belief.'Really and truly, or are you only having a game?'said Frankie at
length, speaking almost in a whisper.Elsie and Charley maintained an
awestruck silence, while Freddie beat upon the glass with the palms of
his hands.'Really and truly,' replied Barrington unblushingly as he took out his
pocket-book and turned over the leaves.'I've got the list here;
perhaps your names are down for something.'The three children turned pale and their hearts beat violently as they
listened wide-eyed for what was to follow.'Let me see,' continued Barrington, scanning the pages of the book,
'Why, yes, here they are!Elsie Linden, one doll with clothes that can
be taken off, one tea-set, one needlecase.Freddie Easton, one horse
with real hair.Charley Linden, one four-wheeled waggon full of
groceries.Frankie Owen, one railway with tunnel, station, train with
real coal for engine, signals, red lamp and place to turn the engines
round.'Barrington closed the book: 'So you may as well have your things now,'
he continued, speaking in a matter-of-fact tone.'We'll buy them here;
it will save me a lot of work.I shall not have the trouble of taking
them round to where you live.It's lucky I happened to meet you, isn't
it?'The children were breathless with emotion, but they just managed to
gasp out that it was--very lucky.As they followed him into the shop, Freddie was the only one of the
four whose condition was anything like normal.All the others were in
a half-dazed state.Frankie was afraid that he was not really awake at
all.It couldn't be true; it must be a dream.In addition to the hair, the horse was furnished with four wheels.They
did not have it made into a parcel, but tied some string to it and
handed it over to its new owner.The elder children were scarcely
conscious of what took place inside the shop; they knew that Barrington
was talking to the shopman, but they did not hear what was said--the
sound seemed far away and unreal.The shopman made the doll, the tea-set and the needlecase into one
parcel and gave it to Elsie.The railway, in a stout cardboard box,
was also wrapped up in brown paper, and Frankie's heart nearly burst
when the man put the package into his arms.When they came out of the toy shop they said 'Good night' to Frankie,
who went off carrying his parcel very carefully and feeling as if he
were walking on air.The others went into a provision merchant's near
by, where the groceries were purchased and packed into the waggon.Then Barrington, upon referring to the list to make quite certain that
he had not forgotten anything, found that Santa Claus had put down a
pair of boots each for Elsie and Charley, and when they went to buy
these, it was seen that their stockings were all ragged and full of
holes, so they went to a draper's and bought some stocking also.Barrington said that although they were not on the list, he was sure
Santa Claus would not object--he had probably meant them to have them,
but had forgotten to put them down.Chapter 54

The End


The following evening Barrington called at Owen's place.He said he
was going home for the holidays and had come to say goodbye for a time.Owen had not been doing very well during these last few months,
although he was one of the few lucky ones who had had some small share
of work.Most of the money he earned went for rent, to pay which they
often had to go short of food.Lately his chest had become so bad that
the slightest exertion brought on fits of coughing and breathlessness,
which made it almost impossible to work even when he had the
opportunity; often it was only by an almost superhuman effort of will
that he was able to continue working at all.He contrived to keep up
appearances to a certain extent before Rushton, who, although he knew
that Owen was not so strong as the other men, was inclined to overlook
it so long as he was able to do his share of work, for Owen was a very
useful hand when things were busy.But lately some of the men with
whom he worked began to manifest dissatisfaction at having him for a
mate.When two men are working together, the master expects to see two
men's work done, and if one of the two is not able to do his share it
makes it all the harder for the other.He never had the money to go to a doctor to get advice, but earlier in
the winter he had obtained from Rushton a ticket for the local
hospital.Every Saturday throughout the year when the men were paid
they were expected to put a penny or twopence in the hospital box.Contributions were obtained in this way from every firm and workshop in
the town.The masters periodically handed these boxes over to the
hospital authorities and received in return some tickets which they
gave to anyone who needed and asked for them.The employer had to fill
in the ticket or application form with the name and address of the
applicant, and to certify that in his opinion the individual was a
deserving case,'suitable to receive this charity'.In common with the
majority of workmen, Owen had a sort of horror of going for advice to
this hospital, but he was so ill that he stifled his pride and went.It happened that it turned out to be more expensive than going to a
private doctor, for he had to be at the hospital at a certain hour on a
particular morning.To do this he had to stay away from work.The
medicine they prescribed and which he had to buy did him no good, for
the truth was that it was not medicine that he--like thousands of
others--needed, but proper conditions of life and proper food; things
that had been for years past as much out of his reach as if he had been
dying alone in the middle of a desert.Occasionally Nora contrived--by going without some other necessary--to
buy him a bottle of one of the many much-advertised medicines; but
although some of these things were good she was not able to buy enough
for him to derive any benefit from them.Although he was often seized with a kind of terror of the future--of
being unable to work--he fought against these feelings and tried to
believe that when the weather became warmer he would be all right once
more.When Barrington came in Owen was sitting in a deck-chair by the fire in
the sitting-room.He had been to work that day with Harlow, washing off
the ceilings and stripping the old paper from the walls of two rooms in
Rushton's home, and he looked very haggard and exhausted.'I have never told you before,' said Barrington, after they had been
talking for a while, 'but I suppose you have guessed that I did not
work for Rushton because I needed to do so in order to live.I just
wanted to see things for myself; to see life as it is lived by the
majority.He doesn't approve of my
opinions, but at same time he does not interfere with me for holding
them, and I have a fairly liberal allowance which I spent in my own
way.I'm going to pass Christmas with my own people, but in the spring
I intend to fit out a Socialist Van, and then I shall come back here.We'll have some of the best speakers in the movement; we'll hold
meetings every night; we'll drench the town with literature, and we'll
start a branch of the party.'Owen's eye kindled and his pale face flushed.'I shall be able to do something to advertise the meetings,' he said.For instance, I could paint some posters and placards.''And I can help to give away handbills,' chimed in Frankie, looking up
from the floor, where he was seated working the railway.'I know a lot
of boys who'll come along with me to put 'em under the doors as well.'They were in the sitting-room and the door was shut.Mrs Owen was in
the next room with Ruth.While the two men were talking the front-door
bell was heard to ring and Frankie ran out to see who it was, closing
the door after him.Barrington and Owen continued their conversation,
and from time to time they could hear a low murmur of voices from the
adjoining room.After a little while they heard some one go out by the
front door, and almost immediately afterward Frankie--wild with
excitement, burst into the room, crying out:

'Dad and Mr Barrington!And he began capering
gleefully about the room, evidently transported with joy.inquired Barrington, rather mystified
by this extraordinary conduct.'Mr Easton came with Freddie to see Mrs Easton, and she's gone home
again with them,' replied Freddie, 'and--she's given the baby to us for
a Christmas box!'Barrington was already familiar with the fact of Easton's separation
from his wife, and Owen now told him the Story of their reconciliation.His train left at eight;
it was already nearly half past seven, and he said he had a letter to
write.Nora brought the baby in to show him before he went, and then
she helped Frankie to put on his overcoat, for Barrington had requested
that the boy might be permitted to go a little way with him.There was a stationer's shop at the end of the street.He went in here
and bought a sheet of notepaper and an envelope, and, having borrowed
the pen and ink, wrote a letter which he enclosed in the envelope with
the two other pieces that he took out of his pocketbook.Having
addressed the letter he came out of the shop; Frankie was waiting for
him outside.'I want you to take this straight home and give it to your dad.I
don't want you to stop to play or even to speak to anyone till you get
home.''I won't stop running all the way.''I think I have time to
go back with you as far as your front door,' he said, 'then I shall be
quite sure you haven't lost it.'They accordingly retraced their steps and in a few minutes reached the
entrance to the house.Barrington opened the door and stood for a
moment in the hall watching Frankie ascend the stairs.inquired the boy, pausing and
looking over the banisters.'Because we can see the bridge from our front-room window, and if you
were to wave your handkerchief as your train goes over the bridge, we
could wave back.'Barrington waited till he heard Frankie open and close the door of
Owen's flat, and then he hurried away.When he gained the main road he
heard the sound of singing and saw a crowd at the corner of one of the
side-streets.As he drew near he perceived that it was a religious
meeting.There was a lighted lamp on a standard in the centre of the crowd and
on the glass of this lamp was painted: 'Be not deceived: God is not
mocked.'Mr Rushton was preaching in the centre of the ring.He said that they
had come hout there that evening to tell the Glad Tidings of Great Joy
to hall those dear people that he saw standing around.The members of
the Shining Light Chapel--to which he himself belonged--was the
organizers of that meeting but it was not a sectarian meeting, for he
was 'appy to say that several members of other denominations was there
co-operating with them in the good work.As he continued his address,
Rushton repeatedly referred to the individuals who composed the crowd
as his 'Brothers and Sisters' and, strange to say, nobody laughed.Barrington looked round upon the 'Brothers': Mr Sweater, resplendent in
a new silk hat of the latest fashion, and a fur-trimmed overcoat.Mr Bosher, Vicar of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, Mr
Grinder--one of the churchwardens at the same place of alleged
worship--both dressed in broadcloth and fine linen and glossy silk
hats, while their general appearance testified to the fact that they
had fared sumptuously for many days.Mr Didlum, Mrs Starvem, Mr
Dauber, Mr Botchit, Mr Smeeriton, and Mr Leavit.John Starr, doing the work for which he
was paid.As he stood there in the forefront of this company, there was nothing
in his refined and comely exterior to indicate that his real function
was to pander to and flatter them; to invest with an air of
respectability and rectitude the abominably selfish lives of the gang
of swindlers, slave-drivers and petty tyrants who formed the majority
of the congregation of the Shining Light Chapel.He was doing the work for which he was paid.By the mere fact of his
presence there, condoning and justifying the crimes of these typical
representatives of that despicable class whose greed and inhumanity
have made the earth into a hell.There was also a number of'respectable', well-dressed people who
looked as if they could do with a good meal, and a couple of shabbily
dressed, poverty-stricken-looking individuals who seemed rather out of
place in the glittering throng.The remainder of the Brothers consisted of half-starved, pale-faced
working men and women, most of them dressed in other people's cast-off
clothing, and with broken, patched-up, leaky boots on their feet.Rushton having concluded his address, Didlum stepped forward to give
out the words of the hymn the former had quoted at the conclusion of
his remarks:


        'Oh, come and jine this 'oly band,
        And hon to glory go.'Strange and incredible as it may appear to the reader, although none of
them ever did any of the things Jesus said, the people who were
conducting this meeting had the effrontery to claim to be followers of
Christ--Christians!Jesus said: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth', 'Love not
the world nor the things of the world', 'Woe unto you that are rich--it
is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to enter the kingdom of heaven.'Yet all these self-styled
'Followers' of Christ made the accumulation of money the principal
business of their lives.Jesus said: 'Be ye not called masters; for they bind heavy burdens and
grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they
themselves will not touch them with one of their fingers.For one is
your master, even Christ, and ye are all brethren.'But nearly all
these alleged followers of the humble Workman of Nazareth claimed to be
other people's masters or mistresses.And as for being all brethren,
whilst most of these were arrayed in broadcloth and fine linen and
fared sumptuously every day, they knew that all around them thousands
of those they hypocritically called their 'brethren', men, women and
little children, were slowly perishing of hunger and cold; and we have
already seen how much brotherhood existed between Sweater and Rushton
and the miserable, half-starved wretches in their employment.Whenever they were asked why they did not practise the things Jesus
preached, they replied that it is impossible to do so!They did not
seem to realize that when they said this they were saying, in effect,
that Jesus taught an impracticable religion; and they appeared to
forget that Jesus said, 'Wherefore call ye me Lord, Lord, when ye do
not the things I say?...''Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and
doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house
upon the sand.'But although none of these self-styled 'Followers' of Christ, ever did
the things that Jesus said, they talked a great deal about them, and
sang hymns, and for a pretence made long prayers, and came out here to
exhort those who were still in darkness to forsake their evil ways.And
they procured this lantern and wrote a text upon it: 'Be not deceived,
God is not mocked.'They stigmatized as 'infidels' all those who differed from them,
forgetting that the only real infidels are those who are systematically
false and unfaithful to the Master they pretend to love and serve.Grinder, having a slight cold, had not spoken this evening, but several
other infidels, including Sweater, Didlum, Bosher, and Starr, had
addressed the meeting, making a special appeal to the working people,
of whom the majority of the crowd was composed, to give up all the vain
pleasures of the world in which they at present indulged, and, as
Rushton had eloquently put it at the close of his remarks:

        'Come and jine this 'Oly band and hon to glory go!'As Didlum finished reading out the words, the lady at the harmonium
struck up the tune of the hymns, and the disciples all joined in the
singing:

        'Oh, come and join this 'oly band and hon to glory go.'During the singing certain of the disciples went about amongst the
crowd distributing tracts.Presently one of them offered one to
Barrington and as the latter looked at the man he saw that it was
Slyme, who also recognized him at the same instant and greeted him by
name.Barrington made no reply except to decline the tract:

'I don't want that--from you,' he said contemptuously.'Oh, I know what you're thinking of,' he said after
a pause and speaking in an injured tone; 'but you shouldn't judge
anyone too hard.It wasn't only my fault, and you don't know 'ow much
I've suffered for it.If it 'adn't been for the Lord, I believe I
should 'ave drownded myself.'Barrington made no answer and Slyme slunk off, and when the hymn was
finished Brother Sweater stood forth and gave all those present a
hearty invitation to attend the services to be held during the ensuing
week at the Chapel of the Shining Light.He invited them there
specially, of course, because it was the place with which he was
himself connected, but he entreated and begged of them even if they
would not come there to go Somewhere; there were plenty of other places
of worship in the town; in fact, there was one at the corner of nearly
every street.Those who did not fancy the services at the Shining
Light could go to the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, but he really did
hope that all those dear people whom he saw standing round would go
Somewhere.A short prayer from Bosher closed the meeting, and now the reason for
the presence of the two poverty-stricken-looking shabbily dressed
disciples was made manifest, for while the better dressed and therefore
more respectable Brothers were shaking hands with and grinning at each
other or hovering round the two clergymen and Mr Sweater, these two
poor wretches carried away the harmonium and the lantern, together with
the hymn books and what remained of the tracts.As Barrington hurried
off to catch the train one of the 'Followers' gave him a card which he
read by the light of a street lamp--

                   Come and join the Brotherhood
                    at the Shining Light Chapel
                                PSA
                    Every Sunday at 3 o'clock.'Oh come and join this Holy Band
                        and on to Glory go.'Barrington thought he would, rather go to hell--if there were such a
place--with some decent people, than share 'glory' with a crew like
this.Nora sat sewing by the fireside in the front room, with the baby asleep
in her lap.Owen was reclining in the deck-chair opposite.They had
both been rather silent and thoughtful since Barrington's departure.It was mainly by their efforts that the reconciliation between Easton
and Ruth had been effected and they had been so desirous of
accomplishing that result that they had not given much thought to their
own position.'I feel that I could not bear to part with her for anything now,' said
Nora at last breaking the long silence, 'and Frankie is so fond of her
too.But all the same I can't feel happy about it when I think how ill
you are.''Oh, I shall be all right when the weather gets a little warmer,' said
Owen, affecting a cheerfulness he did not feel.'We have always pulled
through somehow or other; the poor little thing is not going to make
much difference, and she'll be as well off with us as she would have
been if Ruth had not gone back.'As he spoke he leaned over and touched the hand of the sleeping child
and the little fingers closed round one of his with a clutch that sent
a thrill all through him.As he looked at this little helpless,
dependent creature, he realized with a kind of thankfulness that he
would never have the heart to carry out the dreadful project he had
sometimes entertained in hours of despondency.'We've always got through somehow or other,' he repeated, 'and we'll do
so still.'Presently they heard Frankie's footsteps ascending the stairs and a
moment afterwards the boy entered the room.'We have to look out of the window and wave to Mr Barrington when his
train goes over the bridge,' he cried breathlessly.Open the window, quick, Dad, or it may be too late.''There's plenty of time yet,' replied Owen, smiling at the boy's
impetuosity.We don't want the window open
all that time.It's only a quarter to eight by our clock now, and
that's five minutes fast.'However, so as to make quite certain that the train should not run past
unnoticed, Frankie pulled up the blind and, rubbing the steam off the
glass, took up his station at the window to watch for its coming, while
Owen opened the letter:

'Dear Owen,

'Enclosed you will find two bank-notes, one for ten pounds and the
other for five.The first I beg you will accept from me for yourself
in the same spirit that I offer it, and as I would accept it from you
if our positions were reversed.If I were in need, I know that you
would willingly share with me whatever you had and I could not hurt you
by refusing.The other note I want you to change tomorrow morning.Give three pounds of it to Mrs Linden and the remainder to Bert White's
mother.'Wishing you all a happy Xmas and hoping to find you well and eager for
the fray when I come back in the spring,

                             'Yours for the cause,

                                                  'George Barrington.'Owen read it over two or three times before he could properly
understand it and then, without a word of comment--for he could not
have spoken at that moment to save his life--he passed it to Nora, who
felt, as she read it in her turn, as if a great burden had been lifted
from her heart.All the undefined terror of the future faded away as
she thought of all this small piece of paper made possible.Meanwhile, Frankie, at the window, was straining his eyes in the
direction of the station.'Don't you think we'd better have the window open now, Dad?'he said at
last as the clock struck eight.'The steam keeps coming on the glass
as fast as I wipe it off and I can't see out properly.I'm sure it's
nearly time now; p'raps our clock isn't as fast as you think it is.''All right, we'll have it open now, so as to be on the safe side,' said
Owen as he stood up and raised the sash, and Nora, having wrapped the
child up in a shawl, joined them at the window.'It can't be much longer now, you know,' said Frankie.They turned the red light off the signal just before you opened
the window.'In a very few minutes they heard the whistle of the locomotive as it
drew out of the station, then, an instant before the engine itself came
into sight round the bend, the brightly polished rails were
illuminated, shining like burnished gold in the glare of its headlight;
a few seconds afterwards the train emerged into view, gathering speed
as it came along the short stretch of straight way, and a moment later
it thundered across the bridge.It was too far away to recognize his
face, but they saw someone looking out of a carriage window waving a
handkerchief, and they knew it was Barrington as they waved theirs in
return.Soon there remained nothing visible of the train except the
lights at the rear of the guard's van, and presently even those
vanished into the surrounding darkness.The lofty window at which they were standing overlooked several of the
adjacent streets and a great part of the town.On the other side of the
road were several empty houses, bristling with different house agents'
advertisement boards and bills.About twenty yards away, the shop
formerly tenanted by Mr Smallman, the grocer, who had become bankrupt
two or three months previously, was also plastered with similar
decorations.A little further on, at the opposite corner, were the
premises of the Monopole Provision Stores, where brilliant lights were
just being extinguished, for they, like most of the other shops, were
closing their premises for the night, and the streets took on a more
cheerless air as one after another their lights disappeared.It had been a fine day, and during the earlier part of the evening the
moon, nearly at the full, had been shining in a clear and starry sky;
but a strong north-east wind had sprung up within the last hour; the
weather had become bitterly cold and the stars were rapidly being
concealed from view by the dense banks of clouds that were slowly
accumulating overhead.As they remained at the window looking out over this scene for a few
minutes after the train had passed out of sight, it seemed to Owen that
the gathering darkness was as a curtain that concealed from view the
Infamy existing beyond.In every country, myriads of armed men waiting
for their masters to give them the signal to fall upon and rend each
other like wild beasts.All around was a state of dreadful anarchy;
abundant riches, luxury, vice, hypocrisy, poverty, starvation, and
crime.Men literally fighting with each other for the privilege of
working for their bread, and little children crying with hunger and
cold and slowly perishing of want.The gloomy shadows enshrouding the streets, concealing for the time
their grey and mournful air of poverty and hidden suffering, and the
black masses of cloud gathering so menacingly in the tempestuous sky,
seemed typical of the Nemesis which was overtaking the Capitalist
System.That atrocious system which, having attained to the fullest
measure of detestable injustice and cruelty, was now fast crumbling
into ruin, inevitably doomed to be overwhelmed because it was all so
wicked and abominable, inevitably doomed to sink under the blight and
curse of senseless and unprofitable selfishness out of existence for
ever, its memory universally execrated and abhorred.But from these ruins was surely growing the glorious fabric of the
Co-operative Commonwealth.Mankind, awaking from the long night of
bondage and mourning and arising from the dust wherein they had lain
prone so long, were at last looking upward to the light that was riving
asunder and dissolving the dark clouds which had so long concealed from
them the face of heaven.The light that will shine upon the world wide
Fatherland and illumine the gilded domes and glittering pinnacles of
the beautiful cities of the future, where men shall dwell together in
true brotherhood and goodwill and joy.The Golden Light that will be
diffused throughout all the happy world from the rays of the risen sun
of Socialism.Appendix

Mugsborough


Mugsborough was a town of about eighty thousand inhabitants, about two
hundred miles from London.It was built in a verdant valley.Looking
west, north or east from the vicinity of the fountain on the Grand
Parade in the centre of the town, one saw a succession of pine-clad
hills.To the south, as far as the eye could see, stretched a vast,
cultivated plain that extended to the south coast, one hundred miles
away.The climate was supposed to be cool in summer and mild in winter.The town proper nestled in the valley: to the west, the most beautiful
and sheltered part was the suburb of Irene: here were the homes of the
wealthy residents and prosperous tradespeople, and numerous
boarding-houses for the accommodation of well-to-do visitors.East,
the town extended up the <DW72> to the top of the hill and down the
other side to the suburb of Windley, where the majority of the working
classes lived.Years ago, when the facilities for foreign travel were fewer and more
costly, Mugsborough was a favourite resort of the upper classes, but of
late years most of these patriots have adopted the practice of going on
the Continent to spend the money they obtain from the working people of
England.However, Mugsborough still retained some semblance of
prosperity.Summer or winter the place was usually fairly full of what
were called good-class visitors, either holidaymakers or invalids.The
Grand Parade was generally crowded with well-dressed people and
carriages.The shops appeared to be well-patronized and at the time of
our story an air of prosperity pervaded the town.But this fair
outward appearance was deceitful.The town was really a vast whited
sepulchre; for notwithstanding the natural advantages of the place the
majority of the inhabitants existed in a state of perpetual poverty
which in many cases bordered on destitution.One of the reasons for
this was that a great part of the incomes of the tradespeople and
boarding-house-keepers and about a third of the wages of the working
classes were paid away as rent and rates.For years the Corporation had been borrowing money for necessary public
works and improvements, and as the indebtedness of the town increased
the rates rose in proportion, because the only works and services
undertaken by the Council were such as did not yield revenue.Every
public service capable of returning direct profit was in the hands of
private companies, and the shares of the private companies were in the
hands of the members of the Corporation, and the members of the
Corporation were in the hands of the four most able and intellectual of
their number, Councillors Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, each of
whom was a director of one or more of the numerous companies which
battened on the town.The Tramway Company, the Water Works Company, the Public Baths Company,
the Winter Gardens Company, the Grand Hotel Company and numerous
others.There was, however, one Company in which Sweater, Rushton,
Didlum and Grinder had no shares, and that was the Gas Company, the
oldest and most flourishing of them all.This institution had grown
with the place; most of the original promoters were dead, and the
greater number of the present shareholders were non-residents; although
they lived on the town, they did not live in it.The profits made by this Company were so great that, being prevented by
law from paying a larger dividend than ten percent, they frequently
found it a difficult matter to decide what to do with the money.They
paid the Directors and principal officials--themselves shareholders, of
course--enormous salaries.They built and furnished costly and
luxurious offices and gave the rest to the shareholders in the form of
Bonuses.There was one way in which the Company might have used some of the
profits: it might have granted shorter hours and higher wages to the
workmen whose health was destroyed and whose lives were shortened by
the terrible labour of the retort-houses and the limesheds; but of
course none of the directors or shareholders ever thought of doing
that.It was not the business of the Company to concern itself about
them.Years ago, when it might have been done for a comparatively small
amount, some hare-brained Socialists suggested that the town should buy
the Gas Works, but the project was wrecked by the inhabitants, upon
whom the mere mention of the word Socialist had the same effect that
the sight of a red rag is popularly supposed to have on a bull.Of course, even now it was still possible to buy out the Company, but
it was supposed that it would cost so much that it was generally
considered to be impracticable.Although they declined to buy the Gas works, the people of Mugsborough
had to buy the gas.The amount paid by the municipality to the Company
for the public lighting of the town loomed large in the accounts of the
Council.From thence to my
Lady at the Wardrobe and thence to the Theatre, and saw the "Antipodes,"
wherein there is much mirth, but no great matter else.Bostock whom I met there (a clerk formerly of Mr.Phelps) to the Devil
tavern, and there drank and so away.I to my uncle Fenner's, where my
father was with him at an alehouse, and so we three went by ourselves and
sat talking a great while about a broker's daughter that he do propose for
a wife for Tom, with a great portion, but I fear it will not take, but he
will do what he can.So we broke up, and going through the street we met
with a mother and son, friends of my father's man, Ned's, who are angry at
my father's putting him away, which troubled me and my father, but all
will be well as to that.We have news this morning of my uncle Thomas and
his son Thomas being gone into the country without giving notice thereof
to anybody, which puts us to a stand, but I fear them not.At night at
home I found a letter from my Lord Sandwich, who is now very well again of
his feaver, but not yet gone from Alicante, where he lay sick, and was
twice let blood.This letter dated the 22nd July last, which puts me out
of doubt of his being ill.In my coming home I called in at the Crane
tavern at the Stocks by appointment, and there met and took leave of Mr.Fanshaw, who goes to-morrow and Captain Isham toward their voyage to
Portugal.Here we drank a great deal of wine, I too much and Mr.Fanshaw
till he could hardly go.This morning to the Wardrobe, and there took leave of my Lord
Hinchingbroke and his brother, and saw them go out by coach toward Rye in
their way to France, whom God bless.Then I was called up to my Lady's
bedside, where we talked an hour about Mr.Edward Montagu's disposing of
the L5000 for my Lord's departure for Portugal, and our fears that he will
not do it to my Lord's honour, and less to his profit, which I am to
enquire a little after.Hence to the office, and there sat till noon, and
then my wife and I by coach to my cozen, Thos.Pepys, the Executor, to
dinner, where some ladies and my father and mother, where very merry, but
methinks he makes but poor dinners for such guests, though there was a
poor venison pasty.Hence my wife and I to the Theatre, and there saw
"The Joviall Crew," where the King, Duke and Duchess, and Madame Palmer,
were; and my wife, to her great content, had a full sight of them all the
while.Hence to my father's, and there staid to
talk a while and so by foot home by moonshine.In my way and at home, my
wife making a sad story to me of her brother Balty's a condition, and
would have me to do something for him, which I shall endeavour to do, but
am afeard to meddle therein for fear I shall not be able to wipe my hands
of him again, when I once concern myself for him.I went to bed, my wife
all the while telling me his case with tears, which troubled me.At home all the morning setting papers in order.At noon to the
Exchange, and there met with Dr.Williams by appointment, and with him
went up and down to look for an attorney, a friend of his, to advise with
about our bond of my aunt Pepys of L200, and he tells me absolutely that
we shall not be forced to pay interest for the money yet.I spent the whole afternoon drinking with him and so home.This day I counterfeited a letter to Sir W. Pen, as from the thief that
stole his tankard lately, only to abuse and laugh at him.At the office all the morning, and at noon my father, mother, and
my aunt Bell (the first time that ever she was at my house) come to dine
with me, and were very merry.After dinner the two women went to visit my
aunt Wight, &c., and my father about other business, and I abroad to my
bookseller, and there staid till four o'clock, at which time by
appointment I went to meet my father at my uncle Fenner's.So thither I
went and with him to an alehouse, and there came Mr.Evans, the taylor,
whose daughter we have had a mind to get for a wife for Tom, and then my
father, and there we sat a good while and talked about the business; in
fine he told us that he hath not to except against us or our motion, but
that the estate that God hath blessed him with is too great to give where
there is nothing in present possession but a trade and house; and so we
friendly ended.There parted, my father and I together, and walked a
little way, and then at Holborn he and I took leave of one another, he
being to go to Brampton (to settle things against my mother comes)
tomorrow morning.At noon my wife and I met at the Wardrobe, and there dined with the
children, and after dinner up to my Lady's bedside, and talked and laughed
a good while.Then my wife end I to Drury Lane to the French comedy,
which was so ill done, and the scenes and company and every thing else so
nasty and out of order and poor, that I was sick all the while in my mind
to be there.Here my wife met with a son of my Lord Somersett, whom she
knew in France, a pretty man; I showed him no great countenance, to avoyd
further acquaintance.That done, there being nothing pleasant but the
foolery of the farce, we went home.At home and the office all the morning, and at noon comes Luellin
to me, and he and I to the tavern and after that to Bartholomew fair, and
there upon his motion to a pitiful alehouse, where we had a dirty slut or
two come up that were whores, but my very heart went against them, so that
I took no pleasure but a great deal of trouble in being there and getting
from thence for fear of being seen.From hence he and I walked towards
Ludgate and parted.I back again to the fair all alone, and there met
with my Ladies Jemimah and Paulina, with Mr.Pickering and Madamoiselle,
at seeing the monkeys dance, which was much to see, when they could be
brought to do so, but it troubled me to sit among such nasty company.After that with them into Christ's Hospitall, and there Mr.Pickering
bought them some fairings, and I did give every one of them a bauble,
which was the little globes of glass with things hanging in them, which
pleased the ladies very well.After that home with them in their coach,
and there was called up to my Lady, and she would have me stay to talk
with her, which I did I think a full hour.And the poor lady did with so
much innocency tell me how Mrs.Crispe had told her that she did intend,
by means of a lady that lies at her house, to get the King to be godfather
to the young lady that she is in childbed now of; but to see in what a
manner my Lady told it me, protesting that she sweat in the very telling
of it, was the greatest pleasure to me in the world to see the simplicity
and harmlessness of a lady.Then down to supper with the ladies, and so
home, Mr.Moore (as he and I cannot easily part) leading me as far as
Fenchurch Street to the Mitre, where we drank a glass of wine and so
parted, and I home and to bed.My maid Jane newly gone, and Pall left now to do all
the work till another maid comes, which shall not be till she goes away
into the country with my mother.My Lord
Sandwich in the Straits and newly recovered of a great sickness at
Alicante.My father gone to settle at Brampton, and myself under much
business and trouble for to settle things in the estate to our content.But what is worst, I find myself lately too much given to seeing of plays,
and expense, and pleasure, which makes me forget my business, which I must
labour to amend.No money comes in, so that I have been forced to borrow
a great deal for my own expenses, and to furnish my father, to leave
things in order.I have some trouble about my brother Tom, who is now
left to keep my father's trade, in which I have great fears that he will
miscarry for want of brains and care.At Court things are in very ill
condition, there being so much emulacion, poverty, and the vices of
drinking, swearing, and loose amours, that I know not what will be the end
of it, but confusion.And the Clergy so high, that all people that I meet
with do protest against their practice.In short, I see no content or
satisfaction any where, in any one sort of people.The Benevolence

     [A voluntary contribution made by the subjects to their sovereign.Upon this occasion the clergy alone gave L33,743: See May 31st,

proves so little, and an occasion of so much discontent every where; that
it had better it had never been set up.We are
at our Office quiet, only for lack of money all things go to rack.Our
very bills offered to be sold upon the Exchange at 10 per cent.We
are upon getting Sir R. Ford's house added to our Office.But I see so
many difficulties will follow in pleasing of one another in the dividing
of it, and in becoming bound personally to pay the rent of L200 per annum,
that I do believe it will yet scarce come to pass.The season very sickly
every where of strange and fatal fevers.ETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:

Yes, successfully.They have just passed the most difficult part
of the road--you know where the swamps are--

STEIN

Oh, yes.BLUMENFELD

The road could not support the heavy weight and caved in.He ordered a report about the
movement at each and every kilometer.STEIN

Now he will sleep in peace.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein!When he is not listening to
reports or issuing commands, he is thinking.As the personal
correspondent of his Highness I have the honor to know many
things which others are not allowed to know--Oh, gentlemen, he
has a wonderful mind!_Another very young officer enters, stands at attention before
Blumenfeld._

BLUMENFELD

Sit down, von Schauss.BLUMENFELD

He has a German philosophical mind which manages guns as
Leibnitz managed ideas.Everything is preconceived, everything
is prearranged, the movement of our millions of people has been
elaborated into such a remarkable system that Kant himself
would have been proud of it.Gentlemen, we are led forward by
indomitable logic and by an iron will._The officers express their approval by subdued exclamations of
"bravo."_

BLUMENFELD

How can he sleep, if the movement of our armies is but the
movement of parts of his brains!And what is the use of sleep
in general?I sleep very little myself, and I advise you,
gentlemen, not to indulge in foolish sleep.RITZAU

But our human organism requires sleep.BLUMENFELD

Nonsense!Organism--that is something invented by the doctors
who are looking for practice among the fools.I know only my desires and my will, which says:
"Gerhardt, do this!SCHAUSS

Will you permit me to take down your words in my notebook?BLUMENFELD

Please, Schauss._The telegraphist has entered._

ZIGLER

I really don't know, but something strange has happened.It
seems that we are being interfered with, I can't understand
anything.BLUMENFELD

What is it?ZIGLER

We can make out one word, "Water"--but after that all is
incomprehensible.And then again, "Water"--

BLUMENFELD

What water?ZIGLER

He is also surprised and cannot understand.BLUMENFELD

You are a donkey, Zigler!We'll have to call out--

_The Commander comes out.His voice is dry and unimpassioned._

COMMANDER

Blumenfeld!_All jump up, straighten themselves, as if petrified._

What is this?BLUMENFELD

I have not yet investigated it, your Highness.Zigler is
reporting--

COMMANDER

What is it, Zigler?ZIGLER

Your Highness, we are being interfered with.I don't know what
it is, but I can't understand anything.We have been able to
make out only one word--"Water."COMMANDER

_Turning around._

See what it is, Blumenfeld, and report to me--

_Engineer runs in._

ENGINEER

Where is Blumenfeld?COMMANDER

_Pausing._

What has happened there, Kloetz?ENGINEER

They don't respond to our calls, your Highness.COMMANDER

You think something serious has happened?ENGINEER

I dare not think so, your Highness, but I am alarmed.Silence is
the only answer to our most energetic calls._The second telegraphist has entered quietly._

GREITZER

They are silent, your Highness._Brief pause._

COMMANDER

_Again turning to the door._

Please investigate this, Lieutenant._He advances a step to the door, then stops.There is a
commotion behind the windows--a noise and the sound of voices.The noise keeps
growing, turning at times into a loud roar._

What is that?An officer, bareheaded, rushes in
excitedly, his hair disheveled, his face pale._

OFFICER

I want to see his Highness.BLUMENFELD

_Hissing._

You are insane!COMMANDER

Calm yourself, officer.I have the honor to report to you that the
Belgians have burst the dams, and our armies are flooded._With horror._

We must hurry, your Highness!OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.COMMANDER

Compose yourself, you are not behaving properly!I am asking you
about our field guns--

OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.We must hurry, your Highness, we are in a valley.They have broken the dams; and the water is
rushing this way violently.It is only five kilometers away from
here--and we can hardly--.The beginning of a terrible panic is felt,
embracing the entire camp.All watch impatiently the reddening
face of the Commander._

COMMANDER

But this is--

_He strikes the table with his fist forcibly._

Absurd!_He looks at them with cold fury, but all lower their eyes.The
frightened officer is trembling and gazing at the window.The
lights grow brighter outside--it is evident that a building has
been set on fire.A
dull noise, then the crash of shots is heard.The discipline is
disappearing gradually._

BLUMENFELD

They have gone mad!STEIN

But that can't be the Belgians!RITZAU

They may have availed themselves--

BLUMENFELD

Aren't you ashamed, Stein?I beg of you--

_Suddenly a piercing, wild sound of a horn is heard ordering to
retreat.The roaring sound is growing rapidly._

COMMANDER

_Shots._

Who has commanded to retreat?_Blumenfeld lowers his head._

COMMANDER

This is not the German Army!You are unworthy of being called
soldiers!BLUMENFELD

_Stepping forward, with dignity._

Your Highness!We are not fishes to swim in the water!_Runs out, followed by two or three others.The panic is
growing._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life is in danger--your
Highness.Only the
sentinel remains in the position of one petrified._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life--I am afraid that
another minute, and it will be too late!COMMANDER

But this is--

_Again strikes the table with his fist._

But this is absurd, Blumenfeld!_Curtain_



SCENE VI


_The same hour of night.In the darkness it is difficult to
discern the silhouettes of the ruined buildings and of the
trees.At the right, a half-destroyed bridge.From time to time the German flashlights are
seen across the dark sky.Near the bridge, an automobile in
which the wounded Emil Grelieu and his son are being carried to
Antwerp.Jeanne and a young physician are with them.Something
has broken down in the automobile and a soldier-chauffeur is
bustling about with a lantern trying to repair it.Langloi
stands near him._


DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

Well?CHAUFFEUR

_Examining._

I don't know yet.DOCTOR

Is it a serious break?CHAUFFEUR

No--I don't know.MAURICE

_From the automobile._

What is it, Doctor?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

We'll start!DOCTOR

I don't know.MAURICE

Shall we stay here long?DOCTOR

_To the chauffeur._

Shall we stay here long?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

How do I know?_Hands the lantern to the doctor._

MAURICE

Then I will come out.JEANNE

You had better stay here, Maurice.MAURICE

No, mother, I am careful._Jumps off and watches the chauffeur at work._

MAURICE

How unfortunate that we are stuck here!CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

A bridge!DOCTOR

Yes, it is unfortunate.MAURICE

_Shrugging his shoulders._

Father did not want to leave.Mamina, do
you think our people are already in Antwerp?JEANNE

Yes, I think so.EMIL GRELIEU

No.It is very pleasant to breathe the fresh air.DOCTOR

_To Maurice._

I think we are still in the region which--

MAURICE

Yes.DOCTOR

_Looking at his watch._

Twenty--a quarter of ten.MAURICE

Then it is a quarter of an hour since the bursting of the dams.Mamma, do you hear, it is a quarter of ten now!JEANNE

Yes, I hear.MAURICE

But it is strange that we haven't heard any explosions.DOCTOR

How can you say that, Monsieur Maurice?MAURICE

I thought that such explosions would be heard a hundred
kilometers away.Our house and our
garden will soon be flooded!I wonder how high the water will
rise.Do you think it will reach up to the second story?CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

I am working.Mamma, see how the searchlights are working.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne, lift me a little.JEANNE

My dear, I don't know whether I am allowed to do it.DOCTOR

You may lift him a little, if it isn't very painful.JEANNE

Do you feel any pain?EMIL GRELIEU

No.MAURICE

Father, they are flashing the searchlights across the sky like
madmen._A bluish light is flashed over them, faintly illuminating the
whole group._

MAURICE

Right into my eyes!EMIL GRELIEU

I suppose so.Either they have been warned, or the water is
reaching them by this time.JEANNE

Do you think so, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.It seems to me that I hear the sound of the water from that
side._All listen and look in the direction from which the noise came._

DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

How unpleasant this is!MAURICE

Father, it seems to me I hear voices.Listen--it sounds as
though they are crying there.Father, the
Prussians are crying._A distant, dull roaring of a crowd is heard.The searchlights are
swaying from side to side._

EMIL GRELIEU

It is they.DOCTOR

If we don't start in a quarter of an hour--

EMIL GRELIEU

In half an hour, Doctor.MAURICE

Father, how beautiful and how terrible it is!JEANNE

What is it?MAURICE

I want to kiss it.JEANNE

What a foolish little boy you are, Maurice.MAURICE

Monsieur Langloi said that in three days from now I may remove
my bandage.Just think of it, in three days I shall be able to
take up my gun again!...The
chauffeur and the doctor draw their revolvers.A figure appears
from the field, approaching from one of the ditches.A peasant,
wounded in the leg, comes up slowly, leaning upon a cane._

MAURICE

Who is there?PEASANT

Our own, our own.MAURICE

Yes, we're going to the city.Our car has broken down, we're
repairing it.PEASANT

What am I doing here?They also look at him
attentively, by the light of the lantern._

CHAUFFEUR

Give me the light!PEASANT

Are you carrying a wounded man?I
cannot walk, it is very hard.I lay there in the ditch and when I heard you
speak French I crawled out.DOCTOR

How were you wounded?PEASANT

I was walking in the field and they shot me.They must have
thought I was a rabbit._Laughs hoarsely._

They must have thought I was a rabbit.What is the news,
gentlemen?MAURICE

Don't you know?PEASANT

What can I know?I lay there and looked at the sky--that's all I
know.Just look at it, I have been watching
it all the time.What is that I see in the sky, eh?EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down near us.MAURICE

Listen, sit down here.They are
crying there--the Prussians!They must have learned of
it by this time.Listen, it is so far, and yet we can hear!_The peasant laughs hoarsely._

MAURICE

Sit down, right here, the automobile is large.CHAUFFEUR

_Muttering._

Sit down, sit down!DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

What is it?MAURICE

What an unfortunate mishap!JEANNE

_Agitated._

They shot you like a rabbit?Do you hear, Emil--they thought a
rabbit was running!_She laughs loudly, the peasant also laughs._

PEASANT

I look like a rabbit!JEANNE

Do you hear, Emil?_Laughs._

EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

It makes me laugh--it seems so comical to me that they mistake
us for rabbits.And now, what are we now--water rats?Emil, just
picture to yourself, water rats in an automobile!JEANNE

No, no, I am not laughing any more, Maurice!_Laughs._

And what else are we?PEASANT

_Laughs._

And now we must hide in the ground--

JEANNE

_In the same tone._

And they will remain on the ground?EMIL GRELIEU

My dear!MAURICE

_To the doctor._

Listen, you must do something.Mamma, we are starting directly, my dear!JEANNE

No, never mind, I am not laughing any more.Maurice, I simply felt like talking.I
was forever silent, but just now I felt like chattering.Emil,
I am not disturbing you with my talk, am I?Why is the water so
quiet, Emil?It was the King who said, "The water is silent,"
was it not?But I should like to see it roar, crash like
thunder.... No, I cannot, I cannot bear this silence!Ah, why is
it so quiet--I cannot bear it!MAURICE

_To the chauffeur._

My dear fellow, please hurry up!CHAUFFEUR

Yes, yes!JEANNE

_Suddenly cries, threatening._

But I cannot bear it!_Covers her mouth with her hands; sobs._

I cannot!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne.JEANNE

_Sobbing, but calming herself somewhat._

I cannot bear it!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne!I am suffering, but I know this, Jeanne!CHAUFFEUR

In a moment, in a moment.EMIL GRELIEU

_Faintly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

Yes, yes, I know.... Forgive me, forgive me, I will soon--

_A loud, somewhat hoarse voice of a girl comes from the dark._

GIRL

Tell me how I can find my way to Lonua!_Exclamations of surprise._

MAURICE

Who is that?JEANNE

Emil, it is that girl!_Laughs._

She is also like a rabbit!DOCTOR

_Grumbles._

What is it, what is it--Who?Her dress is torn, her eyes look
wild.The peasant is laughing._

PEASANT

She is here again?CHAUFFEUR

Let me have the light!GIRL

_Loudly._

How can I find my way to Lonua?EMIL GRELIEU

Maurice, you must stop her!Doctor, you--

CHAUFFEUR

Put down the lantern!GIRL

_Shouts._

Hands off!No, no, you will not dare--

MAURICE

You can't catch her--

_The girl runs away._

EMIL GRELIEU

Doctor, you must catch her!She will perish here, quick--

_She runs away.The doctor follows her in the dark._

PEASANT

She asked me, too, how to go to Lonua._The girl's voice resounds in the dark and then there is
silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

You must catch her!MAURICE

But how, father?Jeanne
breaks into muffled laughter._

MAURICE

_Mutters._

Now he is gone!CHAUFFEUR

_Triumphantly._

Take your seats!MAURICE

But the doctor isn't here.CHAUFFEUR

Let us call him._Maurice and the chauffeur call: "Doctor!"_

CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

I must deliver Monsieur Grelieu, and I will deliver him.MAURICE

_Shouts._

Langloi!_A faint echo in the distance._

Come!_The response is nearer._

PEASANT

He did not catch her.She asked me, too,
about the road to Lonua._Laughs._

There are many like her now.EMIL GRELIEU

_Imploringly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

But I cannot, Emil.I used
to understand, I used to understand, but now--Where is Pierre?_Firmly._

Where is Pierre?MAURICE

Oh, will he be here soon?Mother dear, we'll start in a moment!JEANNE

Yes, yes, we'll start in a moment!Why such a dream, why such a dream?_A mice from the darkness, quite near._

JEANNE

_Frightened._

Who is shouting?What a strange dream, what a terrible,
terrible, terrible dream._Lowering her voice._

I cannot--why are you torturing me?EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne!EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne.But I swear to you by God, Jeanne!--Belgium
will live.Weep, sob, you are a mother.I too am crying with
you--But I swear by God: Belgium will live!God has given me the
light to see, and I can see.A new Spring will come here, the trees will be covered with
blossoms--I swear to you, Jeanne, they will be covered with
blossoms!And mothers will caress their children, and the sun
will shine upon their heads, upon their golden-haired little
heads!I see my nation: Here it is advancing with palm
leaves to meet God who has come to earth again.Weep, Jeanne,
you are a mother!Weep, unfortunate mother--God weeps with you.But there will be happy mothers here again--I see a new world,
Jeanne, I see a new life!But Djalma is marked with the sign.Mahal the Smuggler was the
first to know it."said the Indian, confounded by the Malay's
adroitness."Had he awoke," replied the other, calmly, "I should have been a dead
man--as I was charged to spare his life.""Because his life may be more useful to us than his death," said the
half-caste.Then, addressing the Malay, he added: "Brother, in risking
life for the good work, you have done to-day what we did yesterday, what
we may do again to-morrow.This time, you obey; another you will
command.""We all belong to Bowanee," answered the Malay."What is there yet to
do?--I am ready."Whilst he thus spoke, his face was turned towards the
door of the hut; on a sudden, he said in a low voice: "Here is Djalma."He must not see me yet," said Faringhea, retiring to an obscure corner
of the cabin, and hiding himself under a mat; "try to persuade him.If he
resists--I have my project."Hardly had Faringhea disappeared, saying these words, when Djalma arrived
at the door of the hovel.At sight of those three personages with their
forbidding aspect, Djalma started in surprise.But ignorant that these
men belonged to the Phansegars, and knowing that, in a country where
there are no inns, travellers often pass the night under a tent, or
beneath the shelter of some ruins, he continued to advance towards them.After the first moment, he perceived by the complexion and the dress of
one of these men, that he was an Indian, and he accosted him in the
Hindoo language: "I thought to have found here a European--a Frenchman--"

"The Frenchman is not yet come," replied the Indian; "but he will not be
long."Guessing by Djalma's question the means which Mahal had employed to draw
him into the snare, the Indian hoped to gain time by prolonging his
error.asked Djalma of the Phansegar."He appointed us to meet here, as he did you," answered the Indian.inquired Djalma, more and more astonished."General Simon told you to be at this place?""Yes, General Simon," replied the Indian.There was a moment's pause, during which Djalma sought in vain to explain
to himself this mysterious adventure.asked he, with a
look of suspicion; for the gloomy silence of the Phansegar's two
companions, who stared fixedly at each other, began to give him some
uneasiness."We are yours, if you will be ours," answered the Indian."I have no need of you--nor you of me."The English killed your father, a king; made you a
captive; proscribed you, you have lost all your possessions."At this cruel reminder, the countenance of Djalma darkened.He started,
and a bitter smile curled his lip.The Phansegar continued:

"Your father was just and brave--beloved by his subjects--they called him
'Father of the Generous,' and he was well named.Will you leave his death
unavenged?Will the hate, which gnaws at your heart, be without fruit?""My father died with arms in his hand.I revenged his death on the
English whom I killed in war.He, who has since been a father to me, and
who fought also in the same cause, told me, that it would now be madness
to attempt to recover my territory from the English.When they gave me my
liberty, I swore never again to set foot in India--and I keep the oaths I
make.""Those who despoiled you, who took you captive, who killed your
father--were men.Are there not other men, on whom you can avenge
yourself!"You, who speak thus of men, are not a man!""I, and those who resemble me, are more than men.We are, to the rest of
the human race, what the bold hunter is to the wild beasts, which they
run down in the forest.Will you be, like us, more than a man?Will you
glut surely, largely, safely--the hate which devours your heart, for all
the evil done you?""Your words become more and more obscure: I have no hatred in my heart,"
said Djalma."When an enemy is worthy of me, I fight with him; when he is
unworthy, I despise him.So that I have no hate--either for brave men or
cowards."cried the <DW64> on a sudden, pointing with rapid gesture to
the door, for Djalma and the Indian had now withdrawn a little from it,
and were standing in one corner of the hovel.At the shout of the <DW64>, Faringhea, who had not been perceived by
Djalma, threw off abruptly the mat which covered him, drew his crease,
started up like a tiger, and with one bound was out of the cabin.Then,
seeing a body of soldiers advancing cautiously in a circle, he dealt one
of them a mortal stroke, threw down two others, and disappeared in the
midst of the ruins.All this passed so instantaneously, that, when Djalma
turned round, to ascertain the cause of the <DW64>'s cry of alarm,
Faringhea had already disappeared.The muskets of several soldiers, crowding to the door, were immediately
pointed at Djalma and the three Stranglers, whilst others went in pursuit
of Faringhea.The <DW64>, the Malay, and the Indian, seeing the
impossibility of resistance, exchanged a few rapid words, and offered
their hands to the cords, with which some of the soldiers had provided
themselves.The Dutch captain, who commanded the squad, entered the cabin at this
moment.said he, pointing out Djalma to the
soldiers, who were occupied in binding the three Phansegars.Djalma had remained petrified with surprise, not understanding what was
passing round him; but, when he saw the sergeant and two soldiers
approach with ropes to bind him, he repulsed them with violent
indignation, and rushed towards the door where stood the officer.The
soldiers, who had supposed that Djalma would submit to his fate with the
same impassibility as his companions, were astounded by this resistance,
and recoiled some paces, being struck in spite of themselves, with the
noble and dignified air of the son of Kadja-sing."Why would you bind me like these men?"cried Djalma, addressing himself
in Hindostanee to the officer, who understood that language from his long
service in the Dutch colonies."Why would we bind you, wretch?--because you form part of this band of
assassins.added the officer in Dutch, speaking to the soldiers,
"are you afraid of him?--Tie the cord tight about his wrists; there will
soon be another about his neck.""You are mistaken," said Djalma, with a dignity and calmness which
astonished the officer; "I have hardly been in this place a quarter of an
hour--I do not know these men."Not a Phansegar like them?--Who will believe the falsehood?"cried Djalma, with so natural a movement and expression of
horror, that with a sign the officer stopped the soldiers, who were again
advancing to bind the son of Kadja-sing; "these men form part of that
horrible band of murderers!and you accuse me of being their
accomplice!--Oh, in this case, sir!I am perfectly at ease," said the
young man, with a smile of disdain."It will not be sufficient to say that you are tranquil," replied the
officer; "thanks to their confessions, we now know by what mysterious
signs to recognize the Thugs.""I repeat, sir, that I hold these murderers in the greatest horror, and
that I came here--"

The <DW64>, interrupting Djalma, said to the officer with a ferocious joy:
"You have hit it; the sons of the good work do know each other by marks
tattooed on their skin.For us, the hour has come--we give our necks to
the cord.Often enough have we twined it round the necks of those who
served not with us the good work.Now, look at our arms, and look at the
arms of this youth!"The officer, misinterpreting the words of the <DW64>, said to Djalma: "It
is quite clear, that if, as this <DW64> tells us, you do not bear on your
arm the mysterious symbol--(we are going to assure ourselves of the
fact), and if you can explain your presence here in a satisfactory
manner, you may be at liberty within two hours.""You do not understand me," said the <DW64> to the officer; "Prince Djalma
is one of us, for he bears on his left arm the name of Bowanee."he is like us, a son of Kale!""He is like us, a Phansegar," said the Indian.The three men, irritated at the horror which Djalma had manifested on
learning that they were Phansegars, took a savage pride in making it
believed that the son of Kadja-sing belonged to their frightful
association.The latter again
gave a look of disdainful pity, raised with his right hand his long, wide
left sleeve, and displayed his naked arm.cried the officer, for on the inner part of the fore
arm, a little below the bend, the name of the Bowanee, in bright red
Hindoo characters, was distinctly visible.The officer ran to the Malay,
and uncovered his arm; he saw the same word, the same signs.Not yet
satisfied, he assured himself that the <DW64> and the Indian were likewise
so marked.cried he, turning furiously towards Djalma; "you inspire even
more horror than your accomplices.Bind him like a cowardly assassin,"
added he to the soldiers; "like a cowardly assassin, who lies upon the
brink of the grave, for his execution will not be long delayed."Struck with stupor, Djalma, who for some moments had kept his eye riveted
on the fatal mark, was unable to pronounce a word, or make the least
movement: his powers of thought seemed to fail him, in presence of this
incomprehensible fact.said the officer to him, with
indignation."I cannot deny what I see--what is," said Djalma, quite overcome."It is lucky that you confess at last," replied the officer."Soldiers,
keep watch over him and his accomplices--you answer for them."Almost believing himself the sport of some wild dream.Djalma offered no
resistance, but allowed himself to be bound and removed with mechanical
passiveness.The officer, with part of his soldiers, hoped still to
discover Faringhea amongst the ruins; but his search was vain, and, after
spending an hour in fruitless endeavors, he set out for Batavia, where
the escort of the prisoners had arrived before him.Some hours after these events, M. Joshua van Dael thus finished his long
despatch, addressed to M. Rodin, of Paris:

"Circumstances were such, that I could not act otherwise; and, taking all
into consideration, it is a very small evil for a great good.Three
murderers are delivered over to justice, and the temporary arrest of
Djalma will only serve to make his innocence shine forth with redoubled
luster."Already this morning I went to the governor, to protest in favor of our
young prince.'As it was through me,' I said, 'that those three great
criminals fell into the hands of the authorities, let them at least show
me some gratitude, by doing everything to render clear as day the
innocence of Prince Djalma, so interesting by reason of his misfortunes
and noble qualities.Most certainly,' I added, 'when I came yesterday to
inform the governor, that the Phansegars would be found assembled in the
ruins of Tchandi, I was far from anticipating that any one would confound
with those wretches the adopted son of General Simon, an excellent man,
with whom I have had for some time the most honorable relations.We must,
then, at any cost, discover the inconceivable mystery that has placed
Djalma in this dangerous position;' and, I continued,'so convinced am I
of his innocence, that, for his own sake, I would not ask for any favor
on his behalf.He will have sufficient courage and dignity to wait
patiently in prison for the day of justice.'In all this, you see, I
spoke nothing but the truth, and had not to reproach myself with the
least deception, for nobody in the world is more convinced than I am of
Djalma's innocence."The governor answered me as I expected, that morally he felt as certain
as I did of the innocence of the young prince, and would treat him with
all possible consideration; but that it was necessary for justice to have
its course, because it would be the only way of demonstrating the
falsehood of the accusation, and discovering by what unaccountable
fatality that mysterious sign was tattooed upon Djalma's arm."Mahal the Smuggler, who alone could enlighten justice on this subject,
will in another hour have quitted Batavia, to go on board the 'Ruyter,'
which will take him to Egypt; for he has a note from me to the captain,
to certify that he is the person for whom I engaged and paid the passage.At the same time, he will be the bearer of this long despatch, for the
'Ruyter' is to sail in an hour, and the last letter-bag for Europe was
made up yesterday evening.But I wished to see the governor this morning,
before closing the present."Thus, then, is Prince Djalma enforced detained for a month, and, this
opportunity of the 'Ruyter' once lost, it is materially impossible that
the young Indian can be in France by the 13th of next February.You see,
therefore, that, even as you ordered, so have I acted according to the
means at my disposal--considering only the end which justifies them--for
you tell me a great interest of the society is concerned."In your hands, I have been what we all ought to be in the hands of our
superiors--a mere instrument: since, for the greater glory of God, we
become corpses with regard to the will.[7] Men may deny our unity and
power, and the times appear opposed to us; but circumstances only change;
we are ever the same."Obedience and courage, secrecy and patience, craft and audacity, union
and devotion--these become us, who have the world for our country, our
brethren for family, Rome for our Queen!About ten o'clock in the morning, Mahal the Smuggler set out with this
despatch (sealed) in his possession, to board the "Ruyter."An hour
later, the dead body of this same Mahal, strangled by Thuggee, lay
concealed beneath some reeds on the edge of a desert strand, whither he
had gone to take boat to join the vessel.When at a subsequent period, after the departure of the steamship, they
found the corpse of the smuggler, M. Joshua sought in vain for the
voluminous packet, which he had entrusted to his care.Neither was there
any trace of the note which Mahal was to have delivered to the captain of
the "Ruyter," in order to be received as passenger.Finally, the searches and bushwhacking ordered throughout the country for
the purpose of discovering Faringhea, were of no avail.The dangerous
chief of the Stranglers was never seen again in Java.[7] It is known that the doctrine of passive and absolute obedience, the
main-spring of the Society of Jesus, is summed up in those terrible words
of the dying Loyola: "Every member of the Order shall be, in the hands of
his superiors, even as a corpse (Perinde ac Cadaver)."--E.Three months have elapsed since Djalma was thrown into Batavia Prison
accused of belonging to the murderous gang of Megpunnas.The following
scene takes place in France, at the commencement of the month of
February, 1832, in Cardoville Manor House, an old feudal habitation
standing upon the tall cliffs of Picardy, not far from Saint Valery, a
dangerous coast on which almost every year many ships are totally
wrecked, being driven on shore by the northwesters, which render the
navigation of the Channel so perilous.From the interior of the Castle is heard the howling of a violent
tempest, which has arisen during the night; a frequent formidable noise,
like the discharge of artillery, thunders in the distance, and is
repeated by the echoes of the shore; it is the sea breaking with fury
against the high rocks which are overlooked by the ancient Manor House.It is about seven o'clock in the morning.Daylight is not yet visible
through the windows of a large room situated on the ground-floor.In this
apartment, in which a lamp is burning, a woman of about sixty years of
age, with a simple and honest countenance, dressed as a rich farmer's
wife of Picardy, is already occupied with her needle-work,
notwithstanding the early hour.Close by, the husband of this woman,
about the same age as herself, is seated at a large table, sorting and
putting up in bags divers samples of wheat and oats.The face of this
white-haired man is intelligent and open, announcing good sense and
honesty, enlivened by a touch of rustic humor; he wears a shooting-jacket
of green cloth, and long gaiters of tan- leather, which half
conceal his black velveteen breeches.The terrible storm which rages without renders still more agreeable the
picture of this peaceful interior.A rousing fire burns in a broad
chimney-place faced with white marble, and throws its joyous light on the
carefully polished floor; nothing can be more cheerful than the old
fashioned chintz hangings and curtains with red Chinese figures upon a
white ground, and the panels over the door painted with pastoral scenes
in the style of Watteau.A clock of Sevres china, and rosewood furniture
inlaid with green--quaint and portly furniture, twisted into all sorts of
grotesque shapes--complete the decorations of this apartment.Out-doors, the gale continued to howl furiously, and sometimes a gust of
wind would rush down the chimney, or shake the fastenings of the windows.The man who was occupied in sorting the samples of grain was M. Dupont,
bailiff of Cardoville manor.said his wife; "what dreadful weather, my dear!This M.
Rodin, who is to come here this morning, as the Princess de Saint
Dizier's steward announced to us, picked out a very bad day for it.""Why, in truth, I have rarely heard such a hurricane.If M. Rodin has
never seen the sea in its fury, he may feast his eyes to-day with the
sight.""What can it be that brings this M. Rodin, my dear?"The steward tells me in his letter to
show M. Rodin the greatest attention, and to obey him as if he were my
master.It will be for him to explain himself, and for me to execute his
orders, since he comes on the part of the princess.""By rights he should come from Mademoiselle Adrienne, as the land belongs
to her since the death of the duke her father.""Yes; but the princess being aunt to the young lady, her steward manages
Mademoiselle Adrienne's affairs--so whether one or the other, it amounts
to the same thing.""May be M. Rodin means to buy the estate.Though, to be sure, that stout
lady who came from Paris last week on purpose to see the chateau appeared
to have a great wish for it."At these words the bailiff began to laugh with a sly look."What is there to laugh at, Dupont?"asked his wife, a very good
creature, but not famous for intelligence or penetration."I laugh," answered Dupont, "to think of the face and figure of that
enormous woman: with such a look, who the devil would call themselves
Madame de la Sainte-Colombe--Mrs.A pretty saint, and a pretty
dove, truly!She is round as a hogshead, with the voice of a town-crier;
has gray moustachios like an old grenadier, and without her knowing it, I
heard her say to her servant: 'Stir your stumps, my hearty!'--and yet she
calls herself Sainte-Colombe!""How hard on her you are, Dupont; a body don't choose one's name.And, if
she has a beard, it is not the lady's fault.""No--but it is her fault to call herself Sainte-Colombe.Ah, my poor Catherine, you are yet very green in some
things.""While you, my poor Dupont, are well read in slander!The first thing she asked for on arriving was the
chapel of the Castle, of which she had heard speak.She even said that
she would make some embellishments in it; and, when I told her we had no
church in this little place, she appeared quite vexed not to have a
curate in the village."that's the first thought of your upstarts--to play the
great lady of the parish, like your titled people.""Madame de la Sainte-Colombe need not play the great lady, because she is
one.""Yes--only see how she was dressed, in scarlet gown, and violet gloves
like a bishop's; and, when she took off her bonnet, she had a diamond
band round her head-dress of false, light hair, and diamond ear-drops as
large as my thumb, and diamond rings on every finger!None of your
tuppenny beauties would wear so many diamonds in the middle of the day.""Do you mean to say there's more?""She talked of nothing but dukes, and marquises, and counts, and very
rich gentlemen, who visit at her house, and are her most intimate
friends; and then, when she saw the summer house in the park, half-burnt
by the Prussians, which our late master never rebuilt, she asked, 'What
are those ruins there?'and I answered: 'Madame, it was in the time of
the Allies that the pavilion was burnt.'--'Oh, my clear,' cried she; 'our
allies, good, dear allies!So
you see, Dupont, I said to myself directly: 'She was no doubt one of the
noble women who fled abroad--'"

"Madame de la Sainte-Colombe!"cried the bailiff, laughing heartily."Oh,
my poor, poor wife!""Oh, it is all very well; but because you have been three years at Paris,
don't think yourself a conjurer!""Catherine, let's drop it: you will make me say some folly, and there are
certain things which dear, good creatures like you need never know.""I cannot tell what you are driving at, only try to be less
slanderous--for, after all, should Madame de la Sainte-Colombe buy the
estate, will you be sorry to remain as her bailiff, eh?""Not I--for we are getting old, my good Catherine; we have lived here
twenty years, and we have been too honest to provide for our old days by
pilfering--and truly, at our age, it would be hard to seek another place,
which perhaps we should not find.What I regret is, that Mademoiselle
Adrienne should not keep the land; it seems that she wished to sell it,
against the will of the princess."is it not very extraordinary that Mademoiselle
Adrienne should have the disposal of her large fortune so early in life?"Our young lady, having no father or mother, is
mistress of her property, besides having a famous little will of her own.Dost remember, ten years ago, when the count brought her down here one
summer?--what an imp of mischief!eh?--how they
sparkled, even then!""It is true that Mademoiselle Adrienne had in her look--an expression--a
very uncommon expression for her age.""If she has kept what her witching, luring face promised, she must be
very pretty by this time, notwithstanding the peculiar color of her
hair--for, between ourselves, if she had been a tradesman's daughter,
instead of a young lady of high birth, they would have called it red."Heaven forbid--I always thought
that she would be as good as pretty, and it is not speaking ill of her to
say she has red hair.On the contrary, it always appears to me so fine,
so bright, so sunny, and to suit so well her snowy complexion and black
eyes, that in truth I would not have had it other than it was; and I am
sure, that now this very color of her hair, which would be a blemish in
any one else, must only add to the charm of Mademoiselle Adrienne's face.She must have such a sweet vixen look!"to be candid, she really was a vixen--always running about the park,
aggravating her governess, climbing the trees--in fact, playing all
manner of naughty tricks.""I grant you, Mademoiselle Adrienne was a chip of the old block; but then
what wit, what engaging ways, and above all, what a good heart!"Once I remember she gave her shawl and her
new merino frock to a poor little beggar girl, and came back to the house
in her petticoat, and bare arms.""Oh, an excellent heart--but headstrong--terribly headstrong!""Yes--that she was; and 'tis likely to finish badly, for it seems that
she does things at Paris--oh!such things--"

"What things?""Oh, my dear; I can hardly venture--"

"Fell, but what are they?""Why," said the worthy dame, with a sort of embarrassment and confusion,
which showed how much she was shocked by such enormities, "they say, that
Mademoiselle Adrienne never sets foot in a church, but lives in a kind of
heathen temple in her aunt's garden, where she has masked women to dress
her up like a goddess, and scratches them very often, because she gets
tipsy--without mentioning, that every night she plays on a hunting horn
of massive gold--all which causes the utmost grief and despair to her
poor aunt the princess."Here the bailiff burst into a fit of laughter, which interrupted his
wife."Now tell me," said he, when this first access of hilarity was over,
"where did you get these fine stories about Mademoiselle Adrienne?""From Rene's wife, who went to Paris to look for a child to nurse; she
called at Saint-Dizier House, to see Madame Grivois, her godmother.--Now
Madame Grivois is first bedchamber woman to the princess--and she it was
who told her all this--and surely she ought to know, being in the house.""Yes, a fine piece of goods that Grivois!once she was a regular bad 'un,
but now she professes to be as over-nice as her mistress; like master
like man, they say.The princess herself, who is now so stiff and
starched, knew how to carry on a lively game in her time.Fifteen years
ago, she was no such prude: do you remember that handsome colonel of
hussars, who was in garrison at Abbeville?an exiled noble who had served
in Russia, whom the Bourbons gave a regiment on the Restoration?""Yes, yes--I remember him; but you are really too backbiting.""Not a bit--I only speak the truth.The colonel spent his whole time
here, and every one said he was very warm with this same princess, who is
now such a saint.Every evening, some new
entertainment at the chateau.What a fellow that colonel was, to set
things going; how well he could act a play!--I remember--"

The bailiff was unable to proceed.A stout maid-servant, wearing the
costume and cap of Picardy, entered in haste, and thus addressed her
mistress: "Madame, there is a person here that wants to speak to master;
he has come in the postmaster's calash from Saint-Valery, and he says
that he is M.A moment after, M. Rodin made his appearance.According to his custom, he
was dressed even more than plainly.With an air of great humility, he
saluted the bailiff and his wife, and at a sign from her husband, the
latter withdrew.The cadaverous countenance of M. Rodin, his almost
invisible lips, his little reptile eyes, half concealed by their flabby
lids, and the sordid style of his dress, rendered his general aspect far
from prepossessing; yet this man knew how, when it was necessary, to
affect, with diabolical art, so much sincerity and good-nature--his words
were so affectionate and subtly penetrating--that the disagreeable
feeling of repugnance, which the first sight of him generally inspired,
wore off little by little, and he almost always finished by involving his
dupe or victim in the tortuous windings of an eloquence as pliant as it
was honeyed and perfidious; for ugliness and evil have their fascination,
as well as what is good and fair.The honest bailiff looked at this man with surprise, when he thought of
the pressing recommendation of the steward of the Princess de Saint
Dizier; he had expected to see quite another sort of personage, and,
hardly able to dissemble his astonishment, he said to him: "Is it to M.
Rodin that I have the honor to speak?""Yes, sir; and here is another letter from the steward of the Princess de
Saint-Dizier.""Pray, sir, draw near the fire, whilst I just see what is in this letter.The weather is so bad," continued the bailiff, obligingly, "may I not
offer you some refreshment?""A thousand thanks, my dear sir; I am off again in an hour."Whilst M. Dupont read, M. Rodin threw inquisitive glances round the
chamber; like a man of skill and experience, he had frequently drawn just
and useful inductions from those little appearances, which, revealing a
taste or habit, give at the same time some notion of a character; on this
occasion, however, his curiosity was at fault."Very good, sir," said the bailiff, when he had finished reading; "the
steward renews his recommendation, and tells me to attend implicitly to
your commands.""Well, sir, they will amount to very little, and I shall not trouble you
long.""It will be no trouble, but an honor.""Nay, I know how much your time must be occupied, for, as soon as one
enters this chateau, one is struck with the good order and perfect
keeping of everything in it--which proves, my dear sir, what excellent
care you take of it.""Oh, sir, you flatter me.""Flatter you?--a poor old man like myself has something else to think of.But to come to business: there is a room here which is called the Green
Chamber?""Yes, sir; the room which the late Count-Duke de Cardoville used for a
study.""You will have the goodness to take me there.""Unfortunately, it is not in my power to do so.After the death of the
Count-Duke, and when the seals were removed, a number of papers were shut
up in a cabinet in that room, and the lawyers took the keys with them to
Paris.""Here are those keys," said M. Rodin, showing to the bailiff a large and
a small key tied together."Yes--for certain papers--and also far a small mahogany casket, with
silver clasps--do you happen to know it?""Yes, sir; I have often seen it on the count's writing-table.It must be
in the large, lacquered cabinet, of which you have the key.""You will conduct me to this chamber, as authorized by the Princess de
Saint-Dizier?""Yes, sir; the princess continues in good health?""And Mademoiselle Adrienne?"said M. Rodin, with a sigh of deep contrition and
grief.has any calamity happened to Mademoiselle Adrienne?""No, no--she is, unfortunately, as well as she is beautiful."for when beauty, youth, and health are joined to an evil
spirit of revolt and perversity--to a character which certainly has not
its equal upon earth--it would be far better to be deprived of those
dangerous advantages, which only become so many causes of perdition.But
I conjure you, my dear sir, let us talk of something else: this subject
is too painful," said M. Rodin, with a voice of deep emotion, lifting the
tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye, as if to stop a
rising tear.The bailiff did not see the tear, but he saw the gesture, and he was
struck with the change in M. Rodin's voice.He answered him, therefore,
with much sympathy: "Pardon my indiscretion, sir; I really did not
know--"

"It is I who should ask pardon for this involuntary display of
feeling--tears are so rare with old men--but if you had seen, as I have,
the despair of that excellent princess, whose only fault has been too
much kindness, too much weakness, with regard to her niece--by which she
has encouraged her--but, once more, let us talk of something else, my
dear sir!"After a moment's pause, during which M. Rodin seemed to recover from his
emotion, he said to Dupont: "One part of my mission, my dear sir--that
which relates to the Green Chamber--I have now told you; but there is yet
another.Before coming to it, however, I must remind you of a
circumstance you have perhaps forgotten--namely, that some fifteen or
sixteen years ago, the Marquis d'Aigrigny, then colonel of the hussars in
garrison at Abbeville, spent some time in this house."It was only just now, that I
was talking about him to my wife.He was the life of the house!--how well
he could perform plays--particularly the character of a scapegrace.In
the Two Edmonds, for instance, he would make you die with laughing, in
that part of a drunken soldier--and then, with what a charming voice he
sang Joconde, sir--better than they could sing it at Paris!"Rodin, having listened complacently to the bailiff, said to him: "You
doubtless know that, after a fierce duel he had with a furious
Bonapartist, one General Simon, the Marquis d'Aigrigny (whose private
secretary I have now the honor to be) left the world for the church.""That fine officer--brave, noble, rich, esteemed, and
flattered--abandoned all those advantages for the sorry black gown; and,
notwithstanding his name, position, high connections, his reputation as a
great preacher, he is still what he was fourteen years ago--a plain
abbe--whilst so many, who have neither his merit nor his virtues, are
archbishops and cardinals."M. Rodin expressed himself with so much goodness, with such an air of
conviction, and the facts he cited appeared to be so incontestable, that
M. Dupont could not help exclaiming: "Well, sir, that is splendid
conduct!"said M. Rodin, with an inimitable expression of
simplicity; "it is quite a matter of course when one has a heart like M.
d'Aigrigny's.But amongst all his good qualities, he has particularly
that of never forgetting worthy people--people of integrity, honor,
conscience--and therefore, my dear M. Dupont, he has not forgotten you.""What, the most noble marquis deigns to remember--"

"Three days ago, I received a letter from him, in which he mentions your
name.""He will be there soon, if not there now.He went to Italy about three
months ago, and, during his absence, he received a very sad piece of
news--the death of his mother, who was passing the autumn on one of the
estates of the Princess de Saint-Dizier.""Yes, it was a cruel grief to him; but we must all resign ourselves to
the will of Providence!""And with regard to what subject did the marquis do me the honor to
mention my name?"First of all, you must know that this house is
sold.The bill of sale was signed the day before my departure from
Paris.""I am afraid that the new proprietors may not choose to keep me as their
bailiff."It is just on that subject that I am going
to speak to you."Knowing the interest which the marquis feels for you, I am
particularly desirous that you should keep this place, and I will do all
in my power to serve you, if--"

"Ah, sir!"cried Dupont, interrupting Rodin; "what gratitude do I not owe
you!"Now, my dear sir, you flatter me in your turn; but I ought to tell you,
that I'm obliged to annex a small condition to my support.""The person who is about to inhabit this mansion, is an old lady in every
way worthy of veneration; Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is the name of this
respectable--"

"What, sir?"said the bailiff, interrupting Rodin; "Madame de la Sainte
Colombe the lady who has bought us out?""Yes, sir, she came last week to see the estate.My wife persists that
she is a great lady; but--between ourselves--judging by certain words
that I heard her speak--"

"You are full of penetration, my dear M. Dupont.Madame de la Sainte
Colombe is far from being a great lady.I believe she was neither more
nor less than a milliner, under one of the wooden porticoes of the Palais
Royal.You see, that I deal openly with you.""And she boasted of all the noblemen, French and foreign, who used to
visit her!""No doubt, they came to buy bonnets for their wives!However, the fact
is, that, having gained a large fortune and, after being in youth and
middle age--indifferent--alas!more than indifferent to the salvation of
her soul--Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is now in a likely way to
experience grace--which renders her, as I told you, worthy of veneration,
because nothing is so respectable as a sincere repentance--always
providing it to be lasting.Now to make the good work sure and effectual,
we shall need your assistance, my dear M."A great deal; and I will explain to you how.There is no church in this
village, which stands at an equal distance from either of two parishes.Madame de la Sainte-Colombe, wishing to make choice of one of the two
clergymen, will naturally apply to you and Madame Dupont, who have long
lived in these parts, for information respecting them."in that case the choice will soon be made.The incumbent of
Danicourt is one of the best of men.""Now that is precisely what you must not say to Madame de la Sainte
Colombe.""You must, on the contrary, much praise, without ceasing, the curate of
Roiville, the other parish, so as to decide this good lady to trust
herself to his care.""And why, sir, to him rather than to the other?""Why?--because, if you and Madame Dupont succeed in persuading Madame de
la Sainte-Colombe to make the choice I wish, you will be certain to keep
your place as bailiff.I give you my word of it, and what I promise I
perform.""I do not doubt, sir, that you have this power," said Dupont, convinced
by Rodin's manner, and the authority of his words; "but I should like to
know--"

"One word more," said Rodin, interrupting him; "I will deal openly with
you, and tell you why I insist on the preference which I beg you to
support.I should be grieved if you saw in all this the shadow of an
intrigue.It is only for the purpose of doing a good action.The curate
of Roiville, for whom I ask your influence, is a man for whom M.
d'Aigrigny feels a deep interest.Though very poor, he has to support an
aged mother.Now, if he had the spiritual care of Madame de la Sainte
Colombe, he would do more good than any one else, because he is full of
zeal and patience; and then it is clear he would reap some little
advantages, by which his old mother might profit--there you see is the
secret of this mighty scheme.When I knew that this lady was disposed to
buy an estate in the neighborhood of our friend's parish, I wrote about
it to the marquis; and he, remembering you, desired me to ask you to
render him this small service, which, as you see, will not remain without
a recompense.For I tell you once more, and I will prove it, that I have
the power to keep you in your place as bailiff.""Well, sir," replied Dupont, after a moment's reflection, "you are so
frank and obliging, that I will imitate your sincerity.In the same
degree that the curate of Danicourt is respected and loved in this
country, the curate of Roiville, whom you wish me to prefer to him, is
dreaded for his intolerance--and, moreover--"

"Well, and what more?""Why, then, they say--"

"Come, what do they say?"Upon these words, M. Rodin burst into so hearty a laugh that the bailiff
was quite struck dumb with amazement--for the countenance of M. Rodin
took a singular expression when he laughed.he repeated, with
redoubled hilarity; "a Jesuit!--Now really, my dear M. Dupont, for a man
of sense, experience, and intelligence, how can you believe such idle
stories?--A Jesuit--are there such people as Jesuits?--in our time, above
all, can you believe such romance of the Jacobins, hobgoblins of the old
freedom lovers?--Come, come; I wager, you have read about them in the
Constitutionnel!""And yet, sir, they say--"

"Good heavens!what will they not say?--But wise men, prudent men like
you, do not meddle with what is said--they manage their own little
matters, without doing injury to any one, and they never sacrifice, for
the sake of nonsense, a good place, which secures them a comfortable
provision for the rest of their days.I tell you frankly, however much I
may regret it, that should you not succeed in getting the preference for
my man, you will not remain bailiff here."But, sir," said poor Dupont, "it will not be my fault, if this lady,
hearing a great deal in praise of the other curate, should prefer him to
your friend."but if, on the other hand, persons who have long lived in the
neighborhood--persons worthy of confidence, whom she will see every
day--tell Madame de la Sainte-Colombe a great deal of good of my friend,
and a great deal of harm of the other curate, she will prefer the former,
and you will continue bailiff.""But, sir--that would be calumny!"said Rodin, with an air of sorrowful and
affectionate reproach, "how can you think me capable of giving you evil
counsel?--I was only making a supposition.You wish to remain bailiff on
this estate.I offer you the certainty of doing so--it is for you to
consider and decide.""But, sir--"

"One word more--or rather one more condition--as important as the other.Unfortunately, we have seen clergymen take advantage of the age and
weakness of their penitents, unfairly to benefit either themselves or
others: I believe our protege incapable of any such baseness--but, in
order to discharge my responsibility--and yours also, as you will have
contributed to his appointment--I must request that you will write to me
twice a week, giving the most exact detail of all that you have remarked
in the character, habits, connections, pursuits, of Madame de la Sainte
Colombe--for the influence of a confessor, you see, reveals itself in the
whole conduct of life, and I should wish to be fully edified by the
proceedings of my friend, without his being aware of it--or, if anything
blameable were to strike you, I should be immediately informed of it by
this weekly correspondence.""But, sir--that would be to act as a spy?""Now, my dear M. Dupont!how can you thus brand the sweetest, most
wholesome of human desires--mutual confidence?--I ask of you nothing
else--I ask of you to write to me confidentially the details of all that
goes on here.On these two conditions, inseparable one from the other,
you remain bailiff; otherwise, I shall be forced, with grief and regret,
to recommend some one else to Madame de la Sainte-Colombe.""I beg you, sir," said Dupont, with emotion, "Be generous without any
conditions!--I and my wife have only this place to give us bread, and we
are too old to find another.Do not expose our probity of forty years'
standing to be tempted by the fear of want, which is so bad a
counsellor!""My dear M. Dupont, you are really a great child: you must reflect upon
this, and give me your answer in the course of a week."I implore you--" The conversation was here interrupted by a
loud report, which was almost instantaneously repeated by the echoes of
the cliffs.Hardly had he spoken, when the
same noise was again heard more distinctly than before."It is the sound of cannon," cried Dupont, rising; "no doubt a ship in
distress, or signaling for a pilot.""My dear," said the bailiffs wife, entering abruptly, "from the terrace,
we can see a steamer and a large ship nearly dismasted--they are drifting
right upon the shore--the ship is firing minute gulls--it will be lost."cried the bailiff, taking his hat and preparing to
go out, "to look on at a shipwreck, and be able to do nothing!""Can no help be given to these vessels?""If they are driven upon the reefs, no human power can save them; since
the last equinox two ships have been lost on this coast.""Lost with all on board?--Oh, very frightful," said M. Rodin."In such a storm, there is but little chance for the crew; no matter,"
said the bailiff, addressing his wife, "I will run down to the rocks with
the people of the farm, and try to save some of them, poor
creatures!--Light large fires in several rooms--get ready linen, clothes,
cordials--I scarcely dare hope to save any, but we must do our best."I should think it a duty, if I could be at all useful, but I am too old
and feeble to be of any service," said M. Rodin, who was by no means
anxious to encounter the storm."Your good lady will be kind enough to
show me the Green Chamber, and when I have found the articles I require,
I will set out immediately for Paris, for I am in great haste."Ring the big bell," said the
bailiff to his servant; "let all the people of the farm meet me at the
foot of the cliff, with ropes and levers.""Yes, my dear," replied Catherine; "but do not expose yourself.""Kiss me--it will bring me luck," said the bailiff; and he started at a
full run, crying: "Quick!quick; by this time not a plank may remain of
the vessels.""My dear madam," said Rodin, always impassible, "will you be obliging
enough to show me the Green Chamber?""Please to follow me, sir," answered Catherine, drying her tears--for she
trembled on account of her husband, whose courage she well knew.THE TEMPEST

The sea is raging.Mountainous waves of dark green, marbled with white
foam, stand out, in high, deep undulations, from the broad streak of red
light, which extends along the horizon.Above are piled heavy masses of
black and sulphurous vapor, whilst a few lighter clouds of a reddish
gray, driven by the violence of the wind, rush across the murky sky.The pale winter sun, before he quite disappears in the great clouds,
behind which he is slowly mounting, casts here and there some oblique
rays upon the troubled sea, and gilds the transparent crest of some of
the tallest waves.A band of snow-white foam boils and rages as far as
the eye can reach, along the line of the reefs that bristle on this
dangerous coast.Half-way up a rugged promontory, which juts pretty far into the sea,
rises Cardoville Castle; a ray of the sun glitters upon its windows; its
brick walls and pointed roofs of slate are visible in the midst of this
sky loaded with vapors.A large, disabled ship, with mere shreds of sail still fluttering from
the stumps of broken masts, drives dead upon the coast.Now she rolls her
monstrous hull upon the waves--now plunges into their trough.A flash is
seen, followed by a dull sound, scarcely perceptible in the midst of the
roar of the tempest.That gun is the last signal of distress from this
lost vessel, which is fast forging on the breakers.At the same moment, a steamer, with its long plume of black smoke, is
working her way from east to west, making every effort to keep at a
distance from the shore, leaving the breakers on her left.The dismasted
ship, drifting towards the rocks, at the mercy of the wind and tide, must
some time pass right ahead of the steamer.Suddenly, the rush of a heavy sea laid the steamer upon her side; the
enormous wave broke furiously on her deck; in a second the chimney was
carried away, the paddle box stove in, one of the wheels rendered
useless.A second white-cap, following the first, again struck the vessel
amidships, and so increased the damage that, no longer answering to the
helm, she also drifted towards the shore, in the same direction as the
ship.But the latter, though further from the breakers, presented a
greater surface to the wind and sea, and so gained upon the steamer in
swiftness that a collision between the two vessels became imminent--a new
clanger added to all the horrors of the now certain wreck.The ship was an English vessel, the "Black Eagle," homeward bound from
Alexandria, with passengers, who arriving from India and Java, via the
Red Sea, had disembarked at the Isthmus of Suez, from on board the
steamship "Ruyter."The "Black Eagle," quitting the Straits of Gibraltar,
had gone to touch at the Azores.She headed thence for Portsmouth, when
she was overtaken in the Channel by the northwester.The steamer was the
"William Tell," coming from Germany, by way of the Elbe, and bound, in
the last place, for Hamburg to Havre.These two vessels, the sport of enormous rollers, driven along by tide
and tempest, were now rushing upon the breakers with frightful speed.The
deck of each offered a terrible spectacle; the loss of crew and
passengers appeared almost certain, for before them a tremendous sea
broke on jagged rocks, at the foot of a perpendicular cliff.The captain of the "Black Eagle," standing on the poop, holding by the
remnant of a spar, issued his last orders in this fearful extremity with
courageous coolness.The smaller boats had been carried away by the
waves; it was in vain to think of launching the long-boat; the only
chance of escape in case the ship should not be immediately dashed to
pieces on touching the rocks, was to establish a communication with the
land by means of a life-line--almost the last resort for passing between
the shore and a stranded vessel.The deck was covered with passengers, whose cries and terror augmented
the general confusion.Some, struck with a kind of stupor, and clinging
convulsively to the shrouds, awaited their doom in a state of stupid
insensibility.Others wrung their hands in despair, or rolled upon the
deck uttering horrible imprecations.Here, women knelt down to pray;
there, others hid their faces in their hands, that they might not see the
awful approach of death.A young mother, pale as a specter, holding her
child clasped tightly to her bosom, went supplicating from sailor to
sailor, and offering a purse full of gold and jewels to any one that
would take charge of her son.These cries, and tears, and terror contrasted with the stern and silent
resignation of the sailors.Knowing the imminence of the inevitable
danger, some of them stripped themselves of part of their clothes,
waiting for the moment to make a last effort, to dispute their lives with
the fury of the waves; others renouncing all hope, prepared to meet death
with stoical indifference.Here and there, touching or awful episodes rose in relief, if one may so
express it, from this dark and gloomy background of despair.A young man of about eighteen or twenty, with shiny black hair, copper
<DW52> complexion, and perfectly regular and handsome features,
contemplated this scene of dismay and horror with that sad calmness
peculiar to those who have often braved great perils; wrapped in a cloak,
he leaned his back against the bulwarks, with his feet resting against
one of the bulkheads.Suddenly, the unhappy mother, who, with her child
in her arms, and gold in her hand, had in vain addressed herself to
several of the mariners, to beg them to save her boy, perceiving the
young man with the copper-<DW52> complexion, threw herself on her knees
before him, and lifted her child towards him with a burst of
inexpressible agony.The young man took it, mournfully shook his head,
and pointed to the furious waves--but, with a meaning gesture, he
appeared to promise that he would at least try to save it.Then the young
mother, in a mad transport of hope, seized the hand of the youth, and
bathed it with her tears.Further on, another passenger of the "Black Eagle," seemed animated by
sentiments of the most active pity.One would hardly have given him
five-and-twenty years of age.His long, fair locks fell in curls on
either side of his angelic countenance.He wore a black cassock and white
neck-band.Applying himself to comfort the most desponding, he went from
one to the other, and spoke to them pious words of hope and resignation;
to hear him console some, and encourage others, in language full of
unction, tenderness, and ineffable charity, one would have supposed him
unaware or indifferent to the perils that he shared.On his fine, mild features, was impressed a calm and sacred intrepidity,
a religious abstraction from every terrestrial thought; from time to
time, he raised to heaven his large blue eyes, beaming with gratitude,
love, and serenity, as if to thank God for having called him to one of
those formidable trials in which the man of humanity and courage may
devote himself for his brethren, and, if not able to rescue them at all,
at least die with them, pointing to the sky.One might almost have taken
him for an angel, sent down to render less cruel the strokes of
inexorable fate.not far from this young man's angelic beauty, there was
another being, who resembled an evil spirit!Boldly mounted on what was left of the bowsprit, to which he held on by
means of some remaining cordage, this man looked down upon the terrible
scene that was passing on the deck.A grim, wild joy lighted up his
countenance of a dead yellow, that tint peculiar to those who spring from
the union of the white race with the East.He wore only a shirt and linen
drawers; from his neck was suspended, by a cord, a cylindrical tin box,
similar to that in which soldiers carry their leave of absence.The more the danger augmented, the nearer the ship came to the breakers,
or to a collision with the steamer, which she was now rapidly
approaching--a terrible collision, which would probably cause the two
vessels to founder before even they touched the rocks--the more did the
infernal joy of this passenger reveal itself in frightful transports.He
seemed to long, with ferocious impatience, for the moment when the work
of destruction should be accomplished.To see him thus feasting with
avidity on all the agony, the terror, and the despair of those around
him, one might have taken him for the apostle of one of those sanguinary
deities, who, in barbarous countries, preside over murder and carnage.By this time the "Black Eagle," driven by the wind and waves, came so
near the "William Tell" that the passengers on the deck of the nearly
dismantled steamer were visible from the first-named vessel.The heavy sea, which stove in
the paddle-box and broke one of the paddles, had also carried away nearly
the whole of the bulwarks on that side; the waves, entering every instant
by this large opening, swept the decks with irresistible violence, and
every time bore away with them some fresh victims.Amongst the passengers, who seemed only to have escaped this danger to be
hurled against the rocks, or crushed in the encounter of the two vessels,
one group was especially worthy of the most tender and painful interest.Taking refuge abaft, a tall old man, with bald forehead and gray
moustache, had lashed himself to a stanchion, by winding a piece of rope
round his body, whilst he clasped in his arms, and held fast to his
breast, two girls of fifteen or sixteen, half enveloped in a pelisse of
reindeer-skin.A large, fallow, Siberian dog, dripping with water, and
barking furiously at the waves, stood close to their feet.These girls, clasped in the arms of the old man, also pressed close to
each other; but, far from being lost in terror, they raised their eyes to
heaven, full of confidence and ingenuous hope, as though they expected to
be saved by the intervention of some supernatural power.A frightful shriek of horror and despair, raised by the passengers of
both vessels, was heard suddenly above the roar of the tempest.At the
moment when, plunging deeply between two waves, the broadside of the
steamer was turned towards the bows of the ship, the latter, lifted to a
prodigious height on a mountain of water, remained, as it were, suspended
over the "William Tell," during the second which preceded the shock of
the two vessels.There are sights of so sublime a horror, that it is impossible to
describe them.Yet, in the midst of these catastrophes, swift as thought,
one catches sometimes a momentary glimpse of a picture, rapid and
fleeting, as if illumined by a flash of lightning.Thus, when the "Black Eagle," poised aloft by the flood, was about to
crash down upon the "William Tell," the young man with the angelic
countenance and fair, waving locks bent over the prow of the ship, ready
to cast himself into the sea to save some victim.Suddenly, he perceived
on board the steamer, on which he looked down from the summit of the
immense wave, the two girls extending their arms towards him in
supplication.They appeared to recognize him, and gazed on him with a
sort of ecstacy and religious homage!For a second, in spite of the horrors of the tempest, in spite of the
approaching shipwreck, the looks of those three beings met.The features
of the young man were expressive of sudden and profound pity; for the
maidens with their hands clasped in prayer, seemed to invoke him as their
expected Saviour.The old man, struck down by the fall of a plank, lay
helpless on the deck.A fearful mass of water dashed the "Black Eagle" down upon the "William
Tell," in the midst of a cloud of boiling foam.To the dreadful crash of
the two great bodies of wood and iron, which splintering against one
another, instantly foundered, one loud cry was added--a cry of agony and
death--the cry of a hundred human creatures swallowed up at once by the
waves!A few moments after, the fragments of the two vessels appeared in the
trough of the sea, and on the caps of the waves--with here and there the
contracted arms, the livid and despairing faces of some unhappy wretches,
striving to make their way to the reefs along the shore, at the risk of
being crushed to death by the shock of the furious breakers.While the bailiff was gone to the sea-shore, to render help to those of
the passengers who might escape from the inevitable shipwreck, M. Rodin,
conducted by Catherine to the Green Chamber, had there found the articles
that he was to take with him to Paris.After passing two hours in this apartment, very indifferent to the fate
of the shipwrecked persons, which alone absorbed the attention of the
inhabitants of the Castle, Rodin returned to the chamber commonly
occupied by the bailiff, a room which opened upon a long gallery.When he
entered it he found nobody there.Under his arm he held a casket, with
silver fastenings, almost black from age, whilst one end of a large red
morocco portfolio projected from the breast-pocket of his half buttoned
great coat.Had the cold and livid countenance of the Abbe d'Aigrigny's secretary
been able to express joy otherwise than by a sarcastic smile, his
features would have been radiant with delight; for, just then, he was
under the influence of the most agreeable thoughts.Having placed the
casket upon a table, it was with marked satisfaction that he thus
communed with himself:

"All goes well.It was prudent to keep these papers here till this
moment, for one must always be on guard against the diabolical spirit of
that Adrienne de Cardoville, who appears to guess instinctively what it
is impossible she should know.Fortunately, the time approaches when we
shall have no more need to fear her.Her fate will be a cruel one; it
must be so.Those proud, independent characters are at all times our
natural enemies--they are so by their very essence--how much more when
they show themselves peculiarly hurtful and dangerous!As for La Sainte
Colombe, the bailiff is sure to act for us; between what the fool calls
his conscience, and the dread of being at his age deprived of a
livelihood, he will not hesitate.I wish to have him because he will
serve us better than a stranger; his having been here twenty years will
prevent all suspicion on the part of that dull and narrow-minded woman.Once in the hands of our man at Roiville, I will answer for the result.The course of all such gross and stupid women is traced beforehand: in
their youth, they serve the devil; in riper years, they make others serve
him; in their old age, they are horribly afraid of him; and this fear
must continue till she has left us the Chateau de Cardoville, which, from
its isolated position, will make us an excellent college.As for the affair of the medals, the 13th of February approaches,
without news from Joshua--evidently, Prince Djalma is still kept prisoner
by the English in the heart of India, or I must have received letters
from Batavia.The daughters of General Simon will be detained at Leipsic
for at least a month longer.All our foreign relations are in the best
condition.As for our internal affairs--"

 Here M. Rodin was interrupted in the current of his reflections by the
entrance of Madame Dupont, who was zealously engaged in preparations to
give assistance in case of need."Now," said she to the servant, "light a fire in the next room; put this
warm wine there; your master may be in every minute.""Well, my dear madam," said Rodin to her, "do they hope to save any of
these poor creatures?"He is so courageous, so imprudent, if
once he thinks he can be of any service.""Courageous even to imprudence," said Rodin to himself, impatiently; "I
do not like that.""Well," resumed Catherine, "I have here at hand my hot linen, my
cordials--heaven grant it may all be of use!""We may at least hope so, my dear madam.I very much regretted that my
age and weakness did not permit me to assist your excellent husband.I
also regret not being able to wait for the issue of his exertions, and to
wish him joy if successful--for I am unfortunately compelled to depart,
my moments are precious.I shall be much obliged if you will have the
carriage got ready.""Yes, Sir; I will see about it directly.""One word, my dear, good Madame Dupont.You are a woman of sense, and
excellent judgment.Now I have put your husband in the way to keep, if he
will, his situation as bailiff of the estate--"

"Is it possible?Without this place
what would become of us at our time of life?""I have only saddled my promise with two conditions--mere trifles--he
will explain all that to you."we shall regard you as our deliverer."Only, on two little conditions--"

"If there were a hundred, sir we should gladly accept them.Think what we
should be without this place--penniless--absolutely penniless!""I reckon upon you then; for the interest of your husband, you will try
to persuade him."here's master come back," cried a servant,
rushing into the chamber."No, missus; he is alone."A few moments after, M. Dupont entered the room; his clothes were
streaming with water; to keep his hat on in the midst of the storm, he
had tied it down to his head by means of his cravat, which was knotted
under his chin; his gaiters were covered with chalky stains."There I have thee, my dear love!"cried his wife, tenderly embracing
him."Up to the present moment--THREE SAVED."said Rodin; "at least your efforts
will not have been all in vain.""I only speak of those I saw myself, near the little creek of Goelands.Let us hope there may be more saved on other parts of the coast.""Yes, indeed; happily, the shore is not equally steep in all parts.""And where are these interesting sufferers, my dear sir?"asked Rodin,
who could not avoid remaining a few instants longer."They are mounting the cliffs, supported by our people.As they cannot
walk very fast, I ran on before to console my wife, and to take the
necessary measures for their reception.First of all, my dear, you must
get ready some women's clothes.""There is then a woman amongst the persons saved?""There are two girls--fifteen or sixteen years of age at the most--mere
children--and so pretty!"said Rodin, with an affectation of interest."The person to whom they owe their lives is with them."Yes; only fancy--"

"You can tell me all this by and by.Just slip on this dry warm
dressing-gown, and take some of this hot wine."I'll not refuse, for I am almost frozen to death.I was telling you that
the person who saved these young girls was a hero; and certainly his
courage was beyond anything one could have imagined.When I left here
with the men of the farm, we descended the little winding path, and
arrived at the foot of the cliff--near the little creek of Goelands,
fortunately somewhat sheltered from the waves by five or six enormous
masses of rock stretching out into the sea.Why, the two young girls I spoke of, in a swoon, with their feet
still in the water, and their bodies resting against a rock, as though
they had been placed there by some one, after being withdrawn from the
sea."said M. Rodin, raising, as usual,
the tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye, as though to
dry a tear, which was very seldom visible."What struck me was their great resemblance to each other," resumed the
bailiff; "only one in the habit of seeing them could tell the
difference.""Twin--sisters, no doubt," said Madame Dupont."One of the poor things," continued the bailiff, "held between her
clasped hands a little bronze medal, which was suspended from her neck by
a chain of the same material."Rodin generally maintained a very stooping posture; but at these last
words of the bailiff, he drew himself up suddenly, whilst a faint color
spread itself over his livid cheeks.In any other person, these symptoms
would have appeared of little consequence; but in Rodin, accustomed for
long years to control and dissimulate his emotions, they announced no
ordinary excitement.Approaching the bailiff, he said to him in a
slightly agitated voice, but still with an air of indifference: "It was
doubtless a pious relic.Did you see what was inscribed on this medal?""No, sir; I did not think of it.""And the two young girls were like one another--very much like, you say?""So like, that one would hardly know which was which.Probably they are
orphans, for they are dressed in mourning."said M. Rodin, with another start."As they had fainted away, we carried them further on to a place where
the sand was quite dry.While we were busy about this, we saw the head of
a man appear from behind one of the rocks, which he was trying to climb,
clinging to it by one hand; we ran to him, and luckily in the nick of
time, for he was clean worn out, and fell exhausted into the arms of our
men.It was of him I spoke when I talked of a hero; for, not content with
having saved the two young girls by his admirable courage, he had
attempted to rescue a third person, and had actually gone back amongst
the rocks and breakers--but his strength failed him, and, without the aid
of our men, he would certainly have been washed away from the ridge to
which he clung."Rodin, with his head bowed upon his breast, seemed quite indifferent to
this conversation.The dismay and stupor, in which he had been plunged,
only increased upon reflection.The two girls, who had just been saved,
were fifteen years of age; were dressed in mourning; were so like, that
one might be taken for the other; one of them wore round her neck a chain
with a bronze medal; he could scarcely doubt that they were the daughters
of General Simon.But how could those sisters be amongst the number of
shipwrecked passengers?How could they have escaped from the prison at
Leipsic?How did it happen, that he had not been informed of it?Could
they have fled, or had they been set at liberty?How was it possible that
he should not be apprise of such an event?But these secondary thoughts,
which offered themselves in crowds to the mind of M. Rodin, were
swallowed up in the one fact: "the daughters of General Simon are
here!"--His plan, so laboriously laid, was thus entirely destroyed."When I speak of the deliverer of these young girls," resumed the
bailiff, addressing his wife, and without remarking M. Rodin's absence of
mind, "you are expecting no doubt to see a Hercules?--well, he is
altogether the reverse.He is almost a boy in look, with fair, sweet
face, and light, curling locks.I left him a cloak to cover him, for he
had nothing on but his shirt, black knee-breeches, and a pair of black
worsted stockings--which struck me as singular.""Why, it was certainly not a sailor's dress.""Besides, though the ship was English, I believe my hero is a Frenchman,
for he speaks our language as well as we do.What brought the tears to my
eyes, was to see the young girls, when they came to themselves.As soon
as they saw him, they threw themselves at his feet, and seemed to look up
to him and thank him, as one would pray.Then they cast their eyes around
them, as if in search of some other person, and, having exchanged a few
words, they fell sobbing into each other's arms."How many poor creatures must have
perished!""When we quitted the rocks, the sea had already cast ashore seven dead
bodies, besides fragments of the wrecks, and packages.I spoke to some of
the coast-guard, and they will remain all day on the look-out; and if, as
I hope, any more should escape with life, they are to be brought here.But surely that is the sound of voices!--yes, it is our shipwrecked
guests!"The bailiff and his wife ran to the door of the room--that door, which
opened on the long gallery--whilst Rodin, biting convulsively his flat
nails, awaited with angry impatience the arrival of the strangers.A
touching picture soon presented itself to his view.From the end of the dark some gallery, only lighted on one side by
several windows, three persons, conducted by a peasant, advanced slowly.This group consisted of the two maidens, and the intrepid young man to
whom they owed their lives.Rose and Blanche were on either side of their
deliverer, who, walking with great difficulty, supported himself lightly
on their arms.Though he was full twenty-five years of age, the juvenile countenance of
this man made him appear younger.His long, fair hair, parted on the
forehead, streamed wet and smooth over the collar of a large brown cloak,
with which he had been covered.It would be difficult to describe the
adorable expression of goodness in his pale, mild face, as pure as the
most ideal creations of Raphael's pencil--for that divine artist alone
could have caught the melancholy grace of those exquisite features, the
serenity of that celestial look, from eyes limpid and blue as those of an
archangel, or of a martyr ascended to the skies.for a blood-red halo already encircled that beauteous
head.just above his light eyebrows, and rendered
still more visible by the effect of the cold, a narrow cicatrix, from a
wound inflicted many months before, appeared to encompass his fair
forehead with a purple band; and (still more sad!)his hands had been
cruelly pierced by a crucifixion--his feet had suffered the same
injury--and, if he now walked with so much difficulty, it was that his
wounds had reopened, as he struggled over the sharp rocks.This young man was Gabriel, the priest attached to the foreign mission,
the adopted son of Dagobert's wife.He was a priest and martyr--for, in
our days, there are still martyrs, as in the time when the Caesars flung
the early Christians to the lions and tigers of the circus.Yes, in our days, the children of the people--for it is almost always
amongst them that heroic and disinterested devotion may still be
found--the children of the people, led by an honorable conviction,
because it is courageous and sincere, go to all parts of the world, to
try and propagate their faith, and brave both torture and death with the
most unpretending valor.How many of them, victims of some barbarous tribe, have perished, obscure
and unknown, in the midst of the solitudes of the two worlds!--And for
these humble soldiers of the cross, who have nothing but their faith and
their intrepidity, there is never reserved on their return (and they
seldom do return) the rich and sumptuous dignities of the church.Never
does the purple or the mitre conceal their scarred brows and mutilated
limbs; like the great majority of other soldiers, they die forgotten.[8]

In their ingenuous gratitude, the daughters of General Simon, as soon as
they recovered their senses after the shipwreck, and felt themselves able
to ascend the cliffs, would not leave to any other person the care of
sustaining the faltering steps of him who had rescued them from certain
death.The black garments of Rose and Blanche streamed with water; their faces
were deadly pale, and expressive of deep grief; the marks of recent tears
were on their cheeks, and, with sad, downcast eyes, they trembled both
from agitation and cold, as the agonizing thought recurred to them, that
they should never again see Dagobert, their friend and guide; for it was
to him that Gabriel had stretched forth a helping hand, to assist him to
climb the rocks.Unfortunately the strength of both had failed, and the
soldier had been carried away by a retreating wave.The sight of Gabriel was a fresh surprise for Rodin, who had retired on
one side, in order to observe all; but this surprise was of so pleasant a
nature, and he felt so much joy in beholding the missionary safe after
such imminent peril, that the painful impression, caused by the view of
General Simon's daughters, was a little softened.It must not be
forgotten, that the presence of Gabriel in Paris, on the 13th of
February, was essential to the success of Rodin's projects.The bailiff and his wife, who were greatly moved at sight of the orphans,
approached them with eagerness.Just then a farm-boy entered the room,
crying: "Sir!good news--two more saved from the wreck!""Blessing and praise to God for it!"asked the bailiff, hastening towards the door."There is one who can walk, and is following behind me with Justin; the
other was wounded against the rocks, and they are carrying him on a
litter made of branches.""I will run and have him placed in the room below," said the bailiff, as
he went out."Catherine, you can look to the young ladies.""And the shipwrecked man who can walk--where is he?""Here he is," said the peasant, pointing to some one who came rapidly
along the gallery; "when he heard that the two young ladies were safe in
the chateau--though he is old, and wounded in the head, he took such
great strides, that it was all I could do to get here before him."Hardly had the peasant pronounced these words, when Rose and Blanche,
springing up by a common impulse, flew to the door.They arrived there at
the same moment as Dagobert.The soldier, unable to utter a syllable, fell on his knees at the
threshold, and extended his arms to the daughters of General Simon; while
Spoil-sport, running to them licked their hands.But the emotion was too much for Dagobert; and, when he had clasped the
orphans in his arms, his head fell backward, and he would have sunk down
altogether, but for the care of the peasants.In spite of the
observations of the bailiff's wife, on their state of weakness and
agitation, the two young girls insisted on accompanying Dagobert, who was
carried fainting into an adjoining apartment.At sight of the soldier, Rodin's face was again violently contracted, for
he had till then believed that the guide of General Simon's daughters was
dead.The missionary, worn out with fatigue, was leaning upon a chair,
and had not yet perceived Rodin.A new personage, a man with a dead yellow complexion, now entered the
room, accompanied by another peasant, who pointed out Gabriel to him.This man, who had just borrowed a smock-frock and a pair of trousers,
approached the missionary, and said to him in French but with a foreign
accent: "Prince Djalma has just been brought in here.His first word was
to ask for you."cried Rodin, in a voice of thunder; for, at the
name of Djalma, he had sprung with one bound to Gabriel's side.exclaimed the missionary, falling back in surprise."M. Rodin," cried the other shipwrecked person; and from that moment, he
kept his eye fixed on the correspondent of M. Van Dael.said Gabriel, approaching Rodin with an air of
deference, not unmixed with fear.repeated Rodin, in an excited tone."Did
he not utter the name of Prince Djalma?""Yes, sir; Prince Djalma was one of the passengers on board the English
ship, which came from Alexandria, and in which we have just been wrecked.This vessel touched at the Azores, where I then was; the ship that
brought me from Charlestown having been obliged to put in there, and
being likely to remain for some time, on account of serious damage, I
embarked on board the 'Black Eagle,' where I met Prince Djalma.We were
bound to Portsmouth, and from thence my intention was to proceed to
France."This new shock had completely
paralyzed his thoughts.At length, like a man who catches at a last hope,
which he knows beforehand to be vain, he said to Gabriel: "Can you tell
me who this Prince Djalma is?""A young man as good as brave--the son of an East Indian king,
dispossessed of his territory by the English."Then, turning towards the other shipwrecked man, the missionary said to
him with anxious interest: "How is the Prince?"They are serious contusions, but they will not be mortal," answered the
other.said the missionary, addressing Rodin; "here, you
see, is another saved.""So much the better," observed Rodin, in a quick, imperious tone."I will go see him," said Gabriel, submissively."You have no orders to
give me?""Will you be able to leave this place in two or three hours,
notwithstanding your fatigue?"Gabriel only bowed in reply, and Rodin sank confounded into a chair,
while the missionary went out with the peasant.The man with the sallow
complexion still lingered in a corner of the room, unperceived by Rodin.This man was Faringhea, the half-caste, one of the three chiefs of the
Stranglers.Having escaped the pursuit of the soldiers in the ruins of
Tchandi, he had killed Mahal the Smuggler, and robbed him of the
despatches written by M. Joshua Van Dael to Rodin, as also of the letter
by which the smuggler was to have been received as passenger on board the
"Ruyter."When Faringhea left the hut in the ruins of Tchandi, he had not
been seen by Djalma; and the latter, when he met him on shipboard, after
his escape (which we shall explain by and by), not knowing that he
belonged to the sect of Phansegars, treated him during the voyage as a
fellow-countryman.Rodin, with his eye fixed and haggard, his countenance of a livid hue,
biting his nails to the quick in silent rage, did not perceive the half
caste, who quietly approached him and laying his hand familiarly on his
shoulder, said to him: "Your name is Rodin?"asked the other, starting, and raising his head abruptly."You live in the Rue du Milieu-des-Ursins, Paris?"But, once more, what do you want?""Nothing now, brother: hereafter, much!"And Faringhea, retiring, with slow steps, left Rodin alarmed at what had
passed; for this man, who scarcely trembled at anything, had quailed
before the dark look and grim visage of the Strangler.[8] We always remember with emotion the end of a letter written, two or
three years ago, by one of these young and valiant missionaries, the son
of poor parents in Beauce.He was writing to his mother from the heart of
Japan, and thus concluded his letter: "Adieu, my dear mother!they say
there is much danger where I am now sent to.Pray for me, and tell all
our good neighbors that I think of them very often."These few words,
addressed from the centre of Asia to poor peasants in a hamlet of France,
are only the more touching from their very simplicity--E. S.




CHAPTER XXVI.The most profound silence reigns throughout Cardoville House.The tempest
has lulled by degrees, and nothing is heard from afar but the hoarse
murmur of the waves, as they wash heavily the shore.Dagobert and the orphans have been lodged in warm and comfortable
apartments on the first-floor of the chateau.Djalma, too severely hurt
to be carried upstairs, has remained in a room below.At the moment of
the shipwreck, a weeping mother had placed her child in his arms.He had
failed in the attempt to snatch this unfortunate infant from certain
death, but his generous devotion had hampered his movements, and when
thrown upon the rocks, he was almost dashed to pieces.Faringhea, who has
been able to convince him of his affection, remains to watch over him.Gabriel, after administering consolation to Djalma, has rescinded to the
chamber allotted to him; faithful to the promise he made to Rodin, to be
ready to set out in two hours, he has not gone to bed; but, having dried
his clothes, he has fallen asleep in a large, high-backed arm-chair,
placed in front of a bright coal-fire.His apartment is situated near
those occupied by Dagobert and the two sisters.Spoil-sport, probably quite at his ease in so respectable a dwelling, has
quitted the door of Rose and Blanche's chamber, to lie down and warm
himself at the hearth, by the side of which the missionary is sleeping.There, with his nose resting on his outstretched paws, he enjoys a
feeling of perfect comfort and repose, after so many perils by land and
sea.We will not venture to affirm, that he thinks habitually of poor old
Jovial; unless we recognize as a token of remembrance on his part, his
irresistible propensity to bite all the white horses he has met with,
ever since the death of his venerable companion, though before, he was
the most inoffensive of dogs with regard to horses of every color.Presently one of the doors of the chamber opened, and the two sisters
entered timidly.Awake for some minutes, they had risen and dressed
themselves, feeling still some uneasiness with respect to Dagobert;
though the bailiff's wife, after showing them to their room, had returned
again to tell them that the village doctor found nothing serious in the
hurt of the old soldier, still they hoped to meet some one belonging to
the chateau, of whom they could make further inquiries about him.The high back of the old-fashioned arm-chair, in which Gabriel was
sleeping, completely screened him from view; but the orphans, seeing
their canine friend lying quietly at his feet, thought it was Dagobert
reposing there, and hastened towards him on tip-toe.To their great
astonishment, they saw Gabriel fast asleep, and stood still in confusion,
not daring to advance or recede, for fear of waking him.The long, light hair of the missionary was no longer wet, and now curled
naturally round his neck and shoulders; the paleness of his complexion
was the more striking, from the contrast afforded by the deep purple of
the damask covering of the arm-chair.His beautiful countenance expressed
a profound melancholy, either caused by the influence of some painful
dream, or else that he was in the habit of keeping down, when awake, some
sad regrets, which revealed themselves without his knowledge when he was
sleeping.Notwithstanding this appearance of bitter grief, his features
preserved their character of angelic sweetness, and seemed endowed with
an inexpressible charm, for nothing is more touching than suffering
goodness.The two young girls cast down their eyes, blushed
simultaneously, and exchanged anxious glances, as if to point out to each
other the slumbering missionary."He sleeps, sister," said Rose in a low voice."So much the better," replied Blanche, also in a whisper, making a sign
of caution; "we shall now be able to observe him well.""Yes, for we durst not do so, in coming from the sea hither.""He is just the same as we saw him in our dreams.""But here, at least, he is visible.""Not as it was in the prison at Leipsic, during that dark night.""And so--he has again rescued us.""Without him, we should have perished this morning.""And yet, sister, it seems to me, that in our dreams his countenance
shone with light.""Yes, you know it dazzled us to look at him.""And then he had not so sad a mien.""That was because he came then from heaven; now he is upon earth.""But, sister, had he then that bright red scar round his forehead?""If he has been wounded, how can he be an archangel?"If he received those wounds in preventing evil, or in
helping the unfortunate, who, like us, were about to perish?"If he did not run any danger for those he protects, it
would be less noble.""What a pity that he does not open his eye!""Their expression is so good, so tender!""Why did he not speak of our mother, by the way?""We were not alone with him; he did not like to do so.""If we were to pray to him to speak to us?"The orphans looked doubtingly at each other, with charming simplicity; a
bright glow suffused their cheeks, and their young bosoms heaved gently
beneath their black dresses.said Blanche, believing rightly, that
Rose felt exactly as she did."And yet it seems to do us good.It is as
if some happiness were going to befall us."The sisters, having approached the arm-chair on tip-toe, knelt down with
clasped hands, one to the right the other to the left of the young
priest.Turning their lovely faces towards
him, they said in a low whisper, with a soft, sweet voice, well suited to
their youthful appearance: "Gabriel!On this appeal, the missionary gave a slight start, half-opened his eyes,
and, still in a state of semi-consciousness, between sleep and waking,
beheld those two beauteous faces turned towards him, and heard two gentle
voices repeat his name.said he, rousing himself, and raising his head.It was now Gabriel's turn to blush, for he recognized the young girls he
had saved.said he to them; "you should kneel only
unto God."The orphans obeyed, and were soon beside him, holding each other by the
hand."You know my name, it seems," said the missionary with a smile."Yes--when you came from our mother."said the missionary, unable to comprehend the words of
the orphans.I saw you to-day for the first time.""Yes--do you not remember?--in our dreams.""In Germany--three months ago, for the first time.Gabriel could not help smiling at the simplicity of Rose and Blanche, who
expected him to remember a dream of theirs; growing more and more
perplexed, he repeated: "In your dreams?""Certainly; when you gave us such good advice.""And when we were so sorrowful in prison, your words, which we
remembered, consoled us, and gave us courage.""Was it not you, who delivered us from the prison at Leipsic, in that
dark night, when we were not able to see you?""What other but you would thus have come to our help, and to that of our
old friend?""We told him, that you would love him, because he loved us, although he
would not believe in angels.""And this morning, during the tempest, we had hardly any fear.""This morning--yes, my sisters--it pleased heaven to send me to your
assistance.I was coming from America, but I have never been in Leipsic.I could not, therefore, have let you out of prison.Tell me, my sisters,"
added he, with a benevolent smile, "for whom do you take me?""For a good angel whom we have seen already in dreams, sent by our mother
from heaven to protect us.""My dear sisters, I am only a poor priest.It is by mere chance, no
doubt, that I bear some resemblance to the angel you have seen in your
dreams, and whom you could not see in any other manner--for angels are
not visible to mortal eye.said the orphans, looking sorrowfully at each
other."No matter, my dear sisters," said Gabriel, taking them affectionately by
the hand; "dreams, like everything else, come from above.Since the
remembrance of your mother was mixed up with this dream, it is twice
blessed."At this moment a door opened, and Dagobert made his appearance.Up to
this time, the orphans, in their innocent ambition to be protected by an
archangel, had quite forgotten the circumstance that Dagobert's wife had
adopted a forsaken child, who was called Gabriel, and who was now a
priest and missionary.The soldier, though obstinate in maintaining that his hurt was only a
blank wound (to use a term of General Simon's), had allowed it to be
carefully dressed by the surgeon of the village, and now wore a black
bandage, which concealed one half of his forehead, and added to the
natural grimness of his features.On entering the room, he was not a
little surprised to see a stranger holding the hands of Rose and Blanche
familiarly in his own.This surprise was natural, for Dagobert did not
know that the missionary had saved the lives of the orphans, and had
attempted to save his also.In the midst of the storm, tossed about by the waves, and vainly striving
to cling to the rocks, the soldier had only seen Gabriel very
imperfectly, at the moment when, having snatched the sisters from certain
death, the young priest had fruitlessly endeavored to come to his aid.And when, after the shipwreck, Dagobert had found the orphans in safety
beneath the roof of the Manor House, he fell, as we have already stated,
into a swoon, caused by fatigue, emotion, and the effects of his
wound--so that he had again no opportunity of observing the features of
the missionary.The veteran began to frown from beneath his black bandage and thick, gray
brows, at beholding a stranger so familiar with Rose and Blanche; but the
sisters ran to throw themselves into his arms, and to cover him with
filial caresses.His anger was soon dissipated by these marks of
affection, though he continued, from time to time, to cast a suspicious
glance at the missionary, who had risen from his seat, but whose
countenance he could not well distinguish."They told us it was not
dangerous.""No, children; the surgeon of the village would bandage me up in this
manner.If my head was carbonadoes with sabre cuts, I could not have more
wrappings.They will take me for an old milksop; it is only a blank
wound, and I have a good mind to--" And therewith the soldier raised one
of his hands to the bandage."How can you be
so unreasonable--at your age?"I will do what you wish, and keep it on."Then,
drawing the sisters to one end of the room, he said to them in a low
voice, whilst he looked at the young priest from the corner of his eye:
"Who is that gentleman who was holding your hands when I came in?He has
very much the look of a curate.You see, my children, you must be on your
guard; because--"

"He?"cried both sisters at once, turning towards Gabriel."Without him,
we should not now be here to kiss you."cried the soldier, suddenly drawing up his tall figure,
and gazing full at the missionary."It is our guardian angel," resumed Blanche."Without him," said Rose, "we must have perished this morning in the
shipwreck."it is he, who--" Dagobert could say no more.With swelling heart,
and tears in his eyes, he ran to the missionary, offered him both his
hands, and exclaimed in a tone of gratitude impossible to describe: "Sir,
I owe you the lives of these two children.I feel what a debt that
service lays upon me.I will not say more--because it includes
everything!"Then, as if struck with a sudden recollection, he cried: "Stop!when I
was trying to cling to a rock, so as not to be carried away by the waves,
was it not you that held out your hand to me?Yes--that light hair--that
youthful countenance--yes--it was certainly you--now I am sure of it!""Unhappily, sir, my strength failed me, and I had the anguish to see you
fall back into the sea.""I can say nothing more in the way of thanks than what I have already
said," answered Dagobert, with touching simplicity: "in preserving these
children you have done more for me than if you had saved my own life.added the soldier, with admiration; "and so
young, with such a girlish look!""And so," cried Blanche, joyfully, "our Gabriel came to your aid also?"said Dagobert interrupting Blanche, and addressing himself to
the priest.repeated the soldier, more and more surprised.asked the soldier, with increasing
astonishment."An excellent and generous woman, whom I revere as the best of mothers:
for she had pity on me, a deserted infant, and treated me ever as her
son.""Frances Baudoin--was it not?""It was, sir," answered Gabriel, astonished in his turn."Yes, of a brave soldier--who, from the most admirable devotion, is even
now passing his life in exile--far from his wife--far from his son, my
dear brother--for I am proud to call him by that name--"

"My Agricola!--my wife!--when did you leave them?"You the father of Agricola?--Oh!I knew not, until
now," cried Gabriel, clasping his hands together, "I knew not all the
gratitude that I owed to heaven!"resumed Dagobert, in a trembling voice; "how are
they?"The accounts I received, three months ago, were excellent.""No; it is too much," cried Dagobert; "it is too much!"The veteran was
unable to proceed; his feelings stifled his words, and fell back
exhausted in a chair.And now Rose and Blanche recalled to mind that portion of their father's
letter which related to the child named Gabriel, whom the wife of
Dagobert had adopted; then they also yielded to transports of innocent
joy."Our Gabriel is the same as yours--what happiness!"he belongs to you as well as to me.Then, addressing Gabriel, the soldier added with
affectionate warmth: "Your hand, my brave boy!"Yes--that's it--thank me!--after all thou has done for us!""Does my adopted mother know of your return?"asked Gabriel, anxious to
escape from the praises of the soldier."I wrote to her five months since, but said that I should come alone;
there was a reason for it, which I will explain by and by.Does she still
live in the Rue Brise-Miche?"In that case, she must have received my letter.I wished to write to her
from the prison at Leipsic, but it was impossible.""Yes; I come straight from Germany, by the Elbe and Hamburg, and I should
be still at Leipsic, but for an event which the Devil must have had a
hand in--a good sort of devil, though.""That would be difficult, for I cannot explain it to myself.These little
ladies," he added, pointing with a smile to Rose and Blanche, "pretended
to know more about it than I did, and were continually repeating: 'It was
the angel that came to our assistance, Dagobert--the good angel we told
thee of--though you said you would rather have Spoil sport to defend
us--'"

"Gabriel, I am waiting for you," said a stern voice, which made the
missionary start.They all turned round instantly, whilst the dog uttered
a deep growl.He stood in the doorway leading to the corridor.His
features were calm and impassive, but he darted a rapid, piercing glance
at the soldier and sisters.said Dagobert, very little prepossessed in favor of
Rodin, whose countenance he found singularly repulsive."What the
mischief does he want?""I must go with him," answered Gabriel, in a tone of sorrowful
constraint.Then, turning to Rodin, he added: "A thousand pardons!cried Dagobert, stupefied with amazement, "going the very instant
we have just met?I have too much to
tell you, and to ask in return.It
will be a real treat for me."He is my superior, and I must obey him.""Your superior?--why, he's in citizen's dress.""He is not obliged to wear the ecclesiastical garb."since he is not in uniform, and there is no provost-marshal in
your troop, send him to the--"

"Believe me, I would not hesitate a minute, if it were possible to
remain.""I was right in disliking the phi of that man," muttered Dagobert between
his teeth.Then he added, with an air of impatience and vexation: "Shall
I tell him that he will much oblige us by marching off by himself?""I beg you not to do so," said Gabriel; "it would be useless; I know my
duty, and have no will but my superior's.As soon as you arrive in Paris,
I will come and see you, as also my adopted mother, and my dear brother,
Agricola."I have been a soldier, and know what subordination
is," said Dagobert, much annoyed."One must put a good face on bad
fortune.So, the day after to-morrow, in the Rue Brise-Miche, my boy; for
they tell me I can be in Paris by to-morrow evening, and we set out
almost immediately.But I say--there seems to be a strict discipline with
you fellows!""Yes, it is strict and severe," answered Gabriel, with a shudder, and a
stifled sigh."Come, shake hands--and let's say farewell for the present.After all,
twenty-four hours will soon pass away."replied the missionary, much moved, whilst he returned
the friendly pressure of the veteran's hand.added the orphans, sighing also, and with tears in
their eyes.said Gabriel--and he left the room with Rodin, who
had not lost a word or an incident of this scene.Two hours after, Dagobert and the orphans had quitted the Castle for
Paris, not knowing that Djalma was left at Cardoville, being still too
much injured to proceed on his journey.The half-caste, Faringhea,
remained with the young prince, not wishing, he said, to desert a fellow
countryman.We now conduct the reader to the Rue Brise-Miche, the residence of
Dagobert's wife.The following scenes occur in Paris, on the morrow of the day when the
shipwrecked travellers were received in Cardoville House.Nothing can be more gloomy than the aspect of the Rue Brise-Miche, one
end of which leads into the Rue Saint-Merry, and the other into the
little square of the Cloister, near the church.At this end, the street,
or rather alley--for it is not more than eight feet wide--is shut in
between immense black, muddy dilapidated walls, the excessive height of
which excludes both air and light; hardly, during the longest days of the
year, is the sun able to throw into it a few straggling beams; whilst,
during the cold damps of winter, a chilling fog, which seems to penetrate
everything, hangs constantly above the miry pavement of this species of
oblong well.It was about eight o'clock in the evening; by the faint, reddish light of
the street lamp, hardly visible through the haze, two men, stopping at
the angle of one of those enormous walls, exchanged a few words together.John travelled to the bathroom."So," said one, "you understand all about it.You are to watch in the
street, till you see them enter No."And when you see 'em enter so as to make quite sure of the game, go up
to Frances Baudoin's room--"

"Under the cloak of asking where the little humpbacked workwoman
lives--the sister of that gay girl, the Queen of the Bacchanals.""Yes--and you must try and find out her address also--from her humpbacked
sister, if possible--for it is very important.Women of her feather
change their nests like birds, and we have lost track of her.""Make yourself easy; I will do my best with Hump, to learn where her
sister hangs out.""And, to give you steam, I'll wait for you at the tavern opposite the
Cloister, and we'll have a go of hot wine on your return.""I'll not refuse, for the night is deucedly cold."This morning the water friz on my sprinkling-brush,
and I turned as stiff as a mummy in my chair at the church-door.a distributor of holy water is not always upon roses!""Luckily, you have the pickings--"

"Well, well--good luck to you!Don't forget the Fiver, the little passage
next to the dyer's shop."One proceeded to the Cloister Square; the other towards the further end
of the street, where it led into the Rue Saint-Merry.This latter soon
found the number of the house he sought--a tall, narrow building, having,
like all the other houses in the street, a poor and wretched appearance.When he saw he was right, the man commenced walking backwards and
forwards in front of the door of No.If the exterior of these buildings was uninviting, the gloom and squalor
of the interior cannot be described.5 was, in a special
degree, dirty and dilapidated.The water, which oozed from the wall,
trickled down the dark and filthy staircase.On the second floor, a wisp
of straw had been laid on the narrow landing-place, for wiping the feet
on; but this straw, being now quite rotten, only served to augment the
sickening odor, which arose from want of air, from damp, and from the
putrid exhalations of the drains.The few openings, cut at rare intervals
in the walls of the staircase, could hardly admit more than some faint
rays of glimmering light.In this quarter, one of the most populous in Paris, such houses as these,
poor, cheerless, and unhealthy, are generally inhabited by the working
classes.A dyer occupied the
ground floor; the deleterious vapors arising from his vats added to the
stench of the whole building.On the upper stories, several artisans
lodged with their families, or carried on their different trades.Up four
flights of stairs was the lodging of Frances Baudoin, wife of Dagobert.It consisted of one room, with a closet adjoining, and was now lighted by
a single candle.Agricola occupied a garret in the roof.Old grayish paper, broken here and there by the cracks covered the crazy
wall, against which rested the bed; scanty curtains, running upon an iron
rod, concealed the windows; the brick floor, not polished, but often
washed, had preserved its natural color.At one end of this room was a
round iron stove, with a large pot for culinary purposes.On the wooden
table, painted yellow, marbled with brown, stood a miniature house made
of iron--a masterpiece of patience and skill, the work of Agricola
Baudoin, Dagobert's son.A plaster crucifix hung up against the wall, surrounded by several
branches of consecrated box-tree, and various images of saints, very
coarsely, bore witness to the habits of the soldier's wife.Between the windows stood one of those old walnut-wood presses, curiously
fashioned, and almost black with time; an old arm-chair, covered with
green cotton velvet (Agricola's first present to his mother), a few rush
bottomed chairs, and a worktable on which lay several bags of coarse,
brown cloth, completed the furniture of this room, badly secured by a
worm-eaten door.The adjoining closet contained a few kitchen and
household utensils.Mean and poor as this interior may perhaps appear, it would not seem so
to the greater number of artisans; for the bed was supplied with two
mattresses, clean sheets, and a warm counterpane; the old-fashioned press
contained linen; and, moreover, Dagobert's wife occupied all to herself a
room as large as those in which numerous families, belonging to honest
and laborious workmen, often live and sleep huddled together--only too
happy if the boys and girls can have separate beds, or if the sheets and
blankets are not pledged at the pawnbroker's.Frances Baudoin, seated beside the small stove, which, in the cold and
damp weather, yielded but little warmth, was busied in preparing her son
Agricola's evening meal.Dagobert's wife was about fifty years of age; she wore a close jacket of
blue cotton, with white flowers on it, and a stuff petticoat; a white
handkerchief was tied round her head, and fastened under the chin.Her
countenance was pale and meagre, the features regular, and expressive of
resignation and great kindness.It would have been difficult to find a
better, a more courageous mother.With no resource but her labor, she had
succeeded, by unwearied energy, in bringing up not only her own son
Agricola, but also Gabriel, the poor deserted child, of whom, with
admirable devotion, she had ventured to take charge.In her youth, she had, as it were, anticipated the strength of later
life, by twelve years of incessant toil, rendered lucrative by the most
violent exertions, and accompanied by such privations as made it almost
suicidal.Then (for it was a time of splendid wages, compared to the
present), by sleepless nights and constant labor, she contrived to earn
about two shillings (fifty sous) a day, and with this she managed to
educate her son and her adopted child.At the end of these twelve years, her health was ruined, and her strength
nearly exhausted; but, at all events, her boys had wanted for nothing,
and had received such an education as children of the people can obtain.About this time, M. Francois Hardy took Agricola as an apprentice, and
Gabriel prepared to enter the priest's seminary, under the active
patronage of M. Rodin, whose communications with the confessor of Frances
Baudoin had become very frequent about the year 1820.This woman (whose piety had always been excessive) was one of those
simple natures, endowed with extreme goodness, whose self-denial
approaches to heroism, and who devote themselves in obscurity to a life
of martyrdom--pure and heavenly minds, in whom the instincts of the heart
supply the place of the intellect!The only defect, or rather the necessary consequence of this extreme
simplicity of character, was the invincible determination she displayed
in yielding to the commands of her confessor, to whose influence she had
now for many years been accustomed to submit.She regarded this influence
as most venerable and sacred; no mortal power, no human consideration,
could have prevented her from obeying it.Did any dispute arise on the
subject, nothing could move her on this point; she opposed to every
argument a resistance entirely free from passion--mild as her
disposition, calm as her conscience--but, like the latter, not to be
shaken.In a word, Frances Baudoin was one of those pure, but
uninstructed and credulous beings, who may sometimes, in skillful and
dangerous hands, become, without knowing it, the instruments of much
evil.For some time past, the bad state of her health, and particularly the
increasing weakness of her sight, had condemned her to a forced repose;
unable to work more than two or three hours a day, she consumed the rest
of her time at church.Frances rose from her seat, pushed the coarse bags at which she had been
working to the further end of the table, and proceeded to lay the cloth
for her son's supper, with maternal care and solicitude.She took from
the press a small leathern bag, containing an old silver cup, very much
battered, and a fork and spoon, so worn and thin, that the latter cut
like a knife.These, her only plate (the wedding present of Dagobert) she
rubbed and polished as well as she was able, and laid by the side of her
son's plate.They were the most precious of her possessions, not so much
for what little intrinsic value might attach to them, as for the
associations they recalled; and she had often shed bitter tears, when,
under the pressure of illness or want of employment, she had been
compelled to carry these sacred treasures to the pawnbroker's.Frances next took, from the lower shelf of the press, a bottle of water,
and one of wine about three-quarters full, which she also placed near her
son's plate; she then returned to the stove, to watch the cooking of the
supper.Though Agricola was not much later than usual, the countenance of his
mother expressed both uneasiness and grief; one might have seen, by the
redness of her eyes, that she had been weeping a good deal.After long
and painful uncertainty, the poor woman had just arrived at the
conviction that her eyesight, which had been growing weaker and weaker,
would soon be so much impaired as to prevent her working even the two or
three hours a day which had lately been the extent of her labors.Originally an excellent hand at her needle, she had been obliged, as her
eyesight gradually failed her, to abandon the finer for the coarser sorts
of work, and her earnings had necessarily diminished in proportion; she
had at length been reduced to the necessity of making those coarse bags
for the army, which took about four yards of sewing, and were paid at the
rate of two sous each, she having to find her own thread.This work,
being very hard, she could at most complete three such bags in a day, and
her gains thus amounted to threepence (six sous)!It makes one shudder to think of the great number of unhappy females,
whose strength has been so much exhausted by privations, old age, or
sickness, that all the labor of which they are capable, hardly suffices
to bring them in daily this miserable pittance.Thus do their gains
diminish in exact proportion to the increasing wants which age and
infirmity must occasion.Happily, Frances had an efficient support in her son.A first-rate
workman, profiting by the just scale of wages adopted by M. Hardy, his
labor brought him from four to five shillings a day--more than double
what was gained by the workmen of many other establishments.Admitting
therefore that his mother were to gain nothing, he could easily maintain
both her and himself.But the poor woman, so wonderfully economical that she denied herself
even some of the necessaries of life, had of late become ruinously
liberal on the score of the sacristy, since she had adopted the habit of
visiting daily the parish church.Scarcely a day passed but she had
masses sung, or tapers burnt, either for Dagobert, from whom she had been
so long separated, or for the salvation of her son Agricola, whom she
considered on the high-road to perdition.Agricola had so excellent a
heart, so loved and revered his mother, and considered her actions in
this respect inspired by so touching a sentiment, that he never
complained when he saw a great part of his week's wages (which he paid
regularly over to his mother every Saturday) disappear in pious forms.Yet now and then he ventured to remark to Frances, with as much respect
as tenderness, that it pained him to see her enduring privations
injurious at her age, because she preferred incurring these devotional
expenses.But what answer could he make to this excellent mother, when
she replied with tears: "My child, 'tis for the salvation of your father
and yours too."To dispute the efficacy of masses, would have been venturing on a
subject which Agricola, through respect for his mother's religious faith,
never discussed.He contented himself, therefore, with seeing her
dispense with comforts she might have enjoyed.THE SISTER OF THE BACCHANAL QUEEN.The person who now entered was a girl of about eighteen, short, and very
much deformed.Though not exactly a hunchback, her spine was curved; her
breast was sunken, and her head deeply set in the shoulders.Her face was
regular, but long, thin, very pale, and pitted with the small pox; yet it
expressed great sweetness and melancholy.Her blue eyes beamed with
kindness and intelligence.By a strange freak of nature, the handsomest
woman would have been proud of the magnificent hair twisted in a coarse
net at the back of her head.Though
miserably clad, the care and neatness of her dress revealed a powerful
struggle with her poverty.Notwithstanding the cold, she wore a scanty
frock made of print of an indefinable color, spotted with white; but it
had been so often washed, that its primitive design and color had long
since disappeared.In her resigned, yet suffering face, might be read a
long familiarity with every form of suffering, every description of
taunting.From her birth, ridicule had ever pursued her.We have said
that she was very deformed, and she was vulgarly called "Mother Bunch."Indeed it was so usual to give her this grotesque name, which every
moment reminded her of her infirmity, that Frances and Agricola, though
they felt as much compassion as other people showed contempt for her,
never called her, however, by any other name.Mother Bunch, as we shall therefore call her in future, was born in the
house in which Dagobert's wife had resided for more than twenty years;
and she had, as it were, been brought up with Agricola and Gabriel.There are wretches fatally doomed to misery.Mother Bunch had a very
pretty sister, on whom Perrine Soliveau, their common mother, the widow
of a ruined tradesman, had concentrated all her affection, while she
treated her deformed child with contempt and unkindness.The latter would
often come, weeping, to Frances, on this account, who tried to console
her, and in the long evenings amused her by teaching her to read and sew.Accustomed to pity her by their mother's example, instead of imitating
other children, who always taunted and sometimes even beat her, Agricola
and Gabriel liked her, and used to protect and defend her.She was about fifteen, and her sister Cephyse was about seventeen, when
their mother died, leaving them both in utter poverty.Cephyse was
intelligent, active, clever, but different to her sister; she had the
lively, alert, hoydenish character which requires air, exercise and
pleasures--a good girl enough, but foolishly spoiled by her mother.Cephyse, listening at first to Frances's good advice, resigned herself to
her lot; and, having learnt to sew, worked like her sister, for about a
year.But, unable to endure any longer the bitter privations her
insignificant earnings, notwithstanding her incessant toil, exposed her
to--privations which often bordered on starvation--Cephyse, young,
pretty, of warm temperament, and surrounded by brilliant offers and
seductions--brilliant, indeed, for her, since they offered food to
satisfy her hunger, shelter from the cold, and decent raiment, without
being obliged to work fifteen hours a day in an obscure and unwholesome
hovel--Cephyse listened to the vows of a young lawyer's clerk, who
forsook her soon after.She formed a connection with another clerk, whom
she (instructed by the examples set her), forsook in turn for a bagman,
whom she afterwards cast off for other favorites.In a word, what with
changing and being forsaken, Cephyse, in the course of one or two years,
was the idol of a set of grisettes, students and clerks; and acquired
such a reputation at the balls on the Hampstead Heaths of Paris, by her
decision of character, original turn of mind, and unwearied ardor in all
kinds of pleasures, and especially her wild, noisy gayety, that she was
termed the Bacchanal Queen, and proved herself in every way worthy of
this bewildering royalty.From that time poor Mother Bunch only heard of her sister at rare
intervals.She still mourned for her, and continued to toil hard to gain
her three-and-six a week.The unfortunate girl, having been taught sewing
by Frances, made coarse shirts for the common people and the army.For
these she received half-a-crown a dozen.They had to be hemmed, stitched,
provided with collars and wristbands, buttons, and button holes; and at
the most, when at work twelve and fifteen hours a day, she rarely
succeeded in turning out more than fourteen or sixteen shirts a week--an
excessive amount of toil that brought her in about three shillings and
fourpence a week.And the case of this poor girl was neither accidental
nor uncommon.And this, because the remuneration given for women's work
is an example of revolting injustice and savage barbarism.They are paid
not half as much as men who are employed at the needle: such as tailors,
and makers of gloves, or waistcoats, etc.--no doubt because women can
work as well as men--because they are more weak and delicate--and because
their need may be twofold as great when they become mothers.Well, Mother Bunch fagged on, with three-and-four a week.That is to say,
toiling hard for twelve or fifteen hours every day; she succeeded in
keeping herself alive, in spite of exposure to hunger, cold, and
poverty--so numerous were her privations.The word
privation expresses but weakly that constant and terrible want of all
that is necessary to preserve the existence God gives; namely, wholesome
air and shelter, sufficient and nourishing food and warm clothing.Mortification would be a better word to describe that total want of all
that is essentially vital, which a justly organized state of society
ought--yes--ought necessarily to bestow on every active, honest workman
and workwoman, since civilization has dispossessed them of all
territorial right, and left them no other patrimony than their hands.The savage does not enjoy the advantage of civilization; but he has, at
least, the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, the fish of the
sea, and the fruits of the earth, to feed him, and his native woods for
shelter and for fuel.The civilized man, disinherited of these gifts,
considering the rights of property as sacred, may, in return for his hard
daily labor, which enriches his country, demand wages that will enable
him to live in the enjoyment of health: nothing more, and nothing less.For is it living, to drag along on the extreme edge which separates life
from the grave, and even there continually struggle against cold, hunger,
and disease?And to show how far the mortification which society imposes
thus inexorably on its millions of honest, industrious laborers (by its
careless disregard of all the questions which concern the just
remuneration of labor), may extend, we will describe how this poor girl
contrived to live on three shillings and sixpence a week.Society, perhaps, may then feel its obligation to so many unfortunate
wretches for supporting, with resignation, the horrible existence which
leaves them just sufficient life to feel the worst pangs of humanity.Yes: to live at such a price is virtue!Yes, society thus organized,
whether it tolerates or imposes so much misery, loses all right to blame
the poor wretches who sell themselves not through debauchery, but because
they are cold and famishing.This poor girl spent her wages as follows:

    Six pounds of bread, second quality..0 8 1/2
    Four pails of water..0 2
    Lard or dripping (butter being out of the question)0 5
    Coarse salt..0 0 3/4
    A bushel of charcoal..0 4
    A quart of dried vegetables..0 3
    Three quarts of potatoes..0 2
    Dips..0 3 1/4
    Thread and needles..0 2 1/2

                                                       2 7

To save charcoal, Mother Bunch prepared soup only two or three times a
week at most, on a stove that stood on the landing of the fourth story.There remained nine or ten pence a week
for clothes and lodging.By rare good fortune, her situation was in one
respect an exception to the lot of many others.Agricola, that he might
not wound her delicacy, had come to a secret arrangement with the
housekeeper, and hired a garret for her, just large enough to hold a
small bed, a chair, and a table; for which the sempstress had to pay five
shillings a year.But Agricola, in fulfilment of his agreement with the
porter, paid the balance, to make up the actual rent of the garret, which
was twelve and sixpence.The poor girl had thus about eighteenpence a
month left for her other expenses.But many workwomen, whose position is
less fortunate than hers, since they have neither home nor family, buy a
piece of bread and some other food to keep them through the day; and at
night patronize the "twopenny rope," one with another, in a wretched room
containing five or six beds, some of which are always engaged by men, as
male lodgers are by far the most abundant.Yes; and in spite of the
disgust that a poor and virtuous girl must feel at this arrangement, she
must submit to it; for a lodging-house keeper cannot have separate rooms
for females.To furnish a room, however meanly, the poor workwoman must
possess three or four shillings in ready money.But how save this sum,
out of weekly earnings of a couple of florins, which are scarcely
sufficient to keep her from starving, and are still less sufficient to
clothe her?The poor wretch must resign herself to this repugnant
cohabitation; and so, gradually, the instinct of modesty becomes
weakened; the natural sentiment of chastity, that saved her from the "gay
life," becomes extinct; vice appears to be the only means of improving
her intolerable condition; she yields; and the first "man made of money,"
who can afford a governess for his children, cries out against the
depravity of the lower orders!And yet, painful as the condition of the
working woman is, it is relatively fortunate.Should work fail her for
one day, two days, what then?Should sickness come--sickness almost
always occasioned by unwholesome food, want of fresh air, necessary
attention, and good rest; sickness, often so enervating as to render work
impossible; though not so dangerous as to procure the sufferer a bed in
an hospital--what becomes of the hapless wretches then?The mind
hesitates, and shrinks from dwelling on such gloomy pictures.This inadequacy of wages, one terrible source only of so many evils, and
often of so many vices, is general, especially among women; and, again
this is not private wretchedness, but the wretchedness which afflicts
whole classes, the type of which we endeavor to develop in Mother Bunch.It exhibits the moral and physical condition of thousands of human
creatures in Paris, obliged to subsist on a scanty four shillings a week.This poor workwoman, then, notwithstanding the advantages she unknowingly
enjoyed through Agricola's generosity, lived very miserably; and her
health, already shattered, was now wholly undermined by these constant
hardships.Yet, with extreme delicacy, though ignorant of the little
sacrifice already made for her by Agricola, Mother Bunch pretended she
earned more than she really did, in order to avoid offers of service
which it would have pained her to accept, because she knew the limited
means of Frances and her son, and because it would have wounded her
natural delicacy, rendered still more sensitive by so many sorrows and
humiliations.But, singular as it may appear, this deformed body contained a loving and
generous soul--a mind cultivated even to poetry; and let us add, that
this was owing to the example of Agricola Baudoin, with whom she had been
brought up, and who had naturally the gift.This poor girl was the first
confidant to whom our young mechanic imparted his literary essays; and
when he told her of the charm and extreme relief he found in poetic
reverie, after a day of hard toil, the workwoman, gifted with strong
natural intelligence, felt, in her turn, how great a resource this would
be to her in her lonely and despised condition.One day, to Agricola's great surprise, who had just read some verses to
her, the sewing-girl, with smiles and blushes, timidly communicated to
him also a poetic composition.Her verses wanted rhythm and harmony,
perhaps; but they were simple and affecting, as a non-envenomed complaint
entrusted to a friendly hearer.From that day Agricola and she held
frequent consultations; they gave each other mutual encouragement: but
with this exception, no one else knew anything of the girl's poetical
essays, whose mild timidity made her often pass for a person of weak
intellect.This soul must have been great and beautiful, for in all her
unlettered strains there was not a word of murmuring respecting her hard
lot: her note was sad, but gentle--desponding, but resigned; it was
especially the language of deep tenderness--of mournful sympathy--of
angelic charity for all poor creatures consigned, like her, to bear the
double burden of poverty and deformity.Yet she often expressed a sincere
free-spoken admiration of beauty, free from all envy or bitterness; she
admired beauty as she admired the sun.many were the verses of
hers that Agricola had never seen, and which he was never to see.The young mechanic, though not strictly handsome, had an open masculine
face; was as courageous as kind; possessed a noble, glowing, generous
heart, a superior mind, and a frank, pleasing gayety of spirits.The
young girl, brought up with him, loved him as an unfortunate creature can
love, who, dreading cruel ridicule, is obliged to hide her affection in
the depths of her heart, and adopt reserve and deep dissimulation.She
did not seek to combat her love; to what purpose should she do so?Her well known sisterly affection for Agricola
explained the interest she took in all that concerned him; so that no one
was surprised at the extreme grief of the young workwoman, when, in 1830,
Agricola, after fighting intrepidly for the people's flag, was brought
bleeding home to his mother.Dagobert's son, deceived, like others, on
this point, had never suspected, and was destined never to suspect, this
love for him.Such was the poorly-clad girl who entered the room in which Frances was
preparing her son's supper."Is it you, my poor love," said she; "I have not seen you since morning:
have you been ill?The young girl kissed Agricola's mother, and replied: "I was very busy
about some work, mother; I did not wish to lose a moment; I have only
just finished it.I am going down to fetch some charcoal--do you want
anything while I'm out?""No, no, my child, thank you.It is half-past
eight, and Agricola is not come home."Then she added, after a sigh: "He
kills himself with work for me.Ah, I am very unhappy, my girl; my sight
is quite going.In a quarter of an hour after I begin working, I cannot
see at all--not even to sew sacks.The idea of being a burden to my son
drives me distracted.""Oh, don't, ma'am, if Agricola heard you say that--"

"I know the poor boy thinks of nothing but me, and that augments my
vexation.Only I think that rather than leave me, he gives up the
advantages that his fellow-workmen enjoy at Hardy's, his good and worthy
master--instead of living in this dull garret, where it is scarcely light
at noon, he would enjoy, like the other workmen, at very little expense,
a good light room, warm in winter, airy in summer, with a view of the
garden.not to mention that this place is so
far from his work, that it is quite a toil to him to get to it.""Oh, when he embraces you he forgets his fatigue, Mrs.Baudoin," said
Mother Bunch; "besides, he knows how you cling to the house in which he
was born.M. Hardy offered to settle you at Plessy with Agricola, in the
building put up for the workmen.""Yes, my child; but then I must give up church."But--be easy, I hear him," said the hunchback, blushing.A sonorous, joyous voice was heard singing on the stairs."At least, I'll not let him see that I have been crying," said the good
mother, drying her tears."This is the only moment of rest and ease from
toil he has--I must not make it sad to him."Our blacksmith poet, a tall young man, about four-and-twenty years of
age, was alert and robust, with ruddy complexion, dark hair and eyes, and
aquiline nose, and an open, expressive countenance.His resemblance to
Dagobert was rendered more striking by the thick brown moustache which he
wore according to the fashion; and a sharp-pointed imperial covered his
chin.His cheeks, however, were shaven, Olive color velveteen trousers, a
blue blouse, bronzed by the forge smoke, a black cravat, tied carelessly
round his muscular neck, a cloth cap with a narrow vizor, composed his
dress.The only thing which contrasted singularly with his working
habiliments was a handsome purple flower, with silvery pistils, which he
held in his hand."Good-evening, mother," said he, as he came to kiss Frances immediately.Then, with a friendly nod, he added, "Good-evening, Mother Bunch.""You are very late, my child," said Frances, approaching the little stove
on which her son's simple meal was simmering; "I was getting very
anxious.""Anxious about me, or about my supper, dear mother?"you won't excuse me for keeping the nice little supper
waiting that you get ready for me, for fear it should be spoilt, eh?"So saying, the blacksmith tried to kiss his mother again."Have done, you naughty boy; you'll make me upset the pan.""That would be a pity, mother; for it smells delightfully."I'll swear, now, you have some of the fried potatoes and bacon I'm so
fond of."said Frances, in a tone of mild reproach."True," rejoined Agricola, exchanging a smile of innocent cunning with
Mother Bunch; "but, talking of Saturday, mother, here are my wages.""Thank ye, child; put the money in the cupboard."cried the young sempstress, just as Agricola was about to put
away the money, "what a handsome flower you have in your hand, Agricola."See there, mother," said Agricola, taking the flower to her; "look at
it, admire it, and especially smell it.You can't have a sweeter perfume;
a blending of vanilla and orange blossom.""Indeed, it does smell nice, child.said
Frances, admiringly; "where did you find it?"repeated Agricola, smilingly: "do you think
folks pick up such things between the Barriere du Maine and the Rue
Brise-Miche?"inquired the sewing girl, sharing in Frances's
curiosity.Well, I'll satisfy you, and explain why I
came home so late; for something else detained me.It has been an evening
of adventures, I promise you.I was hurrying home, when I heard a low,
gentle barking at the corner of the Rue de Babylone; it was just about
dusk, and I could see a very pretty little dog, scarce bigger than my
fist, black and tan, with long, silky hair, and ears that covered its
paws.""Lost, poor thing, I warrant," said Frances.I took up the poor thing, and it began to lick my hands.Round its neck was a red satin ribbon, tied in a large bow; but as that
did not bear the master's name, I looked beneath it, and saw a small
collar, made of a gold plate and small gold chains.So I took a Lucifer
match from my 'bacco-box, and striking a light, I read, 'FRISKY belongs
to Hon.Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, No."Why, you were just in the street," said Mother Bunch.Taking the little animal under my arm, I looked about me till I
came to a long garden wall, which seemed to have no end, and found a
small door of a summer-house, belonging no doubt to the large mansion at
the other end of the park; for this garden looked just like a park.So,
looking up I saw 'No.7,' newly painted over a little door with a grated
slide.I rang; and in a few minutes, spent, no doubt, in observing me
through the bars (for I am sure I saw a pair of eyes peeping through),
the gate opened.And now, you'll not believe a word I have to say."said Mother Bunch, as if she was really her namesake of
elfish history.I am quite astounded, even now, at my
adventure; it is like the remembrance of a dream.""Well, let us have it," said the worthy mother, so deeply interested that
she did not perceive her son's supper was beginning to burn."First," said the blacksmith, smiling at the curiosity he had excited, "a
young lady opened the door to me, but so lovely, so beautifully and
gracefully dressed, that you would have taken her for a beautiful
portrait of past times.Before I could say a word, she exclaimed, 'Ah!dear me, sir, you have brought back Frisky; how happy Miss Adrienne will
be!Come, pray come in instantly; she would so regret not having an
opportunity to thank you in person!'And without giving me time to reply,
she beckoned me to follow her.Oh, dear mother, it is quite out of my
power to tell you, the magnificence I saw, as I passed through a small
saloon, partially lighted, and full of perfume!A door opened,--Oh, such a sight!I
was so dazzled I can remember nothing but a great glare of gold and
light, crystal and flowers; and, amidst all this brilliancy, a young lady
of extreme beauty--ideal beauty; but she had red hair, or rather hair
shining like gold!She had black eyes, ruddy lips, and her skin seemed white as
snow.This is all I can recollect: for, as I said before, I was so
dazzled, I seemed to be looking through a veil.'Madame,' said the young
woman, whom I never should have taken for a lady's-maid, she was dressed
so elegantly, 'here is Frisky.This gentleman found him, and brought him
back.''Oh, sir,' said the young lady with the golden hair, in a sweet
silvery voice, 'what thanks I owe you!I am foolishly attached to
Frisky.'Then, no doubt, concluding from my dress that she ought to thank
me in some other way than by words, she took up a silk purse, and said to
me, though I must confess with some hesitation--'No doubt, sir, it gave
you some trouble to bring my pet back.You have, perhaps, lost some
valuable time--allow me--' She held forth her purse.""Oh, Agricola," said Mother Bunch, sadly; "how people may be deceived!""Hear the end, and you will perhaps forgive the young lady.Seeing by my
looks that the offer of the purse hurt me, she took a magnificent
porcelain vase that contained this flower, and, addressing me in a tone
full of grace and kindness, that left me room to guess that she was vexed
at having wounded me, she said--'At least, sir, you will accept this
flower.'""You are right, Agricola," said the girl, smiling sadly; "an involuntary
error could not be repaired in a nicer way."Worthy young lady," said Frances, wiping her eyes; "how well she
understood my Agricola!"But just as I was taking the flower, without daring
to raise my eyes (for, notwithstanding the young lady's kind manner,
there was something very imposing about her) another handsome girl, tall
and dark, and dressed to the top of fashion, came in and said to the
red-haired young lady, 'He is here, Madame.'She immediately rose and
said to me, 'A thousand pardons, sir.I shall never forget that I am
indebted to you for a moment of much pleasure.Pray remember, on all
occasions, my address and name--Adrienne de Cardoville.'I could not find a word to say in reply.The same young
woman showed me to the door, and curtseyed to me very politely.And there
I stood in the Rue de Babylone, as dazzled and astonished as if I had
come out of an enchanted palace.""Indeed, my child, it is like a fairy tale."Yes, ma'am," said Mother Bunch, in an absent manner that Agricola did
not observe."What affected me most," rejoined Agricola, "was, that the young lady, on
seeing her little dog, did not forget me for it, as many would have done
in her place, and took no notice of it before me.That shows delicacy and
feeling, does it not?Indeed, I believe this young lady to be so kind and
generous, that I should not hesitate to have recourse to her in any
important case.""Yes, you are right," replied the sempstress, more and more absent.She felt no jealousy, no hatred,
towards this young stranger, who, from her beauty, wealth, and delicacy,
seemed to belong to a sphere too splendid and elevated to be even within
the reach of a work, girl's vision; but, making an involuntary comparison
of this fortunate condition with her own, the poor thing had never felt
more cruelly her deformity and poverty.Yet such were the humility and
gentle resignation of this noble creature, that the only thing which made
her feel ill-disposed towards Adrienne de Cardoville was the offer of the
purse to Agricola; but then the charming way in which the young lady had
atoned for her error, affected the sempstress deeply.She could not restrain her tears as she contemplated the
magnificent flower--so rich in color and perfume, which, given by a
charming hand, was doubtless very precious to Agricola."Now, mother," resumed the young man smilingly, and unaware of the
painful emotion of the other bystander, "you have had the cream of my
adventures first.I have told you one of the causes of my delay; and now
for the other.Just now, as I was coming in, I met the dyer at the foot
of the stairs, his arms a beautiful pea-green.Stopping me he said, with
an air full of importance, that he thought he had seen a chap sneaking
about the house like a spy, 'Well, what is that to you, Daddy Loriot?'said I: 'are you afraid he will nose out the way to make the beautiful
green, with which you are dyed up to the very elbows?'""But who could that man be, Agricola?""On my word, mother, I don't know and scarcely care; I tried to persuade
Daddy Loriot, who chatters like a magpie, to return to his cellar, since
it could signify as little to him as to me, whether a spy watched him or
not."So saying, Agricola went and placed the little leathern sack,
containing his wages, on a shelf, in the cupboard.As Frances put down the saucepan on the end of the table, Mother Bunch,
recovering from her reverie, filled a basin with water, and, taking it to
the blacksmith, said to him in a gentle tone-"Agricola--for your hands."Then with a most unaffected
gesture and tone, he added, "There is my fine flower for your trouble."cried the sempstress, with emotion, while a vivid
blush  her pale and interesting face."Do you give me this
handsome flower, which a lovely rich young lady so kindly and graciously
gave you?"And the poor thing repeated, with growing astonishment, "Do
you give it to me?""What the deuce should I do with it?Wear it on my heart, have it set as
a pin?""It is true I was very much impressed by
the charming way in which the young lady thanked me.I am delighted to
think I found her little dog, and very happy to be able to give you this
flower, since it pleases you.You see the day has been a happy one."While Mother Bunch, trembling with pleasure, emotion, and surprise, took
the flower, the young blacksmith washed his hands, so black with smoke
and steel filings that the water became dark in an instant.Agricola,
pointing out this change to the sempstress, said to her in a whisper,
laughing,-"Here's cheap ink for us paper-stainers!I finished some verses
yesterday, which I am rather satisfied with.With this, Agricola wiped his hands naturally on the front of his blouse,
while Mother Bunch replaced the basin on the chest of drawers, and laid
the flower against the side of it."Can't you ask for a towel," said Frances, shrugging her shoulders,
"instead of wiping your hands on your blouse?""After being scorched all day long at the forge, it will be all the
better for a little cooling to-night, won't it?Scold me, then, if you dare!Frances made no reply; but, placing her hands on either side of her son's
head, so beautiful in its candor, resolution and intelligence, she
surveyed him for a moment with maternal pride, and kissed him repeatedly
on the forehead."Come," said she, "sit down: you stand all day at your forge, and it is
late.""So,--your arm-chair again!"said Agricola.--"Our usual quarrel every
evening--take it away, I shall be quite as much at ease on another."You ought at least to rest after your hard toil.""Well, I preach like a
good apostle; but I am quite at ease in your arm-chair, after all.Since
I sat down on the throne in the Tuileries, I have never had a better
seat."Frances Baudoin, standing on one side of the table, cut a slice of bread
for her son, while Mother Bunch, on the other, filled his silver mug.There was something affecting in the attentive eagerness of the two
excellent creatures, for him whom they loved so tenderly."Thank you, Agricola," replied the sempstress, looking down, "I have only
just dined.""Oh, I only ask you for form's sake--you have your whims--we can never
prevail on you to eat with us--just like mother; she prefers dining all
alone; and in that way she deprives herself without my knowing it."It is better for my health to dine early.Oh, I am very fond of
stockfish; I should have been born a Newfoundland fisherman."This worthy lad, on the contrary, was but poorly refreshed, after a hard
day's toil, with this paltry stew,--a little burnt as it had been, too,
during his story; but he knew he pleased his mother by observing the fast
without complaining.He affected to enjoy his meal; and the good woman
accordingly observed with satisfaction:

"Oh, I see you like it, my dear boy; Friday and Saturday next we'll have
some more.""Thank you, mother,--only not two days together.One gets tired of
luxuries, you know!And now, let us talk of what we shall do
to-morrow--Sunday.We must be very merry, for the last few days you seem
very sad, dear mother, and I can't make it out--I fancy you are not
satisfied with me.""Oh, my dear child!--you--the pattern of--"

"Well, well!Prove to me that you are happy, then, by taking a little
amusement.Perhaps you will do us the honor of accompanying us, as you
did last time," added Agricola, bowing to Mother Bunch.The latter blushed and looked down; her face assumed an expression of
bitter grief, and she made no reply."I have the prayers to attend all day, you know, my dear child," said
Frances to her son.I don't propose the theatre; but they say
there is a conjurer to be seen whose tricks are very amusing."I am obliged to you, my son; but that is a kind of theatre.""My dear child, do I ever hinder others from doing what they like?"Well, then, if it should be fine, we will
simply take a walk with Mother Bunch on the Boulevards.It is nearly
three months since she went out with us; and she never goes out without
us.""No, no; go alone, my child."You know very well, Agricola," said the sempstress, blushing up to the
eyes, "that I ought not to go out with you and your mother again."May I ask, without impropriety, the cause of this
refusal?"The poor girl smiled sadly, and replied, "Because I will not expose you
to a quarrel on my account, Agricola.""Forgive me," said Agricola, in a tone of sincere grief, and he struck
his forehead vexedly.To this Mother Bunch alluded sometimes, but very rarely, for she observed
punctilious discretion.The girl had gone out with Agricola and his
mother.Such occasions were, indeed, holidays for her.Many days and
nights had she toiled hard to procure a decent bonnet and shawl, that she
might not do discredit to her friends.The five or six days of holidays,
thus spent arm in arm with him whom she adored in secret, formed the sum
of her happy days.Taking their last walk, a coarse, vulgar man elbowed her so rudely that
the poor girl could not refrain from a cry of terror, and the man
retorted it by saying,-"What are you rolling your hump in my way for,
stoopid?"Agricola, like his father, had the patience which force and courage give
to the truly brave; but he was extremely quick when it became necessary
to avenge an insult.Irritated at the vulgarity of this man, Agricola
left his mother's arm to inflict on the brute, who was of his own age,
size, and force, two vigorous blows, such as the powerful arm and huge
fist of a blacksmith never before inflicted on human face.The villain
attempted to return it, and Agricola repeated the correction, to the
amusement of the crowd, and the fellow slunk away amidst a deluge of
hisses.This adventure made Mother Bunch say she would not go out with
Agricola again, in order to save him any occasion of quarrel.We may
conceive the blacksmith's regret at having thus unwittingly revived the
memory of this circumstance,--more painful, alas!for Mother Bunch than
Agricola could imagine, for she loved him passionately, and her infirmity
had been the cause of that quarrel.Notwithstanding his strength and
resolution, Agricola was childishly sensitive; and, thinking how painful
that thought must be to the poor girl, a large tear filled his eyes, and,
holding out his hands, he said, in a brotherly tone, "Forgive my
heedlessness!And he gave her thin, pale cheeks two
hearty kisses.The poor girl's lips turned pale at this cordial caress; and her heart
beat so violently that she was obliged to lean against the corner of the
table."Come, you forgive me, do you not?"she said, trying to subdue her emotion; "but the recollection
of that quarrel pains me--I was so alarmed on your account; if the crowd
had sided with that man!"said Frances, coming to the sewing-girl's relief, without knowing
it, "I was never so afraid in all my life!""Oh, mother," rejoined Agricola, trying to change a conversation which
had now become disagreeable for the sempstress, "for the wife of a horse
grenadier of the Imperial Guard, you have not much courage.Oh, my brave
father; I can't believe he is really coming!The very thought turns me
topsy-turvy!""Heaven grant he may come," said Frances, with a sigh.Lord knows, you
have had masses enough said for his return.""Agricola, my child," said Frances, interrupting her son, and shaking her
head sadly, "do not speak in that way.Besides, you are talking of your
father.""Well, I'm in for it this evening.'Tis your turn now; positively, I am
growing stupid, or going crazy.That's the
only word I can get out to-night.You know that, when I do let out on
certain subjects, it is because I can't help it; for I know well the pain
it gives you.""You do not offend me, my poor, dear, misguided boy.""It comes to the same thing; and there is nothing so bad as to offend
one's mother; and, with respect to what I said about father's return, I
do not see that we have any cause to doubt it.""But we have not heard from him for four months.""You know, mother, in his letter--that is, in the letter which he
dictated (for you remember that, with the candor of an old soldier, he
told us that, if he could read tolerably well, he could not write); well,
in that letter he said we were not to be anxious about him; that he
expected to be in Paris about the end of January, and would send us word,
three or four days before, by what road he expected to arrive, that I
might go and meet him.""True, my child; and February is come, and no news yet.""The greater reason why we should wait patiently.But I'll tell you more:
I should not be surprised if our good Gabriel were to come back about the
same time.His last letter from America makes me hope so.What pleasure,
mother, should all the family be together!""And that day will soon come, trust me.""Do you remember your father, Agricola?""To tell the truth, I remember most his great grenadier's shako and
moustache, which used to frighten me so, that nothing but the red ribbon
of his cross of honor, on the white facings of his uniform, and the
shining handle of his sabre, could pacify me; could it, mother?What he must suffer at being separated from us at
his age--sixty and past!my child, my heart breaks, when I think
that he comes home only to change one kind of poverty for another."Isn't there a room here for you and for him;
and a table for you too?Only, my good mother, since we are talking of
domestic affairs," added the blacksmith, imparting increased tenderness
to his tone, that he might not shock his mother, "when he and Gabriel
come home, you won't want to have any more masses said, and tapers burned
for them, will you?Well, that saving will enable father to have tobacco
to smoke, and his bottle of wine every day.Then, on Sundays, we will
take a nice dinner at the eating-house."Instead of doing so, some one half-opened the door,
and, thrusting in an arm of a pea-green color, made signs to the
blacksmith."'Tis old Loriot, the pattern of dyers," said Agricola; "come in, Daddy,
no ceremony.""Impossible, my lad; I am dripping with dye from head to foot; I should
cover missus's floor with green."It will remind me of the fields I like so much.""Without joking, Agricola, I must speak to you immediately."Oh, be easy; what's he to us?""No; I think he's gone; at any rate, the fog is so thick I can't see him.But that's not it--come, come quickly!It is very important," said the
dyer, with a mysterious look; "and only concerns you.""Go and see, my child," said Frances."Yes, mother; but the deuce take me if I can make it out."And the blacksmith left the room, leaving his mother with Mother Bunch.In five minutes Agricola returned; his face was pale and agitated--his
eyes glistened with tears, and his hands trembled; but his countenance
expressed extraordinary happiness and emotion.He stood at the door for a
moment, as if too much affected to accost his mother.Frances's sight was so bad that she did not immediately perceive the
change her son's countenance had undergone."Well, my child--what is it?"Before the blacksmith could reply, Mother Bunch, who had more
discernment, exclaimed: "Goodness, Agricola--how pale you are!"Mother," said the artisan, hastening to Frances, without replying to the
sempstress,--"mother, expect news that will astonish you; but promise me
you will be calm."Mother Bunch was
right--you are quite pale."and Agricola, kneeling before Frances, took both her
hands in his--"you must--you do not know,--but--"

The blacksmith could not go on.'What is the matter?--you
terrify me!""Oh, no, I would not terrify you; on the contrary," said Agricola, drying
his eyes--"you will be so happy.But, again, you must try and command
your feelings, for too much joy is as hurtful as too much grief.""Did I not say true, when I said he would come?"She rose from her seat; but her surprise and
emotion were so great that she put one hand to her heart to still its
beating, and then she felt her strength fail.Her son sustained her, and
assisted her to sit down.Mother Bunch, till now, had stood discreetly apart, witnessing from a
distance the scene which completely engrossed Agricola and his mother.But she now drew near timidly, thinking she might be useful; for Frances
changed color more and more."Come, courage, mother," said the blacksmith; "now the shock is over, you
have only to enjoy the pleasure of seeing my father."Oh, I cannot believe it,"
said Frances, bursting into tears."So true, that if you will promise me to keep as calm as you can, I will
tell you when you may see him.""He may arrive any minute--to-morrow--perhaps to-day."Well, I must tell you all--he has arrived.""He--he is--" Frances could not articulate the word.Before coming up, he sent the dyer to
apprise me that I might prepare you; for my brave father feared the
surprise might hurt you.""And now," cried the blacksmith, in an accent of indescribable joy--"he
is there, waiting!for the last ten minutes I have scarcely
been able to contain myself--my heart is bursting with joy."And running
to the door, he threw it open.Dagobert, holding Rose and Blanche by the hand, stood on the threshold.Instead of rushing to her husband's arms, Frances fell on her knees in
prayer.She thanked heaven with profound gratitude for hearing her
prayers, and thus accepting her offerings.During a second, the actors of
this scene stood silent and motionless.Agricola, by a sentiment of
respect and delicacy, which struggled violently with his affection, did
not dare to fall on his father's neck.He waited with constrained
impatience till his mother had finished her prayer.The soldier experienced the same feeling as the blacksmith; they
understood each other.The first glance exchanged by father and son
expressed their affection--their veneration for that excellent woman, who
in the fulness of her religious fervor, forgot, perhaps, too much the
creature for the Creator.Rose and Blanche, confused and affected, looked with interest on the
kneeling woman; while Mother Bunch, shedding in silence tears of joy at
the thought of Agricola's happiness, withdrew into the most obscure
corner of the room, feeling that she was a stranger, and necessarily out
of place in that family meeting.Frances rose, and took a step towards
her husband, who received her in his arms.There was a moment of solemn
silence.Dagobert and Frances said not a word.Nothing could be heard but
a few sighs, mingled with sighs of joy.And, when the aged couple looked
up, their expression was calm, radiant, serene; for the full and complete
enjoyment of simple and pure sentiments never leaves behind a feverish
and violent agitation."My children," said the soldier, in tones of emotion, presenting the
orphans to Frances, who, after her first agitation, had surveyed them
with astonishment, "this is my good and worthy wife; she will be to the
daughters of General Simon what I have been to them.""Then, madame, you will treat us as your children," said Rose,
approaching Frances with her sister.cried Dagobert's wife, more and more
astonished."Yes, my dear Frances; I have brought them from afar not without some
difficulty; but I will tell you that by and by."One would take them for two angels, exactly alike!"said Frances, contemplating the orphans with as much interest as
admiration."Now--for us," cried Dagobert, turning to his son.We must renounce all attempts to describe the wild joy of Dagobert and
his son, and the crushing grip of their hands, which Dagobert interrupted
only to look in Agricola's face; while he rested his hands on the young
blacksmith's broad shoulders that he might see to more advantage his
frank masculine countenance, and robust frame.Then he shook his hand
again, exclaiming, "He's a fine fellow--well built--what a good-hearted
look he has!"From a corner of the room Mother Bunch enjoyed Agricola's happiness; but
she feared that her presence, till then unheeded, would be an intrusion.She wished to withdraw unnoticed, but could not do so.Dagobert and his
son were between her and the door; and she stood unable to take her eyes
from the charming faces of Rose and Blanche.She had never seen anything
so winsome; and the extraordinary resemblance of the sisters increased
her surprise.Then, their humble mourning revealing that they were poor,
Mother Bunch involuntarily felt more sympathy towards them.They are cold; their little hands are frozen, and,
unfortunately, the fire is out," said Frances, She tried to warm the
orphans' hands in hers, while Dagobert and his son gave themselves up to
the feelings of affection, so long restrained.As soon as Frances said that the fire was out, Mother Bunch hastened to
make herself useful, as an excuse for her presence; and, going to the
cupboard, where the charcoal and wood were kept, she took some small
pieces, and, kneeling before the stove, succeeded, by the aid of a few
embers that remained, in relighting the fire, which soon began to draw
and blaze.Filling a coffee-pot with water, she placed it on the stove,
presuming that the orphans required some warm drink.The sempstress did
all this with so much dexterity and so little noise--she was naturally so
forgotten amidst the emotions of the scene--that Frances, entirely
occupied with Rose and Blanche, only perceived the fire when she felt its
warmth diffusing round, and heard the boiling water singing in the
coffee-pot.This phenomenon--fire rekindling of itself--did not astonish
Dagobert's wife then, so wholly was she taken up in devising how she
could lodge the maidens; for Dagobert as we have seen, had not given her
notice of their arrival.Suddenly a loud bark was heard three or four times at the door.there's Spoil-sport," said Dagobert, letting in his dog; "he
wants to come in to brush acquaintance with the family too."The dog came in with a bound, and in a second was quite at home.After
having rubbed Dagobert's hand with his muzzle, he went in turns to greet
Rose and Blanche, and also Frances and Agricola; but seeing that they
took but little notice of him, he perceived Mother Bunch, who stood
apart, in an obscure corner of the room, and carrying out the popular
saying, "the friends of our friends are our friends," he went and licked
the hands of the young workwoman, who was just then forgotten by all.By
a singular impulse, this action affected the girl to tears; she patted
her long, thin, white hand several times on the head of the intelligent
dog.Then, finding that she could be no longer useful (for she had done
all the little services she deemed in her power), she took the handsome
flower Agricola had given her, opened the door gently, and went away so
discreetly that no one noticed her departure.After this exchange of
mutual affection, Dagobert, his wife, and son, began to think of the
realities of life."Poor Frances," said the soldier, glancing at Rose and Blanche, "you did
not expect such a pretty surprise!""I am only sorry, my friend," replied Frances, "that the daughters of
General Simon will not have a better lodging than this poor room; for
with Agricola's garret--"

"It composes our mansion," interrupted Dagobert; "there are handsomer, it
must be confessed.But be at ease; these young ladies are drilled into
not being hard to suit on that score.To-morrow, I and my boy will go arm
and arm, and I'll answer for it he won't walk the more upright and
straight of the two, and find out General Simon's father, at M. Hardy's
factory, to talk about business.""To-morrow," said Agricola to Dagobert, "you will not find at the factory
either M. Hardy or Marshall Simon's father.""What is that you say, my lad?"cried Dagobert, hastily, "the Marshal!""To be sure; since 1830, General Simon's friends have secured him the
title and rank which the emperor gave him at the battle of Ligny."cried Dagobert, with emotion, "but that ought not to surprise
me; for, after all, it is just; and when the emperor said a thing, the
least they can do is to let it abide.But it goes all the same to my
heart; it makes me jump again."Addressing the sisters, he said: "Do you hear that, my children?You
arrive in Paris the daughters of a Duke and Marshal of France.One would
hardly think it, indeed, to see you in this room, my poor little
duchesses!Ah, father Simon must have
been very glad to hear that his son was restored to his rank!"He told us he would renounce all kinds of ranks and titles to see his
son again; for it was during the general's absence that his friends
obtained this act of justice.But they expect Marshal Simon every moment,
for the last letter from India announced his departure."At these words Rose and Blanche looked at each other; and their eyes
filled with tears.These children rely on his return; but why shall we
not find M. Hardy and father Simon at the factory to-morrow?""Ten days ago, they went to examine and study an English mill established
in the south; but we expect them back every day."that's vexing; I relied on seeing the general's father, to
talk over some important matters with him.At any rate, they know where
to write to him.So to-morrow you will let him know, my lad, that his
granddaughters are arrived.In the mean time, children," added the
soldier, to Rose and Blanche, "my good wife will give you her bed and you
must put up with the chances of war.they will not be worse
off here than they were on the journey.""You know we shall always be well off with you and madame," said Rose."Besides, we only think of the pleasure of being at length in Paris,
since here we are to find our father," added Blanche."That hope gives you patience, I know," said Dagobert, "but no matter!After all you have heard about it, you ought to be finely surprised, my
children.As yet, you have not found it the golden city of your dreams,
by any means.But, patience, patience; you'll find Paris not so bad as it
looks.""Besides," said Agricola, "I am sure the arrival of Marshal Simon in
Paris will change it for you into a golden city.""You are right, Agricola," said Rose, with a smile, "you have, indeed,
guessed us.""Certainly, Agricola, we often talked about you with Dagobert; and
latterly, too, with Gabriel," added Blanche.cried Agricola and his mother, at the same time."Yes," replied Dagobert, making a sign of intelligence to the orphans,
"we have lots to tell you for a fortnight to come; and among other
things, how we chanced to meet with Gabriel.All I can now say is that,
in his way, he is quite as good as my boy (I shall never be tired of
saying'my boy'); and they ought to love each other like brothers.Oh, my
brave, brave wife!"said Dagobert, with emotion, "you did a good thing,
poor as you were, taking the unfortunate child--and bringing him up with
your own.""Don't talk so much about it, my dear; it was such a simple thing.""You are right; but I'll make you amends for it by and by.'Tis down to
your account; in the mean time, you will be sure to see him to-morrow
morning."cried the blacksmith; "who'll say, after
this, that there are not days set apart for happiness?How came you to
meet him, father?""I'll tell you all, by and by, about when and how we met Gabriel; for if
you expect to sleep, you are mistaken.You'll give me half your room, and
a fine chat we'll have.Spoil-sport will stay outside of this door; he is
accustomed to sleep at the children's door.""Dear me, love, I think of nothing.But, at such a moment, if you and the
young ladies wish to sup, Agricola will fetch something from the
cook-shop.""No, thank you, Dagobert, we are not hungry; we are too happy.""You will take a little wine and water, sweetened, nice and hot, to warm
you a little, my dear young ladies," said Frances; "unfortunately, I have
nothing else to offer you.""You are right, Frances; the dear children are tired, and want to go to
bed; while they do so, I'll go to my boy's room, and, before Rose and
Blanche are awake, I will come down and converse with you, just to give
Agricola a respite.""It is good Mother Bunch come to see if we want her," said Agricola."But I think she was here when my husband came in," added Frances."Right, mother; and the good girl left lest she should be an intruder:
she is so thoughtful.But no--no--it is not she who knocks so loud.""Go and see who it is, then, Agricola."Before the blacksmith could reach the door, a man decently dressed, with
a respectable air, entered the room, and glanced rapidly round, looking
for a moment at Rose and Blanche."Allow me to observe, sir," said Agricola, "that after knocking, you
might have waited till the door was opened, before you entered."Pray excuse me, sir," said the man, very politely, and speaking slowly,
perhaps to prolong his stay in the room: "I beg a thousand pardons--I
regret my intrusion--I am ashamed--"

"Well, you ought to be, sir," said Agricola, with impatience, "what do
you want?""Pray, sir, does not Miss Soliveau, a deformed needlewoman, live here?""No, sir; upstairs," said Agricola."Really, sir," cried the polite man, with low bows, "I am quite abroad at
my blunder: I thought this was the room of that young person.I brought
her proposals for work from a very respectable party.""It is very late, sir," said Agricola, with surprise."But that young
person is as one of our family.Call to-morrow; you cannot see her to
night; she is gone to bed.""Then, sir, I again beg you to excuse--"

"Enough, sir," said Agricola, taking a step towards the door."I hope, madame and the young ladies, as well as this gent, will be
assured that--"

"If you go on much longer making excuses, sir, you will have to excuse
the length of your excuses; and it is time this came to an end!"Rose and Blanche smiled at these words of Agricola; while Dagobert rubbed
his moustache with pride."But that does not
astonish you--you are used to it."During this speech, the ceremonious person withdrew, having again
directed a long inquiring glance to the sisters, and to Agricola and
Dagobert.In a few minutes after, Frances having spread a mattress on the ground
for herself, and put the whitest sheets on her bed for the orphans,
assisted them to undress with maternal solicitude, Dagobert and Agricola
having previously withdrawn to their garret.Just as the blacksmith, who
preceded his father with a light, passed before the door of Mother
Bunch's room, the latter, half concealed in the shade, said to him
rapidly, in a low tone:

"Agricola, great danger threatens you: I must speak to you."These words were uttered in so hasty and low a voice that Dagobert did
not hear them; but as Agricola stopped suddenly, with a start, the old
soldier said to him,

"Well, boy, what is it?""Nothing, father," said the blacksmith, turning round; "I feared I did
not light you well.""Oh, stand at ease about that; I have the legs and eyes of fifteen to
night;" and the soldier, not noticing his son's surprise, went into the
little room where they were both to pass the night.On leaving the house, after his inquiries about Mother Bunch, the over
polite Paul Pry slunk along to the end of Brise-Miche Street.He advanced
towards a hackney-coach drawn up on the Cloitre Saint-Merry Square.In this carriage lounged Rodin, wrapped in a cloak."The two girls and the man with gray moustache went directly to Frances
Baudoin's; by listening at the door, I learnt that the sisters will sleep
with her, in that room, to-night; the old man with gray moustache will
share the young blacksmith's room.""I did not dare insist on seeing the deformed workwoman this evening on
the subject of the Bacchanal Queen; I intend returning to-morrow, to
learn the effect of the letter she must have received this evening by the
post about the young blacksmith."And now you will call, for me, on Frances Baudoin's
confessor, late as it is; you will tell him that I am waiting for him at
Rue du Milieu des Ursins--he must not lose a moment.Should I not be returned, he will wait for me.You will tell him it
is on a matter of great moment.""All shall be faithfully executed," said the ceremonious man, cringing to
Rodin, as the coach drove quickly away.AGRICOLA AND MOTHER BUNCH.Within one hour after the different scenes which have just been described
the most profound silence reigned in the soldier's humble dwelling.A
flickering light, which played through two panes of glass in a door,
betrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep; for her gloomy
recess, without air or light, was impenetrable to the rays of day, except
by this door, opening upon a narrow and obscure passage, connected with
the roof.A sorry bed, a table, an old portmanteau, and a chair, so
nearly filled this chilling abode, that two persons could not possibly be
seated within it, unless one of them sat upon the side of the bed.The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl
was carefully stood up in a vessel of water, placed upon the table on a
linen cloth, diffusing its sweet odor around, and expanding its purple
calix in the very closet, whose plastered walls, gray and damp, were
feebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle.The sempstress, who
had taken off no part of her dress, was seated upon her bed--her looks
were downcast, and her eyes full of tears.She supported herself with one
hand resting on the bolster; and, inclining towards the door, listened
with painful eagerness, every instant hoping to hear the footsteps of
Agricola.The heart of the young sempstress beat violently; her face,
usually very pale, was now partially flushed--so exciting was the emotion
by which she was agitated.Sometimes she cast her eyes with terror upon a
letter which she held in her hand, a letter that had been delivered by
post in the course of the evening, and which had been placed by the
housekeeper (the dyer) upon the table, while she was rendering some
trivial domestic services during the recognitions of Dagobert and his
family.After some seconds, Mother Bunch heard a door, very near her own, softly
opened."I waited till my father went to sleep," said the blacksmith, in a low
voice, his physiognomy evincing much more curiosity than uneasiness."But
what is the matter, my good sister?said she, her voice trembling with emotion, while she
hastily presented to him the open letter.Agricola held it towards the
light, and read what follows:

"A person who has reasons for concealing himself, but who knows the
sisterly interest you take in the welfare of Agricola Baudoin, warns you.That young and worthy workman will probably be arrested in the course of
to-morrow."exclaimed Agricola, looking at Mother Bunch with an air of stupefied
amazement.quickly replied the sempstress, clasping her hands.Agricola resumed reading, scarcely believing the evidence of his
eyes:-"The song, entitled 'Working-men Freed,' has been declared
libellous.Numerous copies of it have been found among the papers of a
secret society, the leaders of which are about to be incarcerated, as
being concerned in the Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy."said the girl, melting into tears, "now I see it all.The man who
was lurking about below, this evening, who was observed by the dyer, was,
doubtless, a spy, lying in wait for you coming home."My verses
breathe nothing but philanthropy.Am I to blame, if they have been found
among the papers of a secret society?"Agricola disdainfully threw the
letter upon the table."If you wish it," said Agricola, "I will; no time is lost."He resumed the reading of the letter:

"A warrant is about to be issued against Agricola Baudoin.There is mo
doubt of his innocence being sooner or later made clear; but it will be
well if he screen himself for a time as much as possible from pursuit, in
order that he may escape a confinement of two or three months previous to
trial--an imprisonment which would be a terrible blow for his mother,
whose sole support he is."A SINCERE FRIEND, who is compelled to remain unknown."After a moment's silence, the blacksmith raised his head; his countenance
resumed its serenity; and laughing, he said: "Reassure yourself, good
Mother Bunch, these jokers have made a mistake by trying their games on
me.It is plainly an attempt at making an April-fool of me before the
time.""Agricola, for the love of heaven!"said the girl, in a supplicating
tone; "treat not the warning thus lightly.Believe in my forebodings, and
listen to my advice.""I tell you again, my good girl," replied Agricola, "that it is two
months since my song was published.It is not in any way political;
indeed, if it were, they would not have waited till now before coming
down on me.""But," said the other, "you forget that new events have arisen.It is
scarcely two days since the conspiracy was discovered, in this very
neighborhood, in the Rue des Prouvaires.And," continued she, "if the
verses, though perhaps hitherto unnoticed, have now been found in the
possession of the persons apprehended for this conspiracy, nothing more
is necessary to compromise you in the plot."in which I only praise the
love of labor and of goodness!If so, justice
would be but a blind noodle.That she might grope her way, it would be
necessary to furnish her with a dog and a pilgrim's staff to guide her
steps.""Agricola," resumed Mother Bunch; overwhelmed with anxiety and terror on
hearing the blacksmith jest at such a moment, "I conjure you to listen to
me!No doubt you uphold in the verses the sacred love of labor; but you
do also grievously deplore and deprecate the unjust lot of the poor
laborers, devoted as they are, without hope, to all the miseries of life;
you recommend, indeed, only fraternity among men; but your good and noble
heart vents its indignation, at the same time, against the selfish and
the wicked.In fine, you fervently hasten on, with the ardor of your
wishes, the emancipation of all the artisans who, less fortunate than
you, have not generous M. Hardy for employer.Say, Agricola, in these
times of trouble, is there anything more necessary to compromise you than
that numerous copies of your song have been found in possession of the
persons who have been apprehended?"Agricola was moved by these affectionate and judicious expressions of an
excellent creature, who reasoned from her heart; and he began to view
with more seriousness the advice which she had given him.Perceiving that she had shaken him, the sewing-girl went on to say: "And
then, bear your fellow-workman, Remi, in recollection.""Yes," resumed the sempstress; "a letter of his, a letter in itself quite
insignificant, was found in the house of a person arrested last year for
conspiracy; and Remi, in consequence, remained a month in prison.""That is true, but the injustice of his implication was easily shown, and
he was set at liberty.""Yes, Agricola: but not till he had lain a month in prison; and that has
furnished the motive of the person who advised you to conceal yourself!These words made a powerful impression upon Agricola.He took up the
letter and again read it attentively."And the man who has been lurking all this evening about the house?""I constantly recall that circumstance, which cannot be
naturally accounted for.what a blow it would be for your father,
and poor mother, who is incapable of earning anything.consider, then, what would become of them
without you--without your labor!""It would indeed be terrible," said Agricola, impatiently casting the
letter upon the table."What you have said concerning Remi is too true.He was as innocent as I am: yet an error of justice, an involuntary error
though it be, is not the less cruel.But they don't commit a man without
hearing him.""But they arrest him first, and hear him afterwards," said Mother Bunch,
bitterly; "and then, after a month or two, they restore him his liberty.And if he have a wife and children, whose only means of living is his
daily labor, what becomes of them while their only supporter is in
prison?They suffer hunger, they endure cold, and they weep!"At these simple and pathetic words, Agricola trembled."A month without work," he said, with a sad and thoughtful air."And my
mother, and father, and the two young ladies who make part of our family
until the arrival in Paris of their father, Marshal Simon.That thought, in spite of myself, affrights me!"exclaimed the girl impetuously; "suppose you apply to M.
Hardy; he is so good, and his character is so much esteemed and honored,
that, if he offered bail for you, perhaps they would give up their
persecution?""Unfortunately," replied Agricola, "M. Hardy is absent; he is on a
journey with Marshal Simon."After a silence of some time, Agricola, striving to surmount his fear,
added: "But no!After all, I had
rather await what may come.I'll at least have the chance of proving my
innocence on my first examination: for indeed, my good sister, whether it
be that I am in prison or that I fly to conceal myself, my working for my
family will be equally prevented."that is true," said the poor girl; "what is to be done!"My brave father," said Agricola to himself, "if this misfortune happen
to-morrow, what an awakening it will be for him, who came here to sleep
so joyously!"The blacksmith buried his face in his hands.Unhappily Mother Bunch's fears were too well-founded, for it will be
recollected that at that epoch of the year 1832, before and after the Rue
des Prouvaires conspiracy, a very great number of arrests had been made
among the working classes, in consequence of a violent reaction against
democratical ideas.Suddenly, the girl broke the silence which had been maintained for some
seconds.A blush  her features, which bore the impressions of an
indefinable expression of constraint, grief, and hope."The young lady, so beautiful, so good, who gave you this flower" (she
showed it to the blacksmith) "who has known how to make reparation with
so much delicacy for having made a painful offer, cannot but have a
generous heart.You must apply to her--"

With these words which seemed to be wrung from her by a violent effort
over herself, great tears rolled down her cheeks.For the first time in
her life she experienced a feeling of grievous jealousy.Another woman
was so happy as to have the power of coming to the relief of him whom she
idolized; while she herself, poor creature, was powerless and wretched."But what could be done
with this young lady?""Did she not say to you," answered Mother Bunch, "'Remember my name; and
in all circumstances address yourself to me?'""This young lady, in her exalted position, ought to have powerful
connections who will be able to protect and defend you.Go to her to
morrow morning; tell her frankly what has happened, and request her
support.""But tell me, my good sister, what it is you wish me to do?"I remember that, in former times, my father told us that he had
saved one of his friends from being put in prison, by becoming surety for
him.It will be easy for you so to convince this young lady of your
innocence, that she will be induced to become surety; and after that, you
will have nothing more to fear."said Agricola, "to ask so great a service from a person
to whom one is almost unknown is hard.""Believe me, Agricola," said the other sadly, "I would never counsel what
could possibly lower you in the eyes of any one, and above all--do you
understand?--above all, in the eyes of this young lady.I do not propose
that you should ask money from her; but only that she should give surety
for you, in order that you may have the liberty of continuing at your
employment, so that the family may not be without resources.Believe me,
Agricola, that such a request is in no respect inconsistent with what is
noble and becoming upon your part.The heart of the young lady is
generous.The required surety will be
as nothing to her; while to you it will be everything, and will even be
the very life to those who depend upon you.""You are right, my good sister," said Agricola, with sadness and
dejection."It is perhaps worth while to risk taking this step.If the
young lady consent to render me this service, and if giving surety will
indeed preserve me from prison, I shall be prepared for every event.added he, rising, "I'd never dare to make the request to her!What is the insignificant service that I
rendered her, when compared with that which I should solicit from her?""Do you imagine then, Agricola, that a generous spirit measures the
services which ought to be rendered, by those previously received?Trust
to me respecting a matter which is an affair of the heart.I am, it is
true, but a lowly creature, and ought not to compare myself with any
other person.I am nothing, and I can do nothing.Nevertheless, I am
sure--yes, Agricola, I am sure--that this young lady, who is so very far
above me, will experience the same feelings that I do in this affair;
yes, like me, she will at once comprehend that your position is a cruel
one; and she will do with joy, with happiness, with thankfulness, that
which I would do, if, alas!I could do anything more than uselessly
consume myself with regrets."In spite of herself, she pronounced the last words with an expression so
heart-breaking--there was something so moving in the comparison which
this unfortunate creature, obscure and disdained, infirm and miserable,
made of herself with Adrienne de Cardoville, the very type of resplendent
youth, beauty, and opulence--that Agricola was moved even to tears; and,
holding out one of his hands to the speaker, he said to her, tenderly,
"How very good you are; how full of nobleness, good feeling, and
delicacy!""Unhappily," said the weeping girl, "I can do nothing more than advise.""And your counsels shall be followed out, my sister dear.They are those
of a soul the most elevated I have ever known.Yes, you have won me over
into making this experiment, by persuading me that the heart of Miss de
Cardoville is perhaps equal in value to your own!"At this charming and sincere assimilation of herself to Miss Adrienne,
the sempstress forgot almost everything she had suffered, so exquisitely
sweet and consoling were her emotions.If some poor creatures, fatally
devoted to sufferings, experience griefs of which the world knows naught,
they sometimes, too, are cheered by humble and timid joys, of which the
world is equally ignorant.The least word of true tenderness and
affection, which elevates them in their own estimation, is ineffably
blissful for these unfortunate beings, habitually consigned, not only to
hardships and to disdain, but even to desolating doubts, and distrust of
themselves."Then it is agreed that you will go, to-morrow morning to this young
lady's house?"exclaimed Mother Bunch, trembling with a new-born hope."And," she quickly added, "at break of day I'll go down to watch at the
street-door, to see if there be anything suspicious, and to apprise you
of what I perceive.""It will be necessary to endeavor to set off before the wakening of your
father," said the hunchback."The quarter in which the young lady dwells,
is so deserted, that the mere going there will almost serve for your
present concealment.""I think I hear the voice of my father," said Agricola suddenly.In truth, the little apartment was so near Agricola's garret, that he and
the sempstress, listening, heard Dagobert say in the dark:

"Agricola, is it thus that you sleep, my boy?Why, my first sleep is
over; and my tongue itches deucedly."said Mother Bunch; "your absence would disquiet
him.On no account go out to-morrow morning, before I inform you whether
or not I shall have seen anything suspicious.""Why, Agricola, you are not here?"resumed Dagobert, in a louder voice."Here I am, father," said the smith, while going out of the sempstress's
apartment, and entering the garret, to his father."I have been to fasten the shutter of a loft that the wind agitated, lest
its noise should disturb you.""Thanks, my boy; but it is not noise that wakes me," said Dagobert,
gayly; "it is an appetite, quite furious, for a chat with you.Oh, my
dear boy, it is the hungering of a proud old man of a father, who has not
seen his son for eighteen years.""Shall I light a candle, father?""No, no; that would be luxurious; let us chat in the dark.It will be a
new pleasure for me to see you to-morrow morning at daybreak.It will be
like seeing you for the first time twice."The door of Agricola's garret
being now closed, Mother Bunch heard nothing more.The poor girl, without undressing, threw herself upon the bed, and closed
not an eye during the night, painfully awaiting the appearance of day, in
order that she might watch over the safety of Agricola.However, in spite
of her vivid anxieties for the morrow, she sometimes allowed herself to
sink into the reveries of a bitter melancholy.She compared the
conversation she had just had in the silence of night, with the man whom
she secretly adored, with what that conversation might have been, had she
possessed some share of charms and beauty--had she been loved as she
loved, with a chaste and devoted flame!But soon sinking into belief that
she should never know the ravishing sweets of a mutual passion, she found
consolation in the hope of being useful to Agricola.At the dawn of day,
she rose softly, and descended the staircase with little noise, in order
to see if anything menaced Agricola from without.The weather, damp and foggy during a portion of the night, became clear
and cold towards morning.Through the glazed skylight of Agricola's
garret, where he lay with his father, a corner of the blue sky could be
seen.The apartment of the young blacksmith had an aspect as poor as the
sewing-girl's.For its sole ornament, over the deal table upon which
Agricola wrote his poetical inspirations, there hung suspended from a
nail in the wall a portrait of Beranger--that immortal poet whom the
people revere and cherish, because his rare and transcendent genius has
delighted to enlighten the people, and to sing their glories and their
reverses.Although the day had only begun to dawn, Dagobert and Agricola had
already risen.The latter had sufficient self command to conceal his
inquietude, for renewed reflection had again increased his fears.The recent outbreak in the Rue des Prouvaires had caused a great number
of precautionary arrests; and the discovery of numerous copies of
Agricola's song, in the possession of one of the chiefs of the
disconcerted plot, was, in truth, calculated slightly to compromise the
young blacksmith.His father, however, as we have already mentioned,
suspected not his secret anguish.Seated by the side of his son, upon the
edge of their mean little bed, the old soldier, by break of day, had
dressed and shaved with military care; he now held between his hands both
those of Agricola, his countenance radiant with joy, and unable to
discontinue the contemplation of his boy."You will laugh at me, my dear boy," said Dagobert to his son; "but I
wished the night to the devil, in order that I might gaze upon you in
full day, as I now see you.But all in good time; I have lost nothing.Here is another silliness of mine; it delights me to see you wear
moustaches.What a splendid horse-grenadier you would have made!Tell me;
have you never had a wish to be a soldier?""That's right," said Dagobert: "and besides, I believe, after all, look
ye, that the time of the sword has gone by.We old fellows are now good
for nothing, but to be put in a corner of the chimney.Like rusty old
carbines, we have had our day.""Yes; your days of heroism and of glory," said Agricola with excitement;
and then he added, with a voice profoundly softened and agitated, "it is
something good and cheering to be your son!""As to the good, I know nothing of that," replied Dagobert; "but as for
the cheering, it ought to be so; for I love you proudly.And I think this
is but the beginning!I am like the famished
wretches who have been some days without food.It is but by little and
little that they recover themselves, and can eat.Now, you may expect to
be tasted, my boy, morning and evening, and devoured during the day.No,
I wish not to think that--not all the day--no, that thought dazzles and
perplexes me; and I am no longer myself."These words of Dagobert caused a painful feeling to Agricola.He believed
that they sprang from a presentiment of the separation with which he was
menaced."Well," continued Dagobert; "you are quite happy; M. Hardy is always good
to you."replied Agricola: "there is none in the world better, or more
equitable and generous!If you knew what wonders he has brought about in
his factory!Compared to all others, it is a paradise beside the stithies
of Lucifer!""You shall see," resumed Agricola, "what welfare, what joy, what
affection, are displayed upon the countenances of all whom he employs;
who work with an ardent pleasure."This M. Hardy of yours must be an out-and-out magician," said Dagobert."He is, father, a very great magician.He has known how to render labor
pleasant and attractive.As for the pleasure, over and above good wages,
he accords to us a portion of his profits according to our deserts;
whence you may judge of the eagerness with which we go to work.And that
is not all: he has caused large, handsome buildings to be erected, in
which all his workpeople find, at less expense than elsewhere, cheerful
and salubrious lodgings, in which they enjoy all the advantages of an
association.But you shall see--I repeat--you shall see!""They have good reason to say, that Paris is the region of wonders,"
observed Dagobert."Well, behold me here again at last, never more to quit you, nor good
mother!""No, father, we will never separate again," said Agricola, stifling a
sigh."My mother and I will both try to make you forget all that you have
suffered."exclaimed Dagobert, "who the deuce has suffered?Look me well
in the face; and see if I have a look of suffering!Since I have put my foot here, I feel myself quite a young man again!You
shall see me march soon: I bet that I tire you out!I wager that in
beholding your black moustache and my gray one, folks will say, behold
father and son!But let us settle what we are to do with the day.You
will write to the father of Marshal Simon, informing him the his
grand-daughters have arrived, and that it is necessary that he should
hasten his return to Paris; for he has charged himself with matters which
are of great importance for them.While you are writing, I will go down
to say good-morning to my wife, and to the dear little ones.Your mother will go to mass; for I perceive that she likes
to be regular at that: the good soul!and
during her absence, we will make a raid together.""Father," said Agricola, with embarrassment, "this morning it is out of
my power to accompany you."said Dagobert; "recollect this is Monday!""Yes, father," said Agricola, hesitatingly; "but I have promised to
attend all the morning in the workshop, to finish a job that is required
in a hurry.If I fail to do so, I shall inflict some injury upon M.
Hardy."That alters the case," said Dagobert, with a sigh of regret."I thought
to make my first parade through Paris with you this morning; but it must
be deferred in favor of your work.It is sacred: since it is that which
sustains your mother.Nevertheless, it is vexatious, devilish vexatious.See how quickly one gets habituated to and
spoilt by happiness.I growl like a true grumbler, at a walk being put
off for a few hours!I who, during eighteen years, have only
hoped to see you once more, without daring to reckon very much upon it!Vive l'amour et cogni--I mean--my
Agricola!"And, to console himself, the old soldier gayly slapped his
son's shoulder.This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith; for he dreaded one
moment to another lest the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized."Now
that I have recovered myself," said Dagobert, laughing, "let us speak of
business.Know you where I find the addresses of all the notaries in
Paris?""I don't know; but nothing is more easy than to discover it.""My reason is," resumed Dagobert, "that I sent from Russia by post, and
by order of the mother of the two children that I have brought here, some
important papers to a Parisian notary.As it was my duty to see this
notary immediately upon my arrival, I had written his name and his
address in a portfolio, of which however, I have been robbed during my
journey; and as I have forgotten his devil of a name, it seems to me,
that if I should see it again in the list of notaries, I might recollect
it."Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start.He
involuntarily thought of a warrant for his apprehension.His father, who, at the sound of the knocking turned round his head, had
not perceived his emotion, and said with a loud voice: "Come in!"He wore a black cassock and a broad brimmed
hat.To recognize his brother by adoption, and to throw himself into his arms,
were two movements performed at once by Agricola--as quick as
thought.--"My brother!"Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary,
while they were locked in a close embrace.Dagobert, moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments, felt his eyes
become moist.There was something truly touching in the affection of the
young men--in their hearts so much alike, and yet of characters and
aspects so very different--for the manly countenance of Agricola
contrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of Gabriel."I was forewarned by my father of your arrival," said the blacksmith at
length."I have been expecting to see you; and my happiness has been a
hundred times the greater, because I have had all the pleasures of hoping
for it."asked Gabriel, in affectionately grasping the hands
of Dagobert."I trust that you have found her in good health."replied Dagobert; "and her health will have become a
hundred times better, now that we are all together.Then addressing himself to Agricola, who, forgetting
his fear of being arrested, regarded the missionary with an expression of
ineffable affection, Dagobert added:

"Let it be remembered, that, with the soft cheek of a young girl, Gabriel
has the courage of a lion; I have already told with what intrepidity he
saved the lives of Marshal Simon's daughters, and tried to save mine
also."suddenly exclaimed
Agricola, who for a few seconds had been attentively examining the
missionary.Gabriel, having thrown aside his hat on entering, was now directly
beneath the skylight of the garret apartment, the bright light through
which shone upon his sweet, pale countenance: and the round scar, which
extended from one eyebrow to the other, was therefore distinctly visible.In the midst of the powerful and diversified emotion, and of the exciting
events which so rapidly followed the shipwreck on the rocky coast near
Cardoville House, Dagobert, during the short interview he then had with
Gabriel, had not perceived the scar which seamed the forehead of the
young missionary.Now, partaking, however, of the surprise of his son,
Dagobert said:

"Aye, indeed!"And on his hands, too; see, dear father!"exclaimed the blacksmith, with
renewed surprise, while he seized one of the hands which the young priest
held out towards him in order to tranquillize his fears."Gabriel, my brave boy, explain this to us!"added Dagobert; "who has
wounded you thus?"and in his turn, taking the other hand of the
missionary, he examined the scar upon it with the eye of a judge of
wounds, and then added, "In Spain, one of my comrades was found and taken
down alive from a cross, erected at the junction of several roads, upon
which the monks had crucified, and left him to die of hunger, thirst, and
agony.Ever afterwards he bore scars upon his hands, exactly similar to
this upon your hand.""It is evident that your hands
have been pierced through!and Agricola became
grievously agitated."Do not think about it," said Gabriel, reddening with the embarrassment
of modesty."Having gone as a missionary amongst the savages of the Rocky
Mountains, they crucified me, and they had begun to scalp me, when
Providence snatched me from their hands.""Unfortunate youth," said Dagobert; "without arms then?You had not a
sufficient escort for your protection?""It is not for such as me to carry arms."said Gabriel, sweetly smiling;
"and we are never accompanied by any escort.""Well, but your companions, those who were along with you, how came it
that they did not defend you?""Yes, alone; without even a guide."exclaimed Dagobert,
scarcely crediting a step so unmilitary, and almost distrusting his own
sense of hearing."The Christian faith," said Gabriel, with mild simplicity, "cannot be
implanted by force or violence.It is only by the power of persuasion
that the gospel can be spread amongst poor savages.""Why, then, dear brother, one has but to die for the belief that is in
him, pitying those who have rejected it, and who have refused the
blessings it offers to mankind."There was a period of profound silence after the reply of Gabriel, which
was uttered with simple and touching pathos.Dagobert was in his own nature too courageous not to comprehend a heroism
thus calm and resigned; and the old soldier, as well as his son, now
contemplated Gabriel with the most earnest feelings of mingled admiration
and respect.Gabriel, entirely free from the affection of false modesty, seemed quite
unconscious of the emotions which he had excited in the breasts of his
two friends; and he therefore said to Dagobert, "What ails you?"exclaimed the brave old soldier, with great emotion:
"After having been for thirty years in the wars, I had imagined myself to
be about as courageous as any man."Thunder, don't you know that the brave wounds there" (the veteran took
with transport both of Gabriel's hands), "that these wounds are as
glorious--are more glorious than our--than all ours, as warriors by
profession!"exclaimed Agricola; and he added,
with enthusiasm, "Oh, for such priests!How I am elevated by their charity, their courage, their
resignation!""I entreat you not to extol me thus," said Gabriel with embarrassment.When I have
gone into the heat of action, did I rush into it alone?Was I not under
the eyes of my commanding officer?Were not my comrades there along with
me?In default of true courage, had I not the instinct of self
preservation to spur me on, without reckoning the excitement of the
shouts and tumult of battle, the smell of the gunpowder, the flourishes
of the trumpets, the thundering of the cannon, the ardor of my horse,
which bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail?Need I state
that I also knew that the emperor was present, with his eye upon every
one--the emperor, who, in recompense for a hole being made in my tough
hide, would give me a bit of lace or a ribbon, as plaster for the wound.Thanks to all these causes, I passed for game.But are you
not a thousand times more game than I, my brave boy; going alone,
unarmed, to confront enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those
whom we attacked--we, who fought in whole squadrons, supported by
artillery, bomb-shells, and case-shot?"cried Agricola, "how noble of you to render to
Gabriel this justice!""Oh, dear brother," said Gabriel, "his kindness to me makes him magnify
what was quite natural and simple!"said the veteran soldier; "yes, natural for gallants who have
hearts of the true temper: but that temper is rare.""Oh, yes, very rare," said Agricola; "for that kind of courage is the
most admirable of all.Most bravely did you seek almost certain death,
alone, bearing the cross in hand as your only weapon, to preach charity
and Christian brotherhood.They seized you, tortured you; and you await
death and partly endure it, without complaint, without remonstrance,
without hatred, without anger, without a wish for vengeance; forgiveness
issuing from your mouth, and a smile of pity beaming upon your lips; and
this in the depths of forests, where no one could witness your
magnanimity,--none could behold you--and without other desire, after you
were rescued than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your black
robe!can you still contend that you are not
as brave as he?""And besides, too," resumed Dagobert, "the dear boy did all that for a
thankless paymaster; for it is true, Agricola, that his wounds will never
change his humble black robe of a priest into the rich robe of a bishop!""I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be," said Gabriel to
Dagobert, smiling meekly."If I am deemed worthy, a great recompense
awaits me on high.""As to all that, my boy," said Dagobert, "I do not understand it; and I
will not argue about it.I maintain it, that my old cross of honor would
be at least as deservedly affixed to your cassock as upon my uniform.""But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like
Gabriel," said Agricola, "and if you did know, dear father, how much
virtue and valor is among those whom the highest orders in the priesthood
insolently call the inferior clergy,--the unseen merit and the blind
devotedness to be found amongst worthy, but obscure, country curates, who
are inhumanly treated and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by the lordly
lawnsleeves!Like us, those poor priests are worthy laborers in their
vocation; and for them, also, all generous hearts ought to demand
enfranchisement!Sons of common people, like ourselves, and useful as we
are, justice ought to be rendered both to them and to us.You will not contradict it; for you have told me, that your
ambition would have been to obtain a small country curacy; because you
understand the good that you could work within it.""My desire is still the same," said Gabriel sadly: "but unfortunately--"
and then, as if he wished to escape from a painful thought, and to change
the conversation, he, addressing himself to Dagobert, added: "Believe me:
be more just than to undervalue your own courage by exalting mine.Your
courage must be very great--very great; for, after a battle, the
spectacle of the carnage must be truly terrible to a generous and feeling
heart.We, at least, though we may be killed, do not kill."At these words of the missionary, the soldier drew himself up erect,
looked upon Gabriel with astonishment, and said, "This is most
surprising!""What Gabriel has just told us," replied Dagobert, "brings to my mind
what I experienced in warfare on the battlefield in proportion as I
advanced in years.Listen, my children: more than once, on the night
after a general engagement, I have been mounted as a vidette,--alone,--by
night,--amid the moonlight, on the field of battle which remained in our
possession, and upon which lay the bodies of seven or eight thousand of
the slain, amongst whom were mingled the slaughtered remains of some of
my old comrades: and then this sad scene, when the profound silence has
restored me to my senses from the thirst for bloodshed and the delirious
whirling of my sword (intoxicated like the rest), I have said to myself,
'for what have these men been killed?--FOR WHAT--FOR WHAT?'But this
feeling, well understood as it was, hindered me not, on the following
morning, when the trumpets again sounded the charge, from rushing once
more to the slaughter.But the same thought always recurred when my arm
became weary with carnage; and after wiping my sabre upon the mane of my
horse, I have said to myself, 'I have killed!--killed!!--killed!!!The missionary and the blacksmith exchanged looks on hearing the old
soldier give utterance to this singular retrospection of the past.said Gabriel to him, "all generous hearts feel as you did during
the solemn moments, when the intoxication of glory has subsided, and man
is left alone to the influence of the good instincts planted in his
bosom.""And that should prove, my brave boy," rejoined Dagobert, "that you are
greatly better than I; for those noble instincts, as you call them, have
never abandoned you.* * * * But how the deuce did you escape from the
claws of the infuriated savages who had already crucified you?"At this question of Dagobert, Gabriel started and reddened so visibly,
that the soldier said to him: "If you ought not or cannot answer my
request, let us say no more about it.""I have nothing to conceal, either from you or from my brother," replied
the missionary with altered voice."Only; it will be difficult for me to
make you comprehend what I cannot comprehend myself.""Surely," said Gabriel, reddening more deeply, "I must have been deceived
by a fallacy of my senses, during that abstracted moment in which I
awaited death with resignation.My enfeebled mind, in spite of me, must
have been cheated by an illusion; or that, which to the present hour has
remained inexplicable, would have been more slowly developed; and I
should have known with greater certainty that it was the strange woman--"

Dagobert, while listening to the missionary, was perfectly amazed; for he
also had vainly tried to account for the unexpected succor which had
freed him and the two orphans from the prison at Leipsic."Of her who saved me," was the reply."A woman saved you from the hands of the savages?""Yes," replied Gabriel, though absorbed in his reflections, "a woman,
young and beautiful!"When I asked her, she replied, 'I am the sister of the
distressed!'"asked Dagobert, singularly
interested."'I go wheresoever there is suffering,' she replied," answered
the missionary; "and she departed, going towards the north of
America--towards those desolate regions in which there is eternal snow,
where the nights are without end.""As in Siberia," said Dagobert, who had become very thoughtful."But," resumed Agricola, addressing himself to Gabriel, who seemed also
to have become more and more absorbed, "in what manner or by what means
did this woman come to your assistance?"The missionary was about to reply to the last question, when there was
heard a gentle tap at the door of the garret apartment, which renewed the
fears that Agricola had forgotten since the arrival of his adopted
brother."Agricola," said a sweet voice outside the door, "I wish to
speak with you as soon as possible."The blacksmith recognized Mother Bunch's voice, and opened the door.But
the young sempstress, instead of entering, drew back into the dark
passage, and said, with a voice of anxiety: "Agricola, it is an hour
since broad day, and you have not yet departed!I have
been watching below, in the street, until now, and have seen nothing
alarming; but they may come any instant to arrest you.Hasten, I conjure
you, your departure for the abode of Miss de Cardoville."Had it not been for the arrival of Gabriel, I should have been gone.But
I could not resist the happiness of remaining some little time with him."said Mother Bunch, with sweet surprise; for, as has been
stated, she had been brought up with him and Agricola."Yes," answered Agricola, "for half an hour he has been with my father
and me.""What happiness I shall have in seeing him again," said the sewing-girl."He doubtless came upstairs while I had gone for a brief space to your
mother, to ask if I could be useful in any way on account of the young
ladies; but they have been so fatigued that they still sleep.Your mother
has requested me to give you this letter for your father."Well," resumed Mother Bunch, "now that you have seen Gabriel, do not
delay long.Think what a blow it would be for your father, if they came
to arrest you in his very presence mon Dieu!""You are right," said Agricola; "it is indispensable that I should
depart--while near Gabriel in spite of my anxiety, my fears were
forgotten.""Go quickly, then; and if Miss de Cardoville should grant this favor,
perhaps in a couple of hours you will return, quite at ease both as to
yourself and us."a very few minutes more; and I'll come down."I'll come up
again to apprise you.Mother Bunch hurriedly descended the staircase,
to resume her watch at the street door, and Agricola re-entered his
garret."Dear father," he said to Dagobert, "my mother has just received
this letter, and she requests you to read it.""Very well; read it for me, my boy."And Agricola read as follows:

"MADAME.--I understand that your husband has been charged by General Simon
with an affair of very great importance.Will you, as soon as your
husband arrives in Paris, request him to come to my office at Chartres
without a moment's delay.I am instructed to deliver to himself, and to
no other person, some documents indispensable to the interests of General
Simon."DURAND, Notary at Chartres."Dagobert looked at his son with astonishment, and said to him, "Who can
have told this gentleman already of my arrival in Paris?""Perhaps, father," said Agricola, "this is the notary to whom you
transmitted some papers, and whose address you have lost.""But his name was not Durand; and I distinctly recollect that his address
was Paris, not Chartres.And, besides," said the soldier, thoughtfully,
"if he has some important documents, why didn't he transmit them to me?""It seems to me that you ought not to neglect going to him as soon as
possible," said Agricola, secretly rejoiced that this circumstance would
withdraw his father for about two days, during which time his
(Agricola's) fate would be decided in one way or other."Your counsel is good," replied his father."This thwarts your intentions in some degree?""Rather, my lads; for I counted upon passing the day with you.Having come happily from Siberia to Paris, it
is not for me to fear a journey from Paris to Chartres, when it is
required on an affair of importance.In twice twenty-four hours I shall
be back again.But the deuce take me if I expected to leave Paris for
Chartres to-day.Luckily, I leave Rose and Blanche with my good wife; and
Gabriel, their angel, as they call him, will be here to keep them
company.""That is, unfortunately, impossible," said the missionary, sadly."This
visit on my arrival is also a farewell visit."exclaimed Dagobert and Agricola both at once.said Dagobert; "surely it is not
possible?""I must answer no question upon this subject," said Gabriel, suppressing
a sigh: "but from now, for some time, I cannot, and ought not, come again
into this house.""Why, my brave boy," resumed Dagobert with emotion, "there is something
in thy conduct that savors of constraint, of oppression.He you call superior, whom I saw for some moments after the
shipwreck at Cardoville Castle, has a bad look; and I am sorry to see you
enrolled under such a commander."exclaimed Agricola, struck with the identity of
the name with that of the young lady of the golden hair; "was it in
Cardoville Castle that you were received after your shipwreck?""Yes, my boy; why, does that astonish you?""Nothing father; but were the owners of the castle there at the time?""No; for the steward, when I applied to him for an opportunity to return
thanks for the kind hospitality we had experienced, informed me that the
person to whom the house belonged was resident at Paris.""What a singular coincidence," thought Agricola, "if the young lady
should be the proprietor of the dwelling which bears her name!"This reflection having recalled to Agricola the promise which he had made
to Mother Bunch, he said to Dagobert; "Dear father, excuse me; but it is
already late, and I ought to be in the workshop by eight o'clock."This party is adjourned till my
return from Chartres.Embrace me once more, and take care of yourself."Since Dagobert had spoken of constraint and oppression to Gabriel, the
latter had continued pensive.At the moment when Agricola approached him
to shake hands, and to bid him adieu, the missionary said to him
solemnly, with a grave voice, and in a tone of decision that astonished
both the blacksmith and the soldier: "My dear brother, one word more.I
have come here to say to you also that within a few days hence I shall
have need of you; and of you also, my father (permit me so to call you),"
added Gabriel, with emotion, as he turned round to Dagobert.exclaimed Agricola; "what is the matter?""Yes," replied Gabriel, "I need the advice and assistance of two men of
honor--of two men of resolution;--and I can reckon upon you two--can I
not?At any hour, on whatever day it may be, upon a word from me, will
you come?"Dagobert and his son regarded each other in silence, astonished at the
accents of the missionary.Agricola felt an oppression of the heart.If
he should be a prisoner when his brother should require his assistance,
what could be done?"At every hour, by night or by day, my brave boy, you may depend upon
us," said Dagobert, as much surprised as interested--"You have a father
and a brother; make your own use of them.""Thanks, thanks," said Gabriel, "you set me quite at ease.""I'll tell you what," resumed the soldier, "were it not for your priest's
robe, I should believe, from the manner in which you have spoken to us,
that you are about to be engaged in a duel--in a mortal combat.""Yes; it may be a duel--uncommon and
fearful--at which it is necessary to have two witnesses such as you--A
FATHER and A BROTHER!"Some instants afterwards, Agricola, whose anxiety was continually
increasing, set off in haste for the dwelling of Mademoiselle de
Cardoville, to which we now beg leave to take the reader.Dizier House was one of the largest and handsomest in the Rue Babylone,
in Paris.Nothing could be more severe, more imposing, or more depressing
than the aspect of this old mansion.Several immense windows, filled with
small squares of glass, painted a grayish white, increased the sombre
effect of the massive layers of huge stones, blackened by time, of which
the fabric was composed.This dwelling bore a resemblance to all the others that had been erected
in the same quarter towards the middle of the last century.It was
surmounted in front by a pediment; it had an elevated ground floor, which
was reached from the outside by a circular flight of broad stone steps.One of the fronts looked on an immense court-yard, on each side of which
an arcade led to the vast interior departments.The other front
overlooked the garden, or rather park, of twelve or fifteen roods; and,
on this side, wings, approaching the principal part of the structure,
formed a couple of lateral galleries.Like nearly all the other great
habitations of this quarter, there might be seen at the extremity of the
garden, what the owners and occupiers of each called the lesser mansion.This extension was a Pompadour summer-house, built in the form of a
rotunda, with the charming though incorrect taste of the era of its
erection.It presented, in every part where it was possible for the
stones to be cut, a profusion of endives, knots of ribbons, garlands of
flowers, and chubby cupids.This pavilion, inhabited by Adrienne de
Cardoville was composed of a ground floor, which was reached by a
peristyle of several steps.A small vestibule led to a circular hall,
lighted from the roof.Four principal apartments met here; and ranges of
smaller rooms, concealed in the upper story, served for minor purposes.These dependencies of great habitations are in our days disused, or
transformed into irregular conservatories; but by an uncommon exception,
the black exterior of the pavilion had been scraped and renewed, and the
entire structure repaired.The white stones of which it was built
glistened like Parian marble; and its renovated, coquettish aspect
contrasted singularly with the gloomy mansion seen at the other extremity
of an extensive lawn, on which were planted here and there gigantic
clumps of verdant trees.The following scene occurred at this residence on the morning following
that of the arrival of Dagobert, with the daughters of Marshal Simon, in
the Rue Brise-Miche.The hour of eight had sounded from the steeple of a
neighboring church; a brilliant winter sun arose to brighten a pure blue
sky behind the tall leafless trees, which in summer formed a dome of
verdure over the summer-house.The door in the vestibule opened, and the
rays of the morning sun beamed upon a charming creature, or rather upon
two charming creatures, for the second one, though filling a modest place
in the scale of creation, was not less distinguished by beauty of its
own, which was very striking.In plain terms two individuals, one of them
a young girl, and the other a tiny English dog, of great beauty, of that
breed of spaniels called King Charles's, made their appearance under the
peristyle of the rotunda.The name of the young girl was Georgette; the
beautiful little spaniel's was Frisky.Georgette was in her eighteenth
year.Never had Florine or Manton, never had a lady's maid of Marivaux, a
more mischievous face, an eye more quick, a smile more roguish, teeth
more white, cheeks more roseate, figure more coquettish, feet smaller, or
form smarter, attractive, and enticing.Though it was yet very early,
Georgette was carefully and tastefully dressed.A tiny Valenciennes cap,
with flaps and flap-band, of half peasant fashion, decked with
rose- ribbons, and stuck a little backward upon bands of beautiful
fair hair, surrounded her fresh and piquant face; a robe of gray
levantine, and a cambric neck-kerchief, fastened to her bosom by a large
tuft of rose- ribbons, displayed her figure elegantly rounded; a
hollands apron, white as snow, trimmed below by three large hems,
surmounted by a Vandyke-row, encircled her waist, which was as round and
flexible as a reed; her short, plain sleeves, edged with bone lace,
allowed her plump arms to be seen, which her long Swedish gloves,
reaching to the elbow, defended from the rigor of the cold.When
Georgette raised the bottom of her dress, in order to descend more
quickly the steps, she exhibited to Frisky's indifferent eyes a beautiful
ankle, and the beginning of the plump calf of a fine leg, encased in
white silk, and a charming little foot, in a laced half-boot of Turkish
satin.When a blonde like Georgette sets herself to be ensnaring; when
vivid glances sparkle from her eyes of bright yet tender blue; when a
joyous excitement suffuses her transparent skin, she is more resistless
for the conquest of everything before her than a brunette.This bewitching and nimble lady's-maid, who on the previous evening had
introduced Agricola to the pavilion, was first waiting woman to the
Honorable Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, niece of the Princess Saint
Dizier.Frisky, so happily found and brought back by the blacksmith, uttered weak
but joyful barks, and bounded, ran, and frolicked upon the turf.She was
not much bigger than one's fist; her curled hair, of lustrous black,
shone like ebony, under the broad, red satin ribbon which encircled her
neck; her paws, fringed with long silken fur, were of a bright and fiery
tan, as well as her muzzle, the nose of which was inconceivably pug; her
large eyes were full of intelligence; and her curly ears so long that
they trailed upon the ground.Georgette seemed to be as brisk and
petulant as Frisky, and shared her sportiveness,--now scampering after
the happy little spaniel, and now retreating, in order to be pursued upon
the greensward in her turn.All at once, at the sight of a second person,
who advanced with deliberate gravity, Georgette and Frisky were suddenly
stopped in their diversion.The little King Charles, some steps in
advance of Georgette, faithful to her name, and bold as the devil, held
herself firmly upon her nervous paws, and fiercely awaited the coming up
of the enemy, displaying at the same time rows of little teeth, which,
though of ivory, were none the less pointed and sharp.The enemy
consisted of a woman of mature age, accompanied by a very fat dog, of the
color of coffee and milk; his tail was twisted like a corkscrew; he was
pot-bellied; his skin was sleek; his neck was turned little to one side;
he walked with his legs inordinately spread out, and stepped with the air
of a doctor.His black muzzle, quarrelsome and scowling showed two fangs
sallying forth, and turning up from the left side of the mouth, and
altogether he had an expression singularly forbidding and vindictive.This disagreeable animal, a perfect type of what might be called a
"church-goer's pug," answered to the name of "My Lord."His mistress, a
woman of about fifty years of age, corpulent and of middle size, was
dressed in a costume as gloomy and severe as that of Georgette was gay
and showy.It consisted of a brown robe, a black silk mantle, and a hat
of the same dye.The features of this woman might have been agreeable in
her youth; and her florid cheeks, her correct eyebrows, her black eyes,
which were still very lively, scarcely accorded with the peevish and
austere physiognomy which she tried to assume.This matron, of slow and
discreet gait, was Madame Augustine Grivois, first woman to the Princess
Saint-Dizier.Not only did the age, the face, and the dress of these two
women present a striking contrast; but the contrast extended itself even
to the animals which attended them.There were similar differences
between Frisky and My Lord, as between Georgette and Mrs.When
the latter perceived the little King Charles, she could not restrain a
movement of surprise and repugnance, which escaped not the notice of the
young lady's maid.Frisky, who had not retreated one inch, since the
apparition of My Lord, regarded him valiantly, with a look of defiance,
and even advanced towards him with an air so decidedly hostile, that the
cur, though thrice as big as the little King Charles, uttered a howl of
distress and terror, and sought refuge behind Mrs.Grivois, who bitterly
said to Georgette:

"It seems to me, miss, that you might dispense with exciting your dog
thus, and setting him upon mine.""It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but ugly
animal from similar alarms, that you tried to make us lose Frisky
yesterday, by driving her into the street through the little garden gate.But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de Babylone,
and brought her back to my mistress.However," continued Georgette, "to
what, madame, do I owe the pleasure of seeing you this morning?""I am commanded by the Princess," replied Mrs.Grivois, unable to conceal
a smile of triumphant satisfaction, "immediately to see Miss Adrienne.It
regards a very important affair, which I am to communicate only to
herself."At these words Georgette became purple, and could not repress a slight
start of disquietude, which happily escaped Grivois, who was occupied
with watching over the safety of her pet, whom Frisky continued to snarl
at with a very menacing aspect; and Georgette, having quickly overcome
her temporary emotion, firmly answered: "Miss Adrienne went to rest very
late last night.She has forbidden me to enter her apartment before mid
day.""That is very possible: but as the present business is to obey an order
of the Princess her aunt, you will do well if you please, miss, to awaken
your mistress immediately.""My mistress is subject to no one's orders in her own house; and I will
not disturb her till mid-day, in pursuance of her commands," replied
Georgette."Then I shall go myself," said Mrs."Florine and Hebe will not admit you.Indeed, here is the key of the
saloon; and through the saloon only can the apartments of Miss Adrienne
be entered."do you dare refuse me permission to execute the orders of the
Princess?""Yes; I dare to commit the great crime of being unwilling to awaken my
mistress!"such are the results of the blind affection of the Princess for her
niece," said the matron, with affected grief: "Miss Adrienne no longer
respects her aunt's orders; and she is surrounded by young hare-brained
persons, who, from the first dawn of morning, dress themselves out as if
for ball-going."how came you to revile dress, who were formerly the greatest
coquette and the most frisky and fluttering of all the Princess's women.At least, that is what is still spoken of you in the hotel, as having
been handed down from time out of mind, by generation to generation, even
unto ours!"do you mean to insinuate that I am a
hundred years old, Miss Impertinence?""I speak of the generations of waiting-women; for, except you, it is the
utmost if they remain two or three years in the Princess's house, who has
too many tempers for the poor girls!""I forbid you to speak thus of my mistress, whose name some people ought
not to pronounce but on their knees.""However," said Georgette, "if one wished to speak ill of--"

"Do you dare!""No longer ago than last night, at half past eleven o'clock--"

"Last night?""A four-wheeler," continued Georgette, "stopped at a few paces from the
house.A mysterious personage, wrapped up in a cloak, alighted from it,
and directly tapped, not at the door, but on the glass of the porter's
lodge window; and at one o'clock in the morning, the cab was still
stationed in the street, waiting for the mysterious personage in the
cloak, who, doubtless, during all that time, was, as you say, pronouncing
the name of her Highness the Princess on his knees."Grivois had not been instructed as to a visit made to the
Princess Saint-Dizier by Rodin (for he was the man in the cloak), in the
middle of the night, after he had become certain of the arrival in Paris
of General Simon's daughters; or whether Mrs.Grivois thought it
necessary to appear ignorant of the visit, she replied, shrugging her
shoulders disdainfully: "I know not what you, mean, madame.I have not
come here to listen to your impertinent stuff.Once again I ask you--will
you, or will you not, introduce me to the presence of Miss Adrienne?""I repeat, madame, that my mistress sleeps, and that she has forbidden me
to enter her bed-chamber before mid-day."This conversation took place at some distance from the summer-house, at a
spot from which the peristyle could be seen at the end of a grand avenue,
terminating in trees arranged in form of a V. All at once Mrs.Grivois,
extending her hand in that direction, exclaimed: "Great heavens!"I saw her run up the porch steps.I perfectly recognized her by her
gait, by her hat, and by her mantle.To come home at eight o'clock in the
morning!"Grivois: "it is perfectly incredible!"and Georgette burst out into
fits of laughter: and then said: "Oh!you wish to out-do my
story of the four-wheeler last night!Grivois, "that I have this moment seen--"

"Oh!Grivois: if you speak seriously, you are mad!"The little gate that
open's on the street lets one into the quincunx near the pavilion.It is
by that door, doubtless, that mademoiselle has re-entered.her presentiments
have not yet been mistaken.See to what her weak indulgence of her
niece's caprices has led her!It is monstrous!--so monstrous, that,
though I have seen her with my own eyes, still I can scarcely believe
it!""Since you've gone so far, ma'am, I now insist upon conducting you into
the apartment of my lady, in order that you may convince yourself, by
your own senses, that your eyes have deceived you!""Oh, you are very cunning, my dear, but not more cunning than I!Yes, yes, I believe you: you are certain that by
this time I shall find her in her apartment!""But, madame, I assure you--"

"All that I can say to you is this: that neither you, nor Florine, nor
Hebe, shall remain here twenty-four hours.The Princess will put an end
to this horrible scandal; for I shall immediately inform her of what has
passed.Re-enter at eight o'clock in the morning!Why, I am all in a whirl!Certainly, if I had not seen it with my own
eyes, I could not have believed it!Still, it is only what was to be
expected.All those to whom I am
going to relate it, will say, I am quite sure, that it is not at all
astonishing!Grivois returned precipitately towards the mansion, followed by her
fat pug, who appeared to be as embittered as herself.Georgette, active and light, ran, on her part, towards the pavilion, in
order to apprise Miss de Cardoville that Mrs.Grivois had seen her, or
fancied she had seen her, furtively enter by the little garden gate.ADRIENNE AT HER TOILET.Grivois had seen or pretended to
have seen Adrienne de Cardoville re-enter in the morning the extension of
Saint-Dizier House.It is for the purpose, not of excusing, but of rendering intelligible,
the following scenes, that it is deemed necessary to bring out into the
light some striking peculiarities in the truly original character of Miss
de Cardoville.This originality consisted in an excessive independence of mind, joined
to a natural horror of whatsoever is repulsive or deformed, and to an
insatiable desire of being surrounded by everything attractive and
beautiful.The painter most delighted with coloring and beauty, the
sculptor most charmed by proportions of form, feel not more than Adrienne
did the noble enthusiasm which the view of perfect beauty always excites
in the chosen favorites of nature.And it was not only the pleasures of sight which this young lady loved to
gratify: the harmonious modulations of song, the melody of instruments,
the cadences of poetry, afforded her infinite pleasures; while a harsh
voice or a discordant noise made her feel the same painful impression, or
one nearly as painful as that which she involuntarily experienced from
the sight of a hideous object.Passionately fond of flowers, too, and of
their sweet scents, there are some perfumes which she enjoyed equally
with the delights of music or those of plastic beauty.It is necessary,
alas, to acknowledge one enormity: Adrienne was dainty in her food!She
valued more than any one else the fresh pulp of handsome fruit, the
delicate savor of a golden pheasant, cooked to a turn, and the odorous
cluster of a generous vine.But Adrienne enjoyed all these pleasures with an exquisite reserve.She
sought religiously to cultivate and refine the senses given her.She
would have deemed it black ingratitude to blunt those divine gifts by
excesses, or to debase them by unworthy selections of objects upon which
to exercise them; a fault from which, indeed, she was preserved by the
excessive and imperious delicacy of her taste.The BEAUTIFUL and the UGLY occupied for her the places which GOOD and
EVIL holds for others.Her devotion to grace, elegance, and physical beauty, had led her also to
the adoration of moral beauty; for if the expression of a low and bad
passion render uncomely the most beautiful countenances, those which are
in themselves the most ugly are ennobled, on the contrary, by the
expression of good feelings and generous sentiments.In a word, Adrienne was the most complete, the most ideal personification
of SENSUALITY--not of vulgar, ignorant, non intelligent, mistaken
sensuousness which is always deceit ful and corrupted by habit or by the
necessity for gross and ill-regulated enjoyments, but that exquisite
sensuality which is to the senses what intelligence is to the soul.The independence of this young lady's character was extreme.Certain
humiliating subjections imposed upon her success by its social position,
above all things were revolting to her, and she had the hardihood to
resolve to withdraw herself from them.She was a woman, the most womanish
that it is possible to imagine--a woman in her timidity as well as in her
audacity--a woman in her hatred of the brutal despotism of men, as well
as in her intense disposition to self-devoting herself, madly even and
blindly, to him who should merit such a devotion from her--a woman whose
piquant wit was occasionally paradoxical--a superior woman, in brief, who
entertained a well-grounded disdain and contempt for certain men either
placed very high or greatly adulated, whom she had from time to time met
in the drawing-room of her aunt, the Princess Saint-Dizier, when she
resided with her.These indispensable explanations being given, we usher, the reader into
the presence of Adrienne de Cardoville, who had just come out of the
bath.It would require all the brilliant colorings of the Venetian school to
represent that charming scene, which would rather seem to have occurred
in the sixteenth century, in some palace of Florence or Bologna, than in
Paris, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the month of February, 1832.Adrienne's dressing-room was a kind of miniature temple seemingly one
erected and dedicated to the worship of beauty, in gratitude to the Maker
who has lavished so many charms upon woman, not to be neglected by her,
or to cover and conceal them with ashes, or to destroy them by the
contact of her person with sordid and harsh haircloth; but in order that,
with fervent gratitude for the divine gifts wherewith she is endowed, she
may enhance her charms with all the illusions of grace and all the
splendors of apparel, so as to glorify the divine work of her own
perfections in the eyes of all.Daylight was admitted into this
semicircular apartment, through one of those double windows, contrived
for the preservation of heat, so happily imported from Germany.The walls
of the pavilion being constructed of stone of great thickness, the depth
of the aperture for the windows was therefore very great.That of
Adrienne's dressing-room was closed on the outside by a sash containing a
single large pane of plate glass, and within, by another large plate of
ground glass.In the interval or space of about three feet left between
these two transparent enclosures, there was a case or box filled with
furze mould, whence sprung forth climbing plants, which, directed round
the ground glass, formed a rich garland of leaves and flowers.A garnet
damask tapestry, rich with harmoniously blended arabesques, in the purest
style, covered the walls and a thick carpet of similar color was extended
over the floor: and this sombre ground, presented by the floor and walls,
marvellously enhanced the effects of all the harmonious ornaments and
decorations of the chamber.Under the window, opposite to the south, was placed Adrienne's dressing
case, a real masterpiece of the skill of the goldsmith.Upon a large
tablet of lapis-lazuli, there were scattered boxes of jewels, their lids
precisely enamelled; several scent boxes of rock crystal, and other
implements and utensils of the toilet, some formed of shells, some of
mother-of-pearl, and others of ivory, covered with ornaments of gold in
extraordinary taste.Two large figures, modelled in silver with antique
purity; supported an oval swing mirror, which had for its rim, in place
of a frame curiously carved, a fresh garland of natural flowers, renewed
every day like a nosegay for a ball.Two enormous Japanese vases, of purple and gold, three feet each in
diameter, were placed upon the carpet on each side of the toilet, and,
filled with camellias, ibiscures, and cape jasmine, in full flower formed
a sort of grove, diversified with the most brilliant colors.At the
farther end of the apartment, opposite the casement, was to be seen,
surrounded by another mass of flowers, a reduction in white marble of the
enchanting group of Daphnis and Chloe, the more chaste ideal of graceful
modesty and youthful beauty.Two golden lamps burned perfumes upon the same pedestal which supported
those two charming figures.A coffer of frosted silver, set off with
small figures in jewelry and precious stones, and supported on four feet
of gilt bronze, contained various necessaries for the toilette; two
frosted Psyches, decorated with diamond ear-rings; some excellent
drawings from Raphael and Titian, painted by Adrienne herself, consisting
of portraits of both men and women of exquisite beauty; several consoles
of oriental jasper, supporting ewers and basins of silver and of silver
gilt, richly chased and filled with scented waters; a voluptuously rich
divan, some seats, and an illuminated gilt fable, completed the furniture
of this chamber, the atmosphere of which was impregnated with the
sweetest perfumes.Adrienne, whom her attendants had just helped from the bath, was seated
before her toilette, her three women surrounding her.By a caprice, or
rather by a necessary and logical impulse of her soul, filled as it was
with the love of beauty and of harmony in all things, Adrienne had wished
the young women who served her to be very pretty, and be dressed with
attention and with a charming originality.We have already seen
Georgette, a piquante blonde, attired in her attractive costume of an
intriguing lady's maid of Marivaux; and her two companions were quite
equal to her both in gracefulness and gentility.One of them, named Florine, a tall, delicately slender, and elegant girl,
with the air and form of Diana Huntress, was of a pale brown complexion.Her thick black hair was turned up behind, where it was fastened with a
long golden pin.Like the two other girls, her arms were uncovered to
facilitate the performance of her duties about and upon the person of her
charming mistress.She wore a dress of that gay green so familiar to the
Venetian painters.Her slender waist curved
in from under the plaits of a tucker of white cambric, plaited in five
minute folds, and fastened by five gold buttons.The third of Adrienne's
women had a face so fresh and ingenuous, a waist so delicate, so
pleasing, and so finished, that her mistress had given her the name of
Hebe.Her dress of a delicate rose color, and Grecian cut, displayed her
charming neck, and her beautiful arms up to the very shoulders.The
physiognomy of these three young women was laughter loving and happy.On
their features there was no expression of that bitter sullenness, willing
and hated obedience, or offensive familiarity, or base and degraded
deference, which are the ordinary results of a state of servitude.In the
zealous eagerness of the cares and attentions which they lavished upon
Adrienne, there seemed to be at least as much of affection as of
deference and respect.They appeared to derive an ardent pleasure from
the services which they rendered to their lovely mistress.One would have
thought that they attached to the dressing and embellishment of her
person all the merits and the enjoyment arising from the execution of a
work of art, in the accomplishing of which, fruitful of delights, they
were stimulated by the passions of love, of pride, and of joy.The sun beamed brightly upon the toilet-case, placed in front of the
window.Adrienne was seated on a chair, its back elevated a little more
than usual.She was enveloped in a long morning-gown of blue silk,
embroidered with a leaf of the same color, which was fitted close to her
waist, as exquisitely slender and delicate as that of a child of twelve
years, by a girdle with floating tags.Her neck, delicately slender and
flexible as a bird's, was uncovered, as were also her shoulders and arms,
and all were of incomparable beauty.Despite the vulgarity of the
comparison, the purest ivory alone can give an idea of the dazzling
whiteness of her polished satin skin, of a texture so fresh and so firm,
that some drops of water, collected and still remaining about the roots
of her hair from the bath, rolled in serpentine lines over her shoulders,
like pearls, or beads, of crystal, over white marble.And what gave enhanced lustre to this wondrous carnation, known but to
auburn-headed beauties, was the deep purple of her, humid lips,--the
roseate transparency of her small ears, of her dilated nostrils, and her
nails, as bright and glossy, as if they had been varnished.In every
spot, indeed, where her pure arterial blood, full of animation and heat,
could make its way to the skin and shine through the surface, it
proclaimed her high health and the vivid life and joyous buoyancy of her
glorious youth.Her eyes were very large, and of a velvet softness.Now
they glanced, sparkling and shining with comic humor or intelligence and
wit; and now they widened and extended themselves, languishing and
swimming between their double fringes of long crisp eyelashes, of as deep
a black as her finely-drawn and exquisitely arched eyebrows; for, by a
delightful freak of nature, she had black eyebrows and eyelashes to
contrast with the golden red of her hair.Her forehead, small like those
of ancient Grecian statues, formed with the rest of her face a perfect
oval.Her nose, delicately curved, was slightly aquiline; the enamel of
her teeth glistened when the light fell upon them; and her vermeil mouth
voluptuously sensual, seemed to call for sweet kisses, and the gay smiles
and delectations of dainty and delicious pleasure.It is impossible to
behold or to conceive a carriage of the head freer, more noble, or more
elegant than hers; thanks to the great distance which separated the neck
and the ear from their attachment to her outspread and dimpled shoulders.We have already said that Adrienne was red-haired; but it was the redness
of many of the admirable portraits of women by Titian and Leonardo da
Vinci,--that is to say, molten gold presents not reflections more
delightfully agreeable or more glittering, than the naturally undulating
mass of her very long hair, as soft and fine as silk, so long, that, when
let loose, it reached the floor; in it, she could wholly envelop herself,
like another Venus arising from the sea.At the present moment,
Adrienne's tresses were ravishing to behold; Georgette, her arms bare,
stood behind her mistress, and had carefully collected into one of her
small white hands, those splendid threads whose naturally ardent
brightness was doubled in the sunshine.When the pretty lady's-maid
pulled a comb of ivory into the midst of the undulating and golden waves
of that enormously magnificent skein of silk, one might have said that a
thousand sparks of fire darted forth and coruscated away from it in all
directions.The sunshine, too, reflected not less golden and fiery rays
from numerous clusters of spiral ringlets, which, divided upon Adrienne's
forehead, fell over her cheeks, and in their elastic flexibility caressed
the risings of her snowy bosom, to whose charming undulations they
adapted and applied themselves.Whilst Georgette, standing, combed the
beautiful locks of her mistress, Hebe, with one knee upon the floor, and
having upon the other the sweet little foot of Miss Cardoville, busied
herself in fitting it with a remarkably small shoe of black satin, and
crossed its slender ties over a silk stocking of a pale yet rosy flesh
color, which imprisoned the smallest and finest ankle in the world.Florine, a little farther back, presented to her mistress, in a jeweled
box, a perfumed paste, with which Adrienne slightly rubbed her dazzling
hands and outspread fingers, which seemed tinted with carmine to their
extremities.Let us not forget Frisky, who, couched in the lap of her
mistress, opened her great eyes with all her might, and seemed to observe
the different operations of Adrienne's toilette with grave and reflective
attention.A silver bell being sounded from without, Florine, at a sign
from her mistress, went out and presently returned, bearing a letter upon
a small silver-gilt salve.Adrienne, while her women continued fitting on
her shoes, dressing her hair, and arranging her in her habiliments, took
the letter, which was written by the steward of the estate of Cardoville,
and read aloud as follows:

"HONORED MADAME,

"Knowing your goodness of heart and generosity, I venture to address you
with respectful confidence.During twenty years I served the late Count
and Duke of Cardoville, your noble father, I believe I may truly say,
with probity and zeal.The castle is now sold; so that I and my wife, in
our old age, behold ourselves about to be dismissed, and left destitute
of all resources: which, alas!said Adrienne, interrupting herself in reading: "my
father, certainly, always prided himself upon their devotion to him, and
their probity."She continued:

"There does, indeed, remain to us a means of retaining our place here;
but it would constrain us to be guilty of baseness; and, be the
consequences to us what they may, neither I nor my wife wish to purchase
our bread at such a price.""Good, very good," said Adrienne, "always the same--dignity even in
poverty--it is the sweet perfume of a flower, not the less sweet because
it has bloomed in a meadow.""In order to explain to you, honored madame, the unworthy task exacted
from us, it is necessary to inform you, in the first place, that M. Rodin
came here from Paris two days ago."said Mademoiselle de Cardoville, interrupting herself
anew; "the secretary of Abbe d'Aigrigny!I am not at all surprised at him
being engaged in a perfidious or black intrigue."M. Rodin came from Paris to announce to us that the estate was sold, and
that he was sure of being able to obtain our continuance in our place, if
we would assist him in imposing a priest not of good character upon the
new proprietress as her future confessor; and if, the better to attain
this end, we would consent to calumniate another priest, a deserving and
excellent man, much loved and much respected in the country.I was required to write twice or thrice a week to M. Rodin, and
to relate to him everything that should occur in the house.I ought to
acknowledge, honored madame, that these infamous proposals were as much
as possible disguised and dissimulated under sufficiently specious
pretexts; but, notwithstanding the aspect which with more or less skill
it was attempted to give to the affair, it was precisely and
substantially what I have now had the honor of stating to you.""Corruption, calumny, and false and treacherous impeachment!"said
Adrienne, with disgust: "I cannot think of such wretches without
involuntarily feeling my mind shocked by dismal ideas of black, venomous,
and vile reptiles, of aspects most hideous indeed.How much more do I
love to dwell upon the consoling thought of honest Dupont and his wife!"Adrienne proceeded:

"Believe me, we hesitated not an instant.We quit Cardoville, which has
been our home for the last twenty years;--but we shall quit it like
honest people, and with the consciousness of our integrity.And now,
honored madame, if, in the brilliant circle in which you move--you, who
are so benevolent and amiable--could find a place for us by your
recommendation, then, with endless gratitude to you, we shall escape from
a position of most cruel embarrassment.""Surely, surely," said Adrienne, "they shall not in vain appeal to me.To
wrest excellent persons from the grip of M. Rodin, is not only a duty but
a pleasure: for it is at once a righteous and a dangerous enterprise; and
dearly do I love to brave powerful oppressors!"Adrienne again went on
reading:

"After having thus spoken to you of ourselves, honored madame, permit us
to implore your protection for other unfortunates; for it would be wicked
to think only of one's self.Three days ago, two shipwrecks took place
upon our ironbound coast.A few passengers only were saved, and were
conducted hither, where I and my wife gave them all necessary attentions.All these passengers have departed for Paris, except one, who still
remains, his wounds having hitherto prevented him from leaving the house,
and, indeed, they will constrain him to remain for some days to come.He
is a young East Indian prince, of about twenty years of age, and he
appears to be as amiable and good as he is handsome, which is not a
little to say, though he has a tawny skin, like the rest of his
countrymen, as I understand."exclaimed Adrienne, gayly; "this is quite delightful, and not at all of
an ordinary or vulgar nature!this Indian prince has already awakened
all my sympathies!But what can I do with this Adonis from the banks of
the Ganges, who has come to wreck himself upon the Picardy coast?"Adrienne's three women looked at her with much astonishment, though they
were accustomed to the singular eccentricities of her character.Georgette and Hebe even indulged in discreet and restrained smiles.Florine, the tall and beautiful pale brown girl, also smiled like her
pretty companions; but it was after a short pause of seeming reflection,
as if she had previously been entirely engrossed in listening to and
recollecting the minutest words of her mistress, who, though powerfully
interested by the situation of the "Adonis from Ganges banks," as she had
called him, continued to read Dupont's letter:

"One of the countrymen of the Indian prince, who has also remained to
attend upon him, has given me to understand that the youthful prince has
lost in the shipwreck all he possessed, and knows not how to get to
Paris, where his speedy presence is required by some affairs of the very
greatest importance.It is not from the prince himself that I have
obtained this information: no; he appears to be too dignified and proud
to proclaim of his fate: but his countryman, more communicative,
confidentially told me what I have stated, adding, that his young
compatriot has already been subjected to great calamities, and that his
father, who was the sovereign of an Indian kingdom, has been killed by
the English, who have also dispossessed his son of his crown.""This is very singular," said Adrienne, thoughtfully."These
circumstances recall to my mind that my father often mentioned that one
of our relations was espoused in India by a native monarch; and that
General Simon: (whom they have created a marshal) had entered into his
service."Then interrupting herself to indulge in a smile, she added,
"Gracious!this affair will be quite odd and fantastical!Such things
happen to nobody but me; and then people say that I am the uncommon
creature!But it seems to me that it is not I, but Providence, which, in
truth, sometimes shows itself very eccentric!But let us see if worthy
Dupont gives the name of this handsome prince?""We trust, honored madame, that you will pardon our boldness: but we
should have thought ourselves very selfish, if, while stating to you our
own griefs, we had not also informed you that there is with us a brave
and estimable prince involved in so much distress.In fine, lady, trust
to me; I am old; and I have had much experience of men; and it was only
necessary to see the nobleness of expression and the sweetness of
countenance of this young Indian, to enable me to judge that he is worthy
of the interest which I have taken the liberty to request in his behalf.It would be sufficient to transmit to him a small sum of money for the
purchase of some European clothing; for he has lost all his Indian
vestments in the shipwreck."Heaven preserve him from that; and me also!Chance has sent
hither from the heart of India, a mortal so far favored as never to have
worn the abominable European costume--those hideous habits, and frightful
hats, which render the men so ridiculous, so ugly, that in truth there is
not a single good quality to be discovered in them, nor one spark of what
can either captivate or attract!There comes to me at last a handsome
young prince from the East, where the men are clothed in silk and
cashmere.Most assuredly I'll not miss this rare and unique opportunity
of exposing myself to a very serious and formidable temptation!not a European dress for me, though poor Dupont requests it!But the
name--the name of this dear prince!Once more, what a singular event is
this!If it should turn out to be that cousin from beyond the Ganges!During my childhood, I have heard so much in praise of his royal father!I shall be quite ravished to give his son the kind reception which he
merits!"And then she read on:

"If, besides this small sum, honored madame, you are so kind as to give
him, and also his companion, the means of reaching Paris, you will confer
a very great service upon this poor young prince, who is at present so
unfortunate."To conclude, I know enough of your delicacy to be aware that it would
perhaps be agreeable to you to afford this succor to the prince without
being known as his benefactress; in which case, I beg that you will be
pleased to command me; and you may rely upon my discretion.If, on the
contrary, you wish to address it directly to himself, his name is, as it
has been written for me by his countrymen, Prince Djalma, son of Radja
sing, King of Mundi."said Adrienne, quickly, and appearing to call up her
recollections, "Radja-sing!These are the very names
that my father so often repeated, while telling me that there was nothing
more chivalric or heroic in the world than the old king, our relation by
marriage; and the son has not derogated, it would seem, from that
character.Yes, Djalma, Radja-sing--once more, that is it--such names are
not so common," she added, smiling, "that one should either forget or
confound them with others.above all, he has never worn the horrid
European dress!Quick, quick let us improvise a pretty
fairy tale, of which the handsome and beloved prince shall be the hero!The poor bird of the golden and azure plumage has wandered into our
dismal climate; but he will find here, at least, something to remind him
of his native region of sunshine and perfumes!"Then, addressing one of
her women, she said: "Georgette, take paper and write, my child!"The
young girl went to the gilt, illuminated table, which contained materials
for writing; and, having seated herself, she said to her mistress: "I
await orders."Adrienne de Cardoville, whose charming countenance was radiant with the
gayety of happiness and joy, proceeded to dictate the following letter to
a meritorious old painter, who had long since taught her the arts of
drawing and designing; in which arts she excelled, as indeed she did in
all others:

"MY DEAR TITIAN, MY GOOD VERONESE, MY WORTHY RAPHAEL."You can render me a very great service,--and you will do it, I am sure,
with that perfect and obliging complaisance by which you are ever
distinguished."It is to go immediately and apply yourself to the skillful hand who
designed my last costumes of the fifteenth century.But the present
affair is to procure modern East Indian dresses for a young man--yes,
sir--for a young man,--and according to what I imagine of him, I fancy
that you can cause his measure to be taken from the Antinous, or rather,
from the Indian Bacchus; yes--that will be more likely."It is necessary that these vestments be at once of perfect propriety and
correctness, magnificently rich, and of the greatest elegance.You will
choose the most beautiful stuffs possible; and endeavor, above all
things, that they be, or resemble, tissues of Indian manufacture; and you
will add to them, for turbans and sashes, six splendid long cashmere
shawls, two of them white, two red, and two orange; as nothing suits
brown complexions better than those colors."This done (and I allow you at the utmost only two or three days), you
will depart post in my carriage for Cardoville Manor House, which you
know so well.The steward, the excellent Dupont, one of your old friends,
will there introduce you to a young Indian Prince, named Djalma; and you
will tell that most potent grave, and reverend signior, of another
quarter of the globe, that you have come on the part of an unknown
friend, who, taking upon himself the duty of a brother, sends him what is
necessary to preserve him from the odious fashions of Europe.You will
add, that his friend expects him with so much impatience that he conjures
him to come to Paris immediately.If he objects that he is suffering, you
will tell him that my carriage is an excellent bed-closet; and you will
cause the bedding, etc., which it contains, to be fitted up, till he
finds it quite commodious.Remember to make very humble excuses for the
unknown friend not sending to the prince either rich palanquins, or even,
modestly, a single elephant; for alas!palanquins are only to be seen at
the opera; and there are no elephants but those in the menagerie,--though
this must make us seem strangely barbarous in his eyes."As soon as you shall have decided on your departure, perform the journey
as rapidly as possible, and bring here, into my house, in the Rue de
Babylone (what predestination!that I should dwell in the street of
BABYLON,--a name which must at least accord with the ear of an
Oriental),--you will bring hither, I say, this dear prince, who is so
happy as to have been born in a country of flowers, diamonds, and sun!"Above all, you will have the kindness, my old and worthy friend, not to
be at all astonished at this new freak, and refrain from indulging in
extravagant conjectures.Seriously, the choice which I have made of you
in this affair,--of you, whom I esteem and most sincerely honor,--is
because it is sufficient to say to you that, at the bottom of all this,
there is something more than a seeming act of folly."In uttering these last words, the tone of Adrienne was as serious and
dignified as it had been previously comic and jocose.But she quickly
resumed, more gayly, dictating to Georgette.I am something like that commander of ancient
days, whose heroic nose and conquering chin you have so often made me
draw: I jest with the utmost freedom of spirit even in the moment of
battle: yes, for within an hour I shall give battle, a pitched battle--to
my dear pew-dwelling aunt.Fortunately, audacity and courage never failed
me, and I burn with impatience for the engagement with my austere
princess."A kiss, and a thousand heartfelt recollections to your excellent wife.If I speak of her here, who is so justly respected, you will please to
understand, it is to make you quite at ease as to the consequences of
this running away with, for my sake, a charming young prince,--for it is
proper to finish well where I should have begun, by avowing to you that
he is charming indeed!Then, addressing Georgette, said she, "Have you done writing, chit?""P.S.--I send you draft on sight on my banker for all expenses.You know I am quite a grand seigneur.I must use this masculine
expression, since your sex have exclusively appropriated to yourselves
(tyrants as you are) a term, so significant as it is of noble
generosity.""Now, Georgette," said Adrienne; "bring me an envelope, and the letter,
that I may sign it."Mademoiselle de Cardoville took the pen that
Georgette presented to her, signed the letter, and enclosed in it an
order upon her banker, which was expressed thus:

"Please pay M. Norval, on demand without grace, the sum of money he may
require for expenses incurred on my account."ADRIENNE DE CARDOVILLE."During all this scene, while Georgette wrote, Florine and Hebe had
continued to busy themselves with the duties of their mistress's
toilette, who had put off her morning gown, and was now in full dress, in
order to wait upon the princess, her aunt.From the sustained and
immovably fixed attention with which Florine had listened to Adrienne's
dictating to Georgette her letter to M. Norval, it might easily have been
seen that, as was her habit indeed, she endeavored to retain in her
memory even the slightest words of her mistress."Now, chit," said Adrienne to Hebe, "send this letter immediately to M.The same silver bell was again rung from without.Hebe moved towards the
door of the dressing-room, to go and inquire what it was, and also to
execute the order of her mistress as to the letter.But Florine
precipitated herself, so to speak, before her, and so as to prevent her
leaving the apartment; and said to Adrienne:

"Will it please my lady for me to send this letter?I have occasion to go
to the mansion.""Go, Florine, then," said Adrienne, "seeing that you wish it.Georgette,
seal the letter."At the end of a second or two, during which Georgette had sealed the
letter, Hebe returned."Madame," said she, re-entering, "the working-man who brought back Frisky
yesterday, entreats you to admit him for an instant.He is very pale, and
he appears quite sad.""Would that he may already have need of me!"Show the excellent young man into the little saloon.And, Florine, despatch this letter immediately."Miss de Cardoville, followed by Frisky, entered the
little reception-room, where Agricola awaited her.When Adrienne de Cardoville entered the saloon where Agricola expected
her, she was dressed with extremely elegant simplicity.A robe of deep
blue, perfectly fitted to her shape, embroidered in front with
interlacings of black silk, according to the then fashion, outlined her
nymph-like figure, and her rounded bosom.A French cambric collar,
fastened by a large Scotch pebble, set as a brooch, served her for a
necklace.Her magnificent golden hair formed a framework for her fair
countenance, with an incredible profusion of long and light spiral
tresses, which reached nearly to her waist.Agricola, in order to save explanations with his father, and to make him
believe that he had indeed gone to the workshop of M. Hardy, had been
obliged to array himself in his working dress; he had put on a new blouse
though, and the collar of his shirt, of stout linen, very white, fell
over upon a black cravat, negligently tied; his gray trousers allowed his
well polished boots to be seen; and he held between his muscular hands a
cap of fine woolen cloth, quite new.To sum up, his blue blouse,
embroidered with red, showing off the nervous chest of the young
blacksmith, and indicating his robust shoulders, falling down in graceful
folds, put not the least constraint upon his free and easy gait, and
became him much better than either frock-coat or dress-coat would have
done.While awaiting Miss de Cardoville, Agricola mechanically examined a
magnificent silver vase, admirably graven.A small tablet, of the same
metal, fitted into a cavity of its antique stand, bore the words--"Chased
by JEAN MARIE, working chaser, 1831."Adrienne had stepped so lightly upon the carpet of her saloon, only
separated from another apartment by the doors, that Agricola had not
perceived the young lady's entrance.He started, and turned quickly
round, upon hearing a silver and brilliant voice say to him-"That is a
beautiful vase, is it not, sir?""Very beautiful, madame," answered Agricola greatly embarrassed."You may see from it that I like what is equitable."added Miss de
Cardoville, pointing with her finger to the little silver tablet;--"an
artist puts his name upon his painting; an author publishes his on the
title-page of his book; and I contend that an artisan ought also to have
his name connected with his workmanship.""Oh, madame, so this name?""Is that of the poor chaser who executed this masterpiece, at the order
of a rich goldsmith.When the latter sold me the vase, he was amazed at
my eccentricity, he would have almost said at my injustice, when, after
having made him tell me the name of the author of this production, I
ordered his name to be inscribed upon it, instead of that of the
goldsmith, which had already been affixed to the stand.In the absence of
the rich profits, let the artisan enjoy the fame of his skill.It would have been impossible for Adrienne to commence the conversation
more graciously: so that the blacksmith, already beginning to feel a
little more at ease, answered:

"Being a mechanic myself, madame, I cannot but be doubly affected by such
a proof of your sense of equity and justice.""Since you are a mechanic, sir," resumed Adrienne, "I cannot but
felicitate myself on having so suitable a hearer.With a gesture full of affability, she pointed to an armchair of purple
silk embroidered with gold, sitting down herself upon a tete-a-tete of
the same materials.Seeing Agricola's hesitation, who again cast down his eyes with
embarrassment, Adrienne, to encourage him, showed him Frisky, and said to
him gayly: "This poor little animal, to which I am very much attached,
will always afford me a lively remembrance of your obliging complaisance,
sir.And this visit seems to me to be of happy augury; I know not what
good presentiment whispers to me, that perhaps I shall have the pleasure
of being useful to you in some affair.""Madame," said Agricola, resolutely, "my name is Baudoin: a blacksmith in
the employment of M. Hardy, at Pressy, near the city.Yesterday you
offered me your purse and I refused it: to-day, I have come to request of
you perhaps ten or twenty times the sum that you had generously proposed.I have said thus much all at once, madame, because it causes me the
greatest effort.The words blistered my lips, but now I shall be more at
ease.""I appreciate the delicacy of your scruples, sir," said Adrienne; "but if
you knew me, you would address me without fear."I do not know, madame," answered Agricola."No madame; and I come to you to request, not only the sum necessary to
me, but also information as to what that sum is.""Let us see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling, "explain this to me.In spite
of my good will, you feel that I cannot divine, all at once, what it is
that is required.""Madame, in two words, I can state the truth.I have a food old mother,
who in her youth, broke her health by excessive labor, to enable her to
bring me up; and not only me, but a poor abandoned child whom she had
picked up.It is my turn now to maintain her; and that I have the
happiness of doing.But in order to do so, I have only my labor.If I am
dragged from my employment, my mother will be without support.""Your mother cannot want for anything now, sir, since I interest myself
for her.""You will interest yourself for her, madame?""But you don't know her," exclaimed the blacksmith.said Agricola, with emotion, after a moment's silence.said Adrienne, looking at Agricola with a very surprised
air; for what he said to her was an enigma.The blacksmith, who blushed not for his friends, replied frankly."Madame, permit me to explain, to you.Mother Bunch is a poor and very
industrious young workwoman, with whom I have been brought up.She is
deformed, which is the reason why she is called Mother Bunch.But though,
on the one hand, she is sunk, as low as you are highly elevated on the
other, yet as regards the heart--as to delicacy--oh, lady, I am certain
that your heart is of equal worth with hers!That was at once her own
thought, after I had related to her in what manner, yesterday, you had
presented me with that beautiful flower.""I can assure you, sir," said Adrienne, sincerely touched, "that this
comparison flatters and honors me more than anything else that you could
say to me,--a heart that remains good and delicate, in spite of cruel
misfortunes, is so rare a treasure; while it is very easy to be good,
when we have youth and beauty, and to be delicate and generous, when we
are rich.I accept, then, your comparison; but on condition that you will
quickly put me in a situation to deserve it.In spite of the gracious cordiality of Miss de Cardoville, there was
always observable in her so much of that natural dignity which arises
from independence of character, so much elevation of soul and nobleness
of sentiment that Agricola, forgetting the ideal physical beauty of his
protectress, rather experienced for her the emotions of an affectionate
and kindly, though profound respect, which offered a singular and
striking contrast with the youth and gayety of the lovely being who
inspired him with this sentiment."If my mother alone, madame, were exposed to the rigor which I dread.I
should not be so greatly disquieted with the fear of a compulsory
suspension of my employment.Among poor people, the poor help one
another; and my mother is worshipped by all the inmates of our house, our
excellent neighbors, who would willingly succor her.But, they themselves
are far from being well off; and as they would incur privations by
assisting her, their little benefit would still be more painful to my
mother than the endurance even of misery by herself.And besides, it is
not only for my mother that my exertions are required, but for my father,
whom we have not seen for eighteen years, and who has just arrived from
Siberia, where he remained during all that time, from zealous devotion to
his former general, now Marshal Simon."said Adrienne, quickly, with an expression of much
surprise."Do you know the marshal, madame?""I do not personally know him, but he married a lady of our family."exclaimed the blacksmith, "then the two young ladies, his
daughters, whom my father has brought from Russia, are your relations!"asked Adrienne, more and more
astonished and interested."Yes, madame, two little angels of fifteen or sixteen, and so pretty, so
sweet; they are twins so very much alike, as to be mistaken for one
another.Their mother died in exile; and the little she possessed having
been confiscated, they have come hither with my father, from the depths
of Siberia, travelling very wretchedly; but he tried to make them forget
so many privations by the fervency of his devotion and his tenderness.you will not believe, madame, that, with the courage of
a lion, he has all the love and tenderness of a mother.""And where are the dear children, sir?"It is that which renders my position so very hard;
that which has given me courage to come to you; it is not but that my
labor would be sufficient for our little household, even thus augmented;
but that I am about to be arrested.""Pray, madame, have the goodness to read this letter, which has been sent
by some one to Mother Bunch."Agricola gave to Miss de Cardoville the anonymous letter which had been
received by the workwoman.After having read the letter, Adrienne said to the blacksmith, with
surprise, "It appears, sir, you are a poet!""I have neither the ambition nor the pretension to be one, madame.Only,
when I return to my mother after a day's toil, and often, even while
forging my iron, in order to divert and relax my attention, I amuse
myself with rhymes, sometimes composing an ode, sometimes a song.""And your song of the Freed Workman, which is mentioned in this letter,
is, therefore, very disaffected--very dangerous?""Oh, no, madame; quite the contrary.For myself, I have the good fortune
to be employed in the factory of M. Hardy, who renders the condition of
his workpeople as happy as that of their less fortunate comrades is the
reverse; and I had limited myself to attempt, in favor of the great mass
of the working classes, an equitable, sincere, warm, and earnest
claim--nothing more.But you are aware, perhaps, Madame, that in times of
conspiracy, and commotion, people are often incriminated and imprisoned
on very slight grounds.Should such a misfortune befall me, what will
become of my mother, my father, and the two orphans whom we are bound to
regard as part of our family until the return of their father, Marshal
Simon?It is on this account, madame, that, if I remain, I run the risk
of being arrested.I have come to you to request you to provide surety
for me; so that I should not be compelled to exchange the workshop for
the prison, in which case I can answer for it that the fruits of my labor
will suffice for all."said Adrienne, gayly, "this affair will arrange itself
quite easily.Poet, you shall draw your inspirations in
the midst of good fortune instead of adversity.But first of
all, bonds shall be given for you.""Oh, madame, you have saved us!""To continue," said Adrienne, "the physician of our family is intimately
connected with a very important minister (understand that, as you like,"
said she, smiling, "you will not deceive yourself much).The doctor
exercises very great influence over this great statesman; for he has
always had the happiness of recommending to him, on account of his
health; the sweets and repose of private life, to the very eve of the day
on which his portfolio was taken from him.Keep yourself, then, perfectly
at ease.If the surety be insufficient, we shall be able to devise some
other means."Madame," said Agricola, with great emotion, "I am indebted to you for
the repose, perhaps for the life of my mother.Believe that I shall ever
be grateful."It is proper that those
who have too much should have the right of coming to the aid of those who
have too little.Marshal Simon's daughters are members of my family, and
they will reside here with me, which will be more suitable.You will
apprise your worthy mother of this; and in the evening, besides going to
thank her for the hospitality which she has shown to my young relations,
I shall fetch them home."At this moment Georgette, throwing open the door which separated the room
from an adjacent apartment, hurriedly entered, with an affrighted look,
exclaiming:

"Oh, madame, something extraordinary is going on in the street.""I went to conduct my dressmaker to the little garden-gate," said
Georgette; "where I saw some ill-looking men, attentively examining the
walls and windows of the little out-building belonging to the pavilion,
as if they wished to spy out some one.""Madame," said Agricola, with chagrin, "I have not been deceived."I thought I was followed, from the moment when I left the Rue St.Merry:
and now it is beyond doubt.They must have seen me enter your house; and
are on the watch to arrest me.Well, now that your interest has been
acquired for my mother,--now that I have no farther uneasiness for
Marshal Simon's daughters,--rather than hazard your exposure to anything
the least unpleasant, I run to deliver myself up.""Beware of that sir," said Adrienne, quickly."Liberty is too precious to
be voluntarily sacrificed.Besides, Georgette may have been mistaken.But
in any case, I entreat you not to surrender yourself.Take my advice, and
escape being arrested.That, I think, will greatly facilitate my
measures; for I am of opinion that justice evinces a great desire to keep
possession of those upon whom she has once pounced.""Madame," said Hebe, now also entering with a terrified look, "a man
knocked at the little door, and inquired if a young man in a blue blouse
has not entered here.He added, that the person whom he seeks is named
Agricola Baudoin, and that he has something to tell him of great
importance.""That's my name," said Agricola; "but the important information is a
trick to draw me out.""Evidently," said Adrienne; "and therefore we must play off trick for
trick.added she, addressing herself to
Hebe."I answered, that I didn't know what he was talking about.""Quite right," said Adrienne: "and the man who put the question?""Without doubt to come back again, soon," said Agricola."That is very probable," said Adrienne, "and therefore, sir, it is
necessary for you to remain here some hours with resignation.I am
unfortunately obliged to go immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier, my
aunt, for an important interview, which can no longer be delayed, and is
rendered more pressing still by what you have told me concerning the
daughters of Marshal Simon.Remain here, then, sir; since if you go out,
you will certainly be arrested.""Madame, pardon my refusal; but I must say once more that I ought not to
accept this generous offer.""They have tried to draw me out, in order to avoid penetrating with the
power of the law into your dwelling but if I go not out, they will come
in; and never will I expose you to anything so disagreeable.Now that I
am no longer uneasy about my mother, what signifies prison?""And the grief that your mother will feel, her uneasiness, and her
fears,--nothing?Think of your father; and that poor work-woman who loves
you as a brother, and whom I value as a sister;--say, sir, do you forget
them also?Believe me, it is better to spare those torments to your
family.Remain here; and before the evening I am certain, either by
giving surety, or some other means, of delivering you from these
annoyances.""But, madame, supposing that I do accept your generous offer, they will
come and find me here."There is in this pavilion, which was formerly the abode of a
nobleman's left-handed wife,--you see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling,
"that live in a very profane place--there is here a secret place of
concealment, so wonderfully well-contrived, that it can defy all
searches.You will be very well
accommodated.You will even be able to write some verses for me, if the
place inspire you.""Oh, sir, I will tell you.Admitting that your character and your
position do not entitle you to any interest;--admitting that I may not
owe a sacred debt to your father for the touching regards and cares he
has bestowed upon the daughters of Marshal Simon, my relations--do you
forget Frisky, sir?"asked Adrienne, laughing,--"Frisky, there, whom you
have restored to my fondles?Seriously, if I laugh," continued this
singular and extravagant creature, "it is because I know that you are
entirely out of danger, and that I feel an increase of happiness.Therefore, sir, write for me quickly your address, and your mother's, in
this pocket-book; follow Georgette; and spin me some pretty verses, if
you do not bore yourself too much in that prison to which you fly."While Georgette conducted the blacksmith to the hiding-place, Hebe
brought her mistress a small gray beaver hat with a gray feather; for
Adrienne had to cross the park to reach the house occupied by the
Princess Saint-Dizier.A quarter of an hour after this scene, Florine entered mysteriously the
apartment of Mrs.Grivois, the first woman of the princess."Here are the notes which I have taken this morning," said Florine,
putting a paper into the duenna's hand."Happily, I have a good memory.""At what time exactly did she return home this morning?""She did not go out, madame.We put her in the bath at nine o'clock.""But before nine o'clock she came home, after having passed the night out
of her house.Eight o'clock was the time at which she returned, however."Grivois with profound astonishment, and said-"I do
not understand you, madame."Madame did not come home this morning at eight o'clock?"I was ill yesterday, and did not come down till nine this morning, in
order to assist Georgette and Hebe help our young lady from the bath.I
know nothing of what passed previously, I swear to you, madame."You must ferret out what I allude to from your
companions.They don't distrust you, and will tell you all.""What has your mistress done this morning since you saw her?""Madame dictated a letter to Georgette for M. Norval, I requested
permission to send it off, as a pretext for going out, and for writing
down all I recollected.""Jerome had to go out, and I gave it him to put in the post-office."Grivois: "couldn't you bring it to me?""But, as madame dictated it aloud to Georgette, as is her custom, I knew
the contents of the letter; and I have written it in my notes."It is likely there was need to delay sending
off this letter; the princess will be very much displeased.""I thought I did right, madame.""I know that it is not good will that fails you.For these six months I
have been satisfied with you.But this time you have committed a very
great mistake."Grivois looked fixedly at her, and said in a sardonic tone:

"Very well, my dear, do not continue it.If you have scruples, you are
free."You well know that I am not free, madame," said Florine, reddening; and
with tears in her eyes she added: "I am dependent upon M. Rodin, who
placed me here.""In spite of one's self, one feels remorse.Madame is so good, and so
confiding."But you are not here to sing her
praises."The working-man who yesterday found and brought back Frisky, came early
this morning and requested permission to speak with my young lady.""And is this working-man still in her house?"He came in when I was going out with the letter.""You must contrive to learn what it was this workingman came about.""Has your mistress seemed preoccupied, uneasy, or afraid of the interview
which she is to have to-day with the princess?She conceals so little of
what she thinks, that you ought to know."said the tire-woman, muttering between her teeth,
without Florine being able to hear her: "'They laugh most who laugh
last.'In spite of her audacious and diabolical character, she would
tremble, and would pray for mercy, if she knew what awaits her this day."Then addressing Florine, she continued-"Return, and keep yourself, I
advise you, from those fine scruples, which will be quite enough to do
you a bad turn."I cannot forget that I belong not to myself, madame."Florine quitted the mansion and crossed the park to regain the summer
house, while Mrs Grivois went immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier.So <DW53> and Cracker and I had it all
to ourselves, and uncommonly good it was.It's a pity for people to be
so prejudiced."The good hermit was choking a little himself, for some reason or other,
but he looked very grave when Bruin turned toward him for assent, and
said, "Quite so!"The broth being now ready, the bear proceeded to arrange a tray neatly,
and set it before his patient, who took up his wooden spoon and fell to
with right good-will.The good bear stood watching him with great
satisfaction; and it was really a pity that there was no one there to
watch the bear himself, for as he stood there with a clean cloth over
his arm, his head on one side, and his honest face beaming with pride
and pleasure, he was very well worth looking at.At this moment a sharp cry of terror was heard outside, then a quick
whirr of wings, and the next moment the wood-pigeon darted into the
cave, closely pursued by a large hawk.She was quite
exhausted, and with one more piteous cry she fell fainting at Bruin's
feet.In another instant the hawk would have pounced upon her, but that
instant never came for the winged marauder.Instead, something or
somebody pounced on _him_.A thick white covering enveloped him,
entangling his claws, binding down his wings, well-nigh stifling him.He
felt himself seized in an iron grasp and lifted bodily into the air,
while a deep, stern voice exclaimed,--

"Now, sir!have you anything to say for yourself, before I wring your
neck?"Then the covering was drawn back from his head, and he found himself
face to face with the great bear, whom he knew perfectly well by sight.But he was a bold fellow, too well used to danger to shrink from it,
even in so terrible a form as this; and his fierce yellow eyes met the
stern gaze of his captor without shrinking.repeated the bear, "before I wring your ugly
neck?"replied the hawk, sullenly, "wring away."This answer rather disconcerted our friend Bruin, who, as he sometimes
said sadly to himself, had "lost all taste for killing;" so he only
shook Master Hawk a little, and said,--

"Do you know of any reason why your neck should _not_ be wrung?"Are you
afraid, you great clumsy monster?""I'll soon show you whether I am afraid or not!""If _you_ had had
nothing to eat for a week, you'd have eaten her long before this, I'll
be bound!"Here Bruin began to rub his nose with his disengaged paw, and to look
helplessly about him, as he always did when disturbed in mind.he exclaimed, "you hawk, what do you mean by that?"It _is_ rather short," said Bruin; "but--yes!why, of course, _any one_
can dig, if he wants to.""Ask that old thing," said the hawk, nodding toward the hermit, "whether
_he_ ever dug with his beak; and it's twice as long as mine."replied Bruin, promptly; but then he faltered, for
it suddenly occurred to him that he had never seen either Toto or the
Madam dig with their noses; and it was with some hesitation that he
asked:

"Mr.but--a--have you ever tried digging for roots
in the ground--with your beak--I mean, nose?"The hermit looked up gravely, as he sat with Pigeon Pretty on his knee."No, my friend," he said with great seriousness, "I have never tried
it, and doubt if I could do it.I can dig with my hands, though," he
added, seeing the good bear look more and more puzzled."But you see this bird has no hands, though he
has very ugly claws; so that doesn't help-- Well!"he cried, breaking
off short, and once more addressing the hawk."I don't see anything for
it _but_ to wring your neck, do you?After all, it will keep you from
being hungry again."But here the soft voice of the wood-pigeon interposed.Bruin,
dear," cried the gentle bird."Give him something to eat, and let him
go.If he had eaten nothing for a week, I am sure he was not to blame
for pursuing the first eatable creature he saw.Remember," she added in
a lower tone, which only the bear could hear, "that before this winter,
any of us would have done the same."Bruin scratched his head helplessly; the hawk turned his yellow eyes on
Pigeon Pretty with a strange look, but said nothing.But now the hermit
saw that it was time for him to interfere."Pigeon Pretty," he said, "you are right, as usual.Bruin, my friend,
bring your prisoner here, and let him finish this excellent broth, into
which I have crumbled some bread.I will answer for Master Hawk's good
behavior, for the present at least," he added, "for I know that he comes
of an old and honorable family."In five minutes the hawk was sitting quietly on the
hermit's knee, sipping broth, pursuing the floating bits of bread in the
bowl, and submitting to have his soft black plumage stroked, with the
best grace in the world.On the good man's other knee sat Pigeon Pretty,
now quite recovered from her fright and fatigue, her soft eyes beaming
with pleasure; while Bruin squatted opposite them, looking from one to
the other, and assuring himself over and over again that Pigeon Pretty
was "a most astonishing bird!'pon my word, a _most_ astonishing bird!"His meal ended, the stranger wiped his beak politely on his feathers,
plumed himself, and thanked his hosts for their hospitality, with a
stately courtesy which contrasted strangely with his former sullen and
ferocious bearing.The fierce glare was gone from his eyes, which were,
however, still strangely bright; and with his glossy plumage smooth, and
his head held proudly erect, he really was a noble-looking bird."Long is it, indeed," he said, "since any one has spoken a kind word to
Ger-Falcon.It will not be forgotten, I assure you.We are a wild and
lawless family,--our beak against every one, and every one's claw
against us,--and yet, as you observed, Sir Baldhead, we are an old and
honorable race.for the brave, brave days of old, when my sires
were the honored companions of kings and princes!My grandfather seventy
times removed was served by an emperor, the obsequious monarch carrying
him every day on his own wrist to the hunting.He ate from a golden
dish, and wore a collar of gems about his neck.what would be
the feelings of that noble ancestor if he could see his descendant a
hunted outlaw, persecuted by the sons of those very men who once courted
and caressed him, and supporting a precarious existence by the ignoble
spoils of barn-yards and hen-roosts!"The hawk paused, overcome by these recollections of past glory, and the
good bear said kindly,--

"Dear!And how did this melancholy change come
about, pray?"replied the hawk, "ignoble fashion!The race of
men degenerated, and occupied themselves with less lofty sports than
hawking.My family, left to themselves, knew not what to do.They had
been trained to pursue, to overtake, to slay, through long generations;
they were unfitted for anything else.But when they began to lead this
life on their own account, man, always ungrateful, turned upon them, and
persecuted them for the very deeds which had once been the delight and
pride of his fickle race.So we fell from our high estate, lower and
lower, till the present representative of the Ger-Falcon is the poor
creature you behold before you."The hawk bowed in proud humility, and his hearers all felt, perhaps,
much more sorry for him than he deserved.The wood-pigeon was about to
ask something more about his famous ancestors, when a shadow darkened
the mouth of the cave, and Toto made his appearance, with the crow
perched on his shoulder.he cried in his fresh, cheery voice, "how are you
to-day, sir?And catching sight of the stranger, he stopped short, and looked at the
bear for an explanation.Ger-Falcon, Toto," said Bruin.Toto nodded, and the hawk made him a stately bow; but the two
looked distrustfully at each other, and neither seemed inclined to make
any advances.Bruin continued,--

"Mr.Falcon came here in a--well, not in a friendly way at all, I must
say.But he is in a very different frame of mind, now, and I trust there
will be no further trouble.""Do you ever change your name, sir?"asked Toto, abruptly, addressing
the hawk."I have
no reason to be ashamed of my name.""And yet I am tolerably sure that Mr.Ger-Falcon is no other than Mr.Chicken Hawkon, and that it was he who
tried to carry off my Black Spanish chickens yesterday morning."I was
starving, and the chickens presented themselves to me wholly in the
light of food.May I ask for what purpose you keep chickens, sir?""Why, we eat them when they grow up," said Toto; "but--"

"Ah, precisely!""But we don't steal other people's chickens," said the boy, "we eat our
own.""You eat the tame, confiding
creatures who feed from your hand, and stretch their necks trustfully to
meet their doom.I, on the contrary, when the pangs of hunger force me
to snatch a morsel of food to save me from starvation, snatch it from
strangers, not from my friends."Toto was about to make a hasty reply, but the bear, with a motion of his
paw, checked him, and said gravely to the hawk,--

"Come, come!Falcon, I cannot have any dispute of this kind.There
is some truth in what you say, and I have no doubt that emperors and
other disreputable people have had a large share in forming the bad
habits into which you and all your family have fallen.But those habits
must be changed, sir, if you intend to remain in this forest.You must
not meddle with Toto's chickens; you must not chase quiet and harmless
birds.You must, in short, become a respectable and law-abiding bird,
instead of a robber and a murderer.""But how am I to live, pray?I
can be'respectable,' as you call it, in summer; but in weather like
this--"

"That can be easily managed," said the kind hermit."You can stay with
me, Falcon.I shall soon be able to shift for myself, and I will gladly
undertake to feed you until the snow and frost are gone.You will be a
companion for my crow-- By the way, where is my crow?Surely he came in
with you, Toto?""He did," said Toto, "but he hopped off the moment we entered.Didn't
like the looks of the visitor, I fancy," he added in a low tone.Search was made, and finally the crow was discovered huddled together, a
disconsolate little bunch of black feathers, in the darkest corner of
the cave.cried Toto, who was the first to catch sight of him.Why are you rumpling and humping yourself up in that
absurd fashion?"asked the crow, opening one eye a very little way, and
lifting his head a fraction of an inch from the mass of feathers in
which it was buried."Good Toto, kind Toto, is he gone?I would not be
eaten to-day, Toto, if it could be avoided."If you mean the hawk," said Toto, "he is _not_ gone; and what is more,
he isn't going, for your master has asked him to stay the rest of the
winter.Bruin has bound him
over to keep the peace, and you must come out and make the best of it."The unhappy crow begged and protested, but all in vain.Toto caught him
up, laughing, and carried him to his master, who set him on his knee,
and smoothed his rumpled plumage kindly.The hawk, who was highly
gratified by the hermit's invitation, put on his most gracious manner,
and soon convinced the crow that he meant him no harm."A member of the ancient family of Corvus!""Contemporaries, and probably friends, of the early Falcons.Let us also
be friends, dear sir; and let the names of James Crow and Ger-Falcon go
down together to posterity."But now Bruin and Pigeon Pretty were eager to hear all the home news
from the cottage.They listened with breathless interest to Toto's
account of the attempted robbery, and of <DW53>'s noble "defence of the
castle," as the boy called it.Miss Mary also received her full share of
the credit, nor was the kettle excluded from honorable mention.When all
was told, Toto proceeded to unpack the basket he had brought, which
contained gingerbread, eggs, apples, and a large can of butter-milk
marked "For Bruin."Many were the joyous exclamations called forth by
this present of good cheer; and it seemed as if the old hermit could not
sufficiently express his gratitude to Toto and his good grandmother.cried the boy, half distressed by the oft-repeated thanks."If you only knew how we _like_ it!Besides,"
he added, "I want you to do something for _me_ now, Mr.Baldhead, so
that will turn the tables.A shower is coming up, and it is early yet,
so I need not go home for an hour.So, will you not tell us a story?We
are very fond of stories,--Bruin and Pigeon Pretty and I.""With all my heart, dear
lad!"I have not heard a fairy story
for a long time."said the hermit, after a moment's reflection."When I was a
boy like you, Toto, I lived in Ireland, the very home of the fairy-folk;
so I know more about them than most people, perhaps, and this is an
Irish fairy story that I am going to tell you."And settling himself comfortably on his moss-pillows, the hermit began
the story of--




CHAPTER XIII."'It's Green Men, it's Green Men,
        All in the wood together;
      And, oh!we're feared o' the Green Men
        In all the sweet May weather,'--


"ON'Y I'm _not_ feared o' thim mesilf!"said Eileen, breaking off her
song with a little merry laugh."Wouldn't I be plazed to meet wan o'
thim this day, in the wud!Sure, it 'ud be the lookiest day o' me
loife."She parted the boughs, and entered the deep wood, where she was to
gather <DW19>s for her mother.Holding up her blue apron carefully, the
little girl stepped lightly here and there, picking up the dry brown
sticks, and talking to herself all the while,--to keep herself company,
as she thought."Thin I makes a low curchy," she was saying, "loike that wan Mother made
to the lord's lady yistherday, and the Green Man he gi'es me a nod,
and--

"'What's yer name, me dear?'"'Eileen Macarthy, yer Honor's Riverence!'I mustn't say
'Riverence,' bekase he's not a priest, ava'.'Yer Honor's Grace' wud do
better."'And what wud ye loike for a prisint, Eily?'"And thin I'd say--lit me see!A big green grasshopper, caught be his leg
in a spider's wib.Wait a bit, poor crathur, oi'll lit ye free agin."Full of pity for the poor grasshopper, Eily stooped to lift it carefully
out of the treacherous net into which it had fallen.But what was her
amazement on perceiving that the creature was not a grasshopper, but a
tiny man, clad from head to foot in light green, and with a scarlet cap
on his head.The little fellow was hopelessly entangled in the net, from
which he made desperate efforts to free himself, but the silken strands
were quite strong enough to hold him prisoner.For a moment Eileen stood petrified with amazement, murmuring to
herself, "Howly Saint Bridget!Sure, I niver
thought I'd find wan really in loife!"but the next moment her kindness
of heart triumphed over her fear, and stooping once more she very gently
took the little man up between her thumb and finger, pulled away the
clinging web, and set him respectfully on the top of a large toadstool
which stood conveniently near.The little Green Man shook himself, dusted his jacket with his red cap,
and then looked up at Eileen with twinkling eyes."Ye have saved my life, and ye
shall not be the worse for it, if ye _did_ take me for a grasshopper."Eily was rather abashed at this, but the little man looked very kind; so
she plucked up her courage, and when he asked, "What is yer name, my
dear?"("jist for all the wurrld the way I thought of," she said to
herself) answered bravely, with a low courtesy, "Eileen Macarthy, yer
Honor's Riverence--Grace, I mane!"and then she added, "They calls me
Eily, most times, at home.""Well, Eily," said the Green Man, "I suppose ye know who I am?""A fairy, plaze yer Honor's Grace!""Sure, I've aften heerd av yer Honor's people, but I niver thought I'd
see wan of yez.It's rale plazed I am, sure enough.Manny's the time
Docthor O'Shaughnessy's tell't me there was no sich thing as yez; but I
niver belaved him, yer Honor!"said the Green Man, heartily, "that's very right.And now, Eily, alanna, I'm going to do ye a
fairy's turn before I go.Ye shall have yer wish of whatever ye like in
the world.Take a minute to think about it, and then make up yer mind."Her dreams had then come true; she was to
have a fairy wish!Eily had all the old fairy-stories at her tongue's end, for her
mother told her one every night as she sat at her spinning.Jack and the
Beanstalk, the Sleeping Beauty, the Seven Swans, the Elves that stole
Barney Maguire, the Brown Witch, and the Widdy Malone's Pig,--she knew
them all, and scores of others besides.Her mother always began the
stories with, "Wanst upon a time, and a very good time it was;" or,
"Long, long ago, whin King O'Toole was young, and the praties grew all
ready biled in the ground;" or, "Wan fine time, whin the fairies danced,
and not a poor man lived in Ireland."In this way, the fairies seemed
always to be thrown far back into a remote past, which had nothing in
common with the real work-a-day world in which Eily lived.But now--oh,
wonder of wonders!--now, here was a real fairy, alive and active, with
as full power of blessing or banning as if the days of King O'Toole had
come again,--and what was more, with good-will to grant to Eileen
Macarthy whatever in the wide world she might wish for!The child stood
quite still, with her hands clasped, thinking harder than she had ever
thought in all her life before; and the Green Man sat on the toadstool
and watched her, with eyes which twinkled with some amusement, but no
malice."Take yer time, my dear," he said, "take yer time!Ye'll not meet a
Green Man every day, so make the best o' your chance!"Suddenly Eily's face lighted up with a sudden inspiration.she
cried, "sure I have it, yer Riverence's Grace--Honor, I shud say!it's the di'monds and pearrls I'll have, iv ye plaze!"repeated the fairy, "what diamonds and pearls?You don't want them _all_, surely?""Och, no, yer Honor!""Only wan of aich to dhrop out o' me
mouth ivery time I shpake, loike the girrl in the sthory, ye know.Whiniver she opened her lips to shpake, a di'mond an' a pearrl o' the
richest beauty dhropped from her mouth.That's what I mane, plaze yer
Honor's Grace.wudn't it be beautiful, entirely?""Are ye _quite_ sure that
this is what you wish for most, Eileen?Don't decide hastily, or ye may
be sorry for it."cried Eileen, "what for wud I be sorry?Sure I'd be richer than
the Countess o' Kilmoggen hersilf, let alone the Queen, be the time I'd
talked for an hour.An' I _loove_ to talk!"she added softly, half to
herself."Well, Eily," he said, "ye shall
have yer own way.Eileen bent down, and he touched her lips three times with the scarlet
tassel of his cap.Now go home, Eileen Macarthy, and the good wishes of the Green Men go
with ye.Ye will have yer own wish fulfilled as soon as ye cross the
threshold of yer home."A day
may come when ye will wish with all yer heart to have the charm taken
away.If that ever happens, come to this same place with a sprig of
holly in yer hand.Strike this toadstool three times, and say,
'Slanegher Banegher, Skeen na Lane!'and
clapping his scarlet cap on his head, the little man leaped from the
toadstool, and instantly disappeared from sight among the ferns and
mosses.Eileen stood still for some time, lost in a dream of wonder and delight.Finally rousing herself, she gave a long, happy sigh, and hastily
filling her apron with sticks, turned her steps homeward.The sun was sinking low when she came in sight of the little cabin, at
the door of which her mother was standing, looking anxiously in every
direction."Is it yersilf, Eily?"cried the good woman in a tone of relief, as she
saw the child approaching.It's a wild
colleen y'are, to be sprankin' about o' this way, and it nearly sundown.Where have ye been, I'm askin' ye?"Eily held up her apronful of sticks with a beaming smile, but answered
never a word till she stood on the threshold of the cottage.("Sure I
might lose some," she had been saying to herself, "and that 'ud niver
do.")But as soon as she had entered the little room which was kitchen,
hall, dining-room, and drawing-room for the Macarthy family, she dropped
her bundle of <DW19>s, and clasping her hands together, cried, "Och,
mother!Sure ye'll niver belave me whin I till ye--"

Here she suddenly stopped, for hop!two round shining things
dropped from her mouth, and rolled away over the floor of the cabin.[marbles]" shouted little Phelim, jumping up from his
seat by the fire and running to pick up the shining objects."Eily's
got her mouf full o' marvels!"Wait till I till ye,
mother asthore!I wint to the forest as ye bade me, to gather shticks,
an'--" hop!out flew two more shining things from her mouth and
rolled away after the others.Macarthy uttered a piercing shriek, and clapped her hand over
Eileen's mouth."Me choild's bewitched,
an' shpakin' buttons!Run,
Phelim," she added, "an' call yer father.He's in the praty-patch,
loikely.she said to Eily, who was struggling
vainly to free herself from her mother's powerful grasp."Kape shtill,
I'm tillin' ye, an' don't open yer lips!It's savin' yer body an' sowl I
may be this minute.Saint Bridget, Saint Michael, an' blissid Saint
Patrick!"she ejaculated piously, "save me choild, an' I'll serve ye on
me knees the rist o' me days."This was a sad beginning of all her glory.She tried
desperately to open her mouth, sure that in a moment she could make her
mother understand the whole matter.But Honor Macarthy was a stalwart
woman, and Eily's slender fingers could not stir the massive hand which
was pressed firmly upon her lips.At this moment her father entered hastily, with Phelim panting behind
him."Phwhat's the matther, woman?""Here's Phelim clane
out o' his head, an' shcramin' about Eily, an' marvels an' buttons, an'
I dunno what all.he added in a tone of great
alarm, as he saw Eileen in her mother's arms, flushed and disordered,
the tears rolling down her cheeks.cried Honor, "it's bewitched she is,--clane bewitched out
o' her sinses, an shpakes buttons out av her mouth wid ivery worrd she
siz.Who wud do ye sich an
ill turn as this, whin ye niver harmed annybody since the day ye were
born?""_Buttons!_" said Dennis Macarthy; "what do ye mane by buttons?How can
she shpake buttons, I'm askin' ye?Sure, ye're foolish yersilf, Honor,
woman!Lit the colleen go, an' she'll till me phwhat 'tis all about.""Och, av ye don't belave me!""Show thim to yer father,
Phelim!Look at two av thim there in the corner,--the dirrty things!"Phelim took up the two shining objects cautiously in the corner of his
pinafore and carried them to his father, who examined them long and
carefully.Finally he spoke, but in an altered voice."Lit the choild go, Honor," he said."I want to shpake till her.he added sternly; and very reluctantly his wife released poor
Eily, who stood pale and trembling, eager to explain, and yet afraid to
speak for fear of being again forcibly silenced."Eileen," said her father, "'tis plain to be seen that these things are
not buttons, but jew'ls."said Dennis; "jew'ls, or gims, whichiver ye plaze to call thim.Now, phwhat I want to know is, where did ye get thim?"cried Eily; "don't look at me that a-way!Sure, I've done
no harrum!another splendid diamond and another
white, glistening pearl fell from her lips; but she hurried on, speaking
as quickly as she could: "I wint to the forest to gather shticks, and
there I saw a little Grane Man, all the same loike a hoppergrass, caught
be his lig in a spidher's wib; and whin I lit him free he gi' me a wish,
to have whativer I loiked bist in the wurrld; an' so I wished, an' I
sid--" but by this time the pearls and diamonds were hopping like
hail-stones all over the cabin-floor; and with a look of deep anger and
sorrow Dennis Macarthy motioned to his wife to close Eileen's mouth
again, which she eagerly did."To think," he said, "as iver a child o' mine shud shtale the Countess's
jew'ls, an' thin till me a pack o' lies about thim!Honor, thim is the
beads o' the Countess's nickluss that I was tillin' ye about, that I saw
on her nick at the ball, whin I carried the washin' oop to the Castle.An' this misfortunate colleen has shwallied 'em.""How wud she shwally 'em,
an' have 'em in her mouth all the toime?An' how wud she get thim to
shwally, an' the Countess in Dublin these three weeks, an' her jew'ls
wid her?Shame an ye, Dinnis Macarthy!to suspict yer poor, diminted
choild of shtalin'!It's bewitched she is, I till ye!Look at the face
av her this minute!"Just at that moment the sound of wheels was heard; and Phelim, who was
standing at the open door, exclaimed,--

"Father!here's Docthor O'Shaughnessy dhrivin' past.cried both mother and father in a
breath.Phelim darted out, and soon returned, followed by the doctor,--a tall,
thin man with a great hooked nose, on which was perched a pair of green
spectacles.O'Shaughnessy; and now a cold shiver passed
over her as he fixed his spectacled eyes on her and listened in silence
to the confused accounts which her father and mother poured into his
ear.Let me see the jew'ls, as ye call thim."The pearls and diamonds were brought,--a whole handful of them,--and
poured into the doctor's hand, which closed suddenly over them, while
his dull black eyes shot out a quick gleam under the shading spectacles.The next moment, however, he laughed good-humoredly and turned them
carelessly over one by one."Why, Dinnis," he said, "'tis aisy to see that ye've not had mich
expeerunce o' jew'ls, me bye, or ye'd not mistake these bits o' glass
an' sich fer thim.there's no jew'ls here, wheriver the
Countess's are.An' these bits o' trash dhrop out o' the choild's mouth,
ye till me, ivery toime she shpakes?""Ivery toime, yer Anner!""Out they dhrops, an' goes hoppin'
an' leppin' about the room, loike they were aloive."This is a very sirrious case,
Misther Macarthy,--a very sirrious case _in_dade, sirr; an' I'll be free
to till ye that I know but _wan_ way av curin' it.""Och, whirrasthru!""What is it at all, Docthor
alanna?Is it a witch has overlooked her, or what is it?will I lose ye this-a-way?and in her grief she loosed her hold of Eileen and clapped her hands to
her own face, sobbing aloud.But before the child could open her lips to
speak, she found herself seized in another and no less powerful grasp,
while another hand covered her mouth,--not warm and firm like her
mother's, but cold, bony, and frog-like.Holding her as in a vice, Dr.O'Shaughnessy spoke once more to her parents."I'll save her loife," said he, "and mebbe her wits as well, av the
thing's poassible.But it's not here I can do ut at all.I'll take the
choild home wid me to me house, and Misthress O'Shaughnessy will tind
her as if she wuz her own; and thin I will try th' ixpirimint which is
the ownly thing on airth can save her.""Sure, there's two, three kinds o' mint growin'
here in oor own door-yard, but I dunno av there's anny o' that kind.Will ye make a tay av it, Docthor, or is it a poultuss ye'll be puttin'
an her, to dhraw out the witchcraft, loike?""Whisht, whisht, woman!""Howld yer prate,
can't ye, an' the docthor waitin'?Is there no way ye cud cure her, an'
lave her at home thin, Docthor?Faith, I'd be loth to lave her go away
from uz loike this, let alone the throuble she'll be to yez!""At laste," he added
more gravely, "naw moor thin I'd gladly take for ye an' yer good woman,
Dinnis!Come, help me wid the colleen, now.Now, thin, oop
wid ye, Eily!"And the next moment Eileen found herself in the doctor's narrow gig,
wedged tightly between him and the side of the vehicle."Ye can sind her bits o' clothes over by Phelim," said Dr.O'Shaughnessy, as he gathered up the reins, apparently in great haste.Good-day t' ye, Dinnis!My respicts to ye,
Misthress Macarthy.Ye'll hear av the choild in a day or two!"And
whistling to his old pony, they started off at as brisk a trot as the
latter could produce on such short notice.Was this the result of the fairy's gift?She sat still,
half-paralyzed with grief and terror, for she made no doubt that the
hated doctor was going to do something very, very dreadful to her.Seeing that she made no effort to free herself, or to speak, her captor
removed his hand from her mouth; but not until they were well out of
sight and hearing of her parents."Now, Eileen," he said, not unkindly, "av ye'll be a good colleen, and
not shpake a wurrd, I'll lave yer mouth free.But av ye shpake, so much
as to say, 'Bliss ye!'I'll tie up yer jaw wid me pock'-handkercher, so
as ye can't open ut at all.She had not the slightest desire to say "Bliss
ye!"O'Shaughnessy; nor did she care to fill his rusty old gig,
or to sprinkle the high road, with diamonds and pearls.said the Doctor, "that's a sinsible gyurrl as ye are.See, now, what a foine bit o' sweet-cake Misthress O'Shaughnessy 'ull be
givin' ye, whin we git home."The poor child burst into tears, for the word 'home' made her realize
more fully that she was going every moment farther and farther away from
her own home,--from her kind father, her anxious and loving mother, and
dear little Phelim.What would Phelim do at night, without her shoulder
to curl up on and go to sleep, in the trundle-bed which they had shared
ever since he was a tiny baby?Who would light her father's pipe, and
sing him the little song he always liked to hear while he smoked it
after supper?These, and many other such thoughts, filled Eileen's mind
as she sat weeping silently beside the green-spectacled doctor, who
cared nothing about her crying, so long as she did not try to speak.After a drive of some miles, they reached a tall, dark, gloomy-looking
house, which was not unlike the doctor himself, with its small greenish
window-panes and its gaunt chimneys.Here the pony stopped, and the
doctor, lifting Eileen out of the gig, carried her into the house.O'Shaughnessy came out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron,
and stared in amazement at the burden in her husband's arms.Is she
kilt, or what's the matther?""Open the door o' the best room!""Open it,
woman, I'm tillin' ye!"and entering a large bare room, he set Eileen
down hastily on a stool, and then drew a long breath and wiped his brow."Safe and sound I've got ye now, glory for ut!And ye'll not lave this room until ye've made me _King av Ireland_!"Eileen stared at the man, thinking he had gone mad; for his face was
red, and his eyes, from which he had snatched the green spectacles,
glittered with a strange light.The same idea flashed into his wife's
mind, and she crossed herself devoutly, exclaiming,--

"Howly St.Pathrick, he's clane diminted.he said; "ye'll soon see
av I'm diminted.I till ye I'll be King av Ireland before the month's
oot.Open yer mouth, alanna, and make yer manners
to Misthress O'Shaughnessy."Thus adjured, Eileen dropped a courtesy, and said, timidly, "Good day t'
ye, Ma'm!down dropped a pearl and a diamond, and the doctor, pouncing
on them, held them up in triumph before the eyes of his astonished wife.There's no sich in Queen
Victory's crownd this day.That's a pearrl, an' as big
as a marrowfat pay.The loike of ut's not in Ireland, I till ye.Woman,
there's a fortin' in ivery wurrd this colleen shpakes!And she's goin'
to shpake," he added, grimly, "and to kape an shpakin', till Michael
O'Shaughnessy is rich enough to buy all Ireland,--ay, and England too,
av he'd a mind to!"O'Shaughnessy, utterly bewildered by her
husband's wild talk, and by the sight of the jewels, "what does it all
mane?And won't she die av 'em, av it's
that manny in her stumick?""Whisht wid yer foolery!""Swallied
'em, indade!The gyurrl has met a Grane Man, that's the truth of ut; and
he's gi'n her a wish, and she's got ut,--and now I've got _her_."And he
chuckled, and rubbed his bony hands together, while his eyes twinkled
with greed."Sure, ye always till't me there was no sich thing ava'.""I lied, an' that's all there is to
say about ut.Do ye think I'm obleeged to shpake the thruth ivery day in
the week to an ignor'nt crathur like yersilf?It's worn out I'd be, body
and sowl, at that rate.Now, Eileen Macarthy," he continued, turning to
his unhappy little prisoner, "ye are to do as I till ye, an' no
harrum'll coom to ye, an' maybe good.Ye are to sit in this room and
_talk_; and ye'll kape an talkin' till the room is _full-up_!"No less'll satisfy me, and it's the
laste ye can do for all the throuble I've taken forr ye.Misthress
O'Shaughnessy an' mesilf 'ull take turns sittin' wid ye, so 'at ye'll
have some wan to talk to.Ye'll have plinty to ate an' to dhrink, an'
that's more than manny people have in Ireland this day.With this, the worthy man proceeded to give strict injunctions to his
wife to keep the child talking, and not to leave her alone for an
instant; and finally he departed, shutting the door behind him, and
leaving the captive and her jailer alone together.O'Shaughnessy immediately poured forth a flood of questions, to
which Eileen replied by telling the whole pitiful story from beginning
to end.It was a relief to be able to speak at last, and to rehearse the
whole matter to understanding, if not sympathetic, ears.O'Shaughnessy listened and looked, looked and listened, with open mouth
and staring eyes.With her eyes shut, she would not have believed her
ears; but the double evidence was too much for her.The diamonds and pearls kept on falling, falling, fast and faster.They
filled Eileen's lap, they skipped away over the floor, while the
doctor's wife pursued them with frantic eagerness.Each diamond was
clear and radiant as a drop of dew, each pearl lustrous and perfect; but
they gave no pleasure now to the fairy-gifted child.She could only
think of the task that lay before her,--to FILL this great, empty room;
of the millions and millions, and yet again millions of gems that must
fall from her lips before the floor would be covered even a few inches
deep; of the weeks and months,--perhaps the years,--that must elapse
before she would see her parents and Phelim again.She remembered the
words of the fairy: "A day may come when you will wish with all your
heart to have the charm removed."And then, like a flash, came the
recollection of those other words: "When that day comes, come here to
this spot," and do so and so.In fancy, Eileen was transported again to the pleasant green forest; was
looking at the Green Man as he sat on the toadstool, and begging him to
take away this fatal gift, which had already, in one day, brought her so
much misery.Harshly on her reverie broke in the voice of Mrs.O'Shaughnessy, asking,--

"And has yer father sold his pigs yit?"She started, and came back to the doleful world of reality.But even as
she answered the woman's question, she made in her heart a firm
resolve,--somehow or other, _somehow_, she would escape; she would get
out of this hateful house, away from these greedy, grasping people; she
would manage somehow to find her way to the wood, and then--then for
freedom again!Cheered by her own resolution, she answered the woman
composedly, and went into a detailed account of the birth, rearing, and
selling of the pigs, which so fascinated her auditor that she was
surprised, when the recital was over, to find that it was nearly
supper-time.The doctor now entered, and taking his wife's place, began to ply Eily
with questions, each one artfully calculated to bring forth the longest
possible reply:--

"How is it yer mother is related to the Countess's auld housekeeper,
avick; and why is it, that wid sich grand relations she niver got into
the castle at all?""Phwhat was that I h'ard the other day about the looky bargain yer
father--honest man!--made wid the one-eyed peddler from beyant
Inniskeen?"and--

"Is it thrue that yer mother makes all her butther out av skim-milk just
by making the sign of the cross--God bless it!--over the churn?"Although she did not like the doctor, Eily did, as she had said to the
Green Man, "_loove_ to talk;" so she chattered away, explaining and
disclaiming, while the diamonds and pearls flew like hail-stones from
her lips, and her host and jailer sat watching them with looks of greedy
rapture.Eily paused, fairly out of breath, just as Mrs.O'Shaughnessy entered,
bringing her rather scanty supper.There was quite a pile of jewels in
her lap and about her feet, while a good many had rolled to a distance;
but her heart sank within her as she compared the result of three hours'
steady talking with the end to which the rapacious doctor aspired.She was allowed to eat her supper in peace, but no sooner was it
finished than the questioning began again, and it was not until ten
o'clock had struck that the exhausted child was allowed to lay her head
down on the rude bed which Mrs.O'Shaughnessy had hastily made up for
her.The next day was a weary one for poor Eily.From morning till night she
was obliged to talk incessantly, with only a brief space allowed for her
meals.The doctor and his wife mounted guard by turns, each asking
questions, until to the child's fancy they seemed like nothing but
living interrogation points.All day long, no matter what she was
talking about,--the potato-crop, or the black hen that the fox stole, or
Phelim's measles,--her mind was fixed on one idea, that of escaping from
her prison.If only some fortunate chance would call them both out of
the room at once!There was always a
pair of greedy eyes fixed on her, and on the now hated jewels which
dropped in an endless stream from her lips; always a harsh voice in her
ears, rousing her, if she paused for an instant, by new questions as
stupid as they were long.Once, indeed, the child stopped short, and declared that she could not
and would not talk any more; but she was speedily shown the end of a
birch rod, with the hint that the doctor "would be loth to use the likes
av it on Dinnis Macarthy's choild; but her parints had given him charge
to dhrive out the witchcraft be hook or be crook; and av a birch rod
wasn't first cousin to a crook, what was it at all?"and Eily was forced
to find her powers of speech again.By nightfall of this day the room was ankle-deep in pearls and diamonds.A wonderful sight it was, when the moon looked in at the window, and
shone on the lustrous and glittering heaps which Mrs.O'Shaughnessy
piled up with her broom.The woman was fairly frightened at the sight of
so much treasure, and she crossed herself many times as she lay down on
the mat beside Eileen's truckle-bed, muttering to herself, "Michael
knows bist, I suppose; but sorrow o' me if I can feel as if there was a
blissing an it, ava'!"The third day came, and was already half over, when an urgent summons
came for Doctor O'Shaughnessy.One of his richest patrons had fallen
from his horse and broken his leg, and the doctor must come on the
instant.The doctor grumbled and swore, but there was no help for it; so
he departed, after making his wife vow by all the saints in turn, that
she would not leave Eileen's side for an instant until he returned.When Eily heard the rattle of the gig and the sound of the pony's feet,
and knew that the most formidable of her jailers was actually _gone_,
her heart beat so loud for joy that she feared its throbbing would be
heard.Now, at last, a loop-hole seemed to open for her.She had a plan
already in her head, and now there was a chance for her to carry it out.But an Irish girl of ten has shrewdness beyond her years, and no gleam
of expression appeared in Eileen's face as she spoke to Mrs.O'Shaughnessy, who had been standing by the window to watch her
husband's departure, and who now returned to her seat."We'll be missin' the docthor this day, ma'm, won't we?""He's
so agrayable, ain't he, now?"O'Shaughnessy, with something of a sigh."He's rale agrayable, Michael is--whin he wants to be," she added."Yis,
I'll miss um more nor common to-day, for 'tis worn out I am intirely
wid shlapin so little these two nights past.Sure, I _can't_ shlape, wid
thim things a-shparklin' an' a-glowerin' at me the way they do; and now
I'll not get me nap at all this afthernoon, bein' I must shtay here and
kape ye talkin' till the docthor cooms back.Me hid aches, too, mortial
bad!""Arrah, it's too bad, intirely!Will I till ye a little shtory that me grandmother hed for the hidache?""A shtory for the hidache?""What do ye mane by
that, I'm askin' ye?""I dunno roightly how ut is," replied Eily, innocently, "but Granny used
to call this shtory a cure for the hidache, and mebbe ye'd find ut so.An' annyhow it 'ud kape me talkin'," she added meekly, "for 'tis mortial
long."O'Shaughnessy, settling herself more
comfortably in her chair."I loove a long shtory, to be sure.And Eily began as follows, speaking in a clear, low monotone:--

"Wanst upon a toime there lived an owld, owld woman, an' her name was
Moira Magoyle; an' she lived in an owld, owld house, in an owld, owld
lane that lid through an owld, owld wood be the side of an owld, owld
shthrame that flowed through an owld, owld shthrate av an owld, owld
town in an owld, owld county.An' this owld, owld woman, sure enough,
she had an owld, owld cat wid a white nose; an' she had an owld, owld
dog wid a black tail, an' she had an owld, owld hin wid wan eye, an' she
had an owld, owld cock wid wan leg, an' she had--"

Mrs.O'Shaughnessy yawned, and stirred uneasily on her seat."Seems to
me there's moighty little goin' an in this shtory!"she said, taking up
her knitting, which she had dropped in her lap."I'd loike somethin' a
bit more loively, I'm thinkin', av I had me ch'ice."said Eily, with quiet confidence, "ownly wait till I
coom to the parrt about the two robbers an' the keg o' gunpowdther, an'
its loively enough ye'll foind ut.But I must till ut the same way 'at
Granny did, else it 'ull do no good, ava.Well, thin, I was sayin' to
ye, ma'm, this owld woman (Saint Bridget be good to her!)she had an
owld, owld cow, an' she had an owld, owld shape, an' she had an owld,
owld kitchen wid an owld, owld cheer an' an owld, owld table, an' an
owld, owld panthry wid an owld, owld churn, an' an owld, owld sauce-pan,
an' an owld, owld gridiron, an' an owld, owld--"

Mrs.O'Shaughnessy's knitting dropped again, and her head fell forward
on her breast.Eileen's voice grew lower and softer, but still she went
on,--rising at the same time, and moving quietly, stealthily, towards
the door,--

"An' she had an owld, owld kittle, an' she had an owld, owld pot wid an
owld, owld kiver; an' she had an owld, owld jug, an' an owld, owld
platther, an' an owld, owld tay-pot--"

Eily's hand was on the door, her eyes were fixed on the motionless form
of her jailer; her voice went on and on, its soft monotone now
accompanied by another sound,--that of a heavy, regular breathing which
was fast deepening into a snore."An' she had an owld, owld shpoon, an' an owld, owld fork, an' an owld,
owld knife, an' an owld, owld cup, an' an owld, owld bowl, an' an owld,
owld, owld--"

The door is open!Two little feet go speeding down
the long passage, across the empty kitchen, out at the back door, and
away, away!the story is done and the
bird is flown!Surely it was the next thing to flying, the way in which Eily sped
across the meadows, far from the hated scene of her imprisonment.The
bare brown feet seemed scarcely to touch the ground; the brown locks
streamed out on the wind; the little blue apron fluttered wildly, like a
banner of victory.with panting bosom, with parted lips,
with many a backward glance to see if any one were following; on went
the little maid, over field and fell, through moss and through mire,
till at last--oh, happy, blessed sight!--the dark forest rose before
her, and she knew that she was saved.Quite at the other end of the wood lay the spot she was seeking; but she
knew the way well, and on she went, but more carefully now,--parting the
branches so that she broke no living twig, and treading cautiously lest
she should crush the lady fern, which the Green Men love.How beautiful
the ferns were, uncurling their silver-green fronds and spreading their
slender arms abroad!How pleasant,
how kind, how friendly was everything in the sweet green wood!And here at last was the oak-tree, and at the foot of it there stood the
yellow toadstool, looking as if it did not care about anything or
anybody, which in truth it did not: Breathless with haste and eagerness,
Eileen tapped the toadstool three times with a bit of holly, saying
softly, "Slanegher Banegher!there
sat the Green Man, just as if he had been there all the time, fanning
himself with his scarlet cap, and looking at her with a comical twinkle
in his sharp little eyes."Well, Eily," he said, "is it back so soon ye are?Well, well, I'm not
surprised!"Oh, yer Honor's Riverence--Grace, I mane!"cried poor Eily, bursting
into tears, "av ye'll plaze to take it away!Sure it's nearly kilt I am
along av it, an' no plazure or coomfort in ut at all at all!Take it
away, yer Honor, take it away, and I'll bliss ye all me days!"and, with
many sobs, she related the experiences of the past three days.As she
spoke, diamonds and pearls still fell in showers from her lips, and
half-unconsciously she held up her apron to catch them as they fell, so
that by the time she had finished her story she had more than a quart of
splendid gems, each as big as the biggest kind of pea.The Green Man smiled, but not unkindly, at the recital of Eileen's
woes."Faith, it's a hard time ye've had, my maiden, and no mistake!Hold fast the jewels ye have there, for they're the
last ye'll get."He touched her lips with his cap, and said, "Cabbala
ku!Eily drew a long breath of relief, and the fairy added,--

"The truth is, Eily, the times are past for fairy gifts of this kind.Few people believe in the Green Men now at all, and fewer still ever see
them.Why, ye are the first mortal child I've spoken to for a matter of
two hundred years, and I think ye'll be the last I ever speak to.Fairy
gifts are very pretty things in a story, but they're not convenient at
the present time, as ye see for yourself.There's one thing I'd like to
say to ye, however," he added more seriously; "an' ye'll take it as a
little lesson-like, me dear, before we part.Ye asked me for diamonds
and pearls, and I gave them to ye; and now ye've seen the worth of that
kind for yourself.But there's jewels and jewels in the world, and if
ye choose, Eily, ye can still speak pearls and diamonds, and no harm to
yourself or anybody.""Sure, I don't
undershtand yer Honor at all.""Likely not," said the little man, "but it's now I'm telling ye.Every
gentle and loving word ye speak, child, is a pearl; and every kind deed
done to them as needs kindness, is a diamond brighter than all those
shining stones in your apron.Ye'll grow up a rich woman, Eily, with the
treasure ye have there; but it might all as well be frogs and toads, if
with it ye have not the loving heart and the helping hand that will make
a good woman of ye, and happy folk of yer neighbors.And now good-by,
mavourneen, and the blessing of the Green Men go with ye and stay with
ye, yer life long!""Good-by, yer Honor," cried Eily, gratefully."The saints reward yer
Honor's Grace for all yer kindness to a poor silly colleen like me!But,
oh, wan minute, yer Honor!"she cried, as she saw the little man about
to put on his cap."Will Docthor O'Shaughnessy be King av Ireland?Sure
it's the wicked king he'd make, intirely.Don't let him, plaze, yer
Honor!"Have no fears, Eily,
alanna!O'Shaughnessy has come into his kingdom by this time, and I
wish him joy of it."With these words he clapped his scarlet cap on his head, and vanished
like the snuff of a candle.*       *       *       *       *

Now, just about this time Dr.Michael O'Shaughnessy was dismounting from
his gig at his own back door, after a long and weary drive.He thought
little, however, about his bodily fatigue, for his heart was full of joy
and triumph, his mind absorbed in dreams of glory.He could not even
contain his thoughts, but broke out into words, as he unharnessed the
rusty old pony."An' whin I coom to the palace, I'll knock three times wid the knocker;
or maybe there'll be a bell, loike the sheriff's house (bad luck to um!)And the gossoon'll open the dure, and--

"'Phwhat's yer arrind?'"'It's Queen Victory I'm wantin',' says I.'An' ye'll till her King
Michael av Ireland is askin' for her,' I says."Thin whin Victory hears that, she'll coom roonnin' down hersilf, to bid
me welkim; an' she'll take me oop to the best room, an'--

"'Sit down an the throne, King Michael,' says she.'The other cheers
isn't good enough for the loikes of ye,' says she."'Afther ye, ma'm,' says I, moinding me manners."'An' is there annythin' I can du for ye, to-day, King Michael?'says
she, whin we've sat down an the throne."An' I says, loight and aisy loike, all as if I didn't care, 'Nothin' in
loife, ma'm, I'm obleeged to ye, widout ye'd lind me the loan o' yer
Sunday crownd,' says I, 'be way av a patthern,' says I."An' says she--"

But at this moment the royal meditations were rudely broken in upon by a
wild shriek which resounded from the house.The door was flung violently
open, and Mrs.O'Shaughnessy rushed out like a mad woman."The colleen's gone, an' me niver
shtirrin' from her side!Och, wirra, wirra!It must be the
witches has taken her clane up chimley."O'Shaughnessy stood for a moment transfixed, glaring with speechless
rage at the unhappy woman; then rushing suddenly at her, he seized and
shook her till her teeth chattered together.he yelled, beside himself with rage and
disappointment."Ye've fell ashlape, an' laved her shlip out!Sorrow
seize ye, ye're always the black bean in me porridge!"Then flinging her
from him, he cried, "I don't care!I'll be king wid
what's in there now!"He paused before the door of the best room, lately poor Eily's prison,
to draw breath and to collect his thoughts.The door was closed, and
from within--hark!Waking suddenly from her nap, had she
failed to see the girl, who had perhaps been sleeping, too?At all
events the jewels were there, in shining heaps on the floor, as he had
last seen them, with thousands more covering the floor in every
direction,--a king's ransom in half a handful of them.He would be king
yet, even if the girl were gone.Cautiously he opened the door and
looked in, his eyes glistening, his mouth fairly watering at the thought
of all the splendor which would meet his glance.Captive was there none, yet the room was not empty.Jewels were there none, yet the floor was covered; covered with living
creatures,--toads, snakes, newts, all hideous and unclean reptiles that
hop or creep or wriggle.And as the wretched man stared, with open mouth
and glaring eye-balls, oh, horror!they were all hopping, creeping,
wriggling towards the open door,--towards him!With a yell beside which
his wife's had been a whisper, O'Shaughnessy turned and fled; but after
him--through the door, down the passage and out of the house--came
hopping, creeping, wriggling his myriad pursuers.stretch your long legs, and run like a hunted hare
over hill and dale, over moss and moor.They are close behind you; they
are catching at your heels; they come from every side, surrounding you!Fly, King O'Shaughnessy!The Green Men are
hunting you, if you could but know it, in sport and in revenge; and
three times they will chase you round County Kerry, for thrice three
days, till at last they suffer you to drop exhausted in a bog, and
vanish from your sight.Eily went home with her apron full of pearls and diamonds, to
tell her story again, and this time to be believed.And she grew up a
good woman and a rich woman; and she married the young Count of
Kilmoggan, and spoke diamonds and pearls all her life long,--at least
her husband said she did, and he ought to know.cried Toto, springing lightly into the barn, and waving a
basket round his head.Spanish, Dame Clucket, where
are you all?I want all the fresh eggs you can spare, please!directly-now-this-very-moment!"and the boy tossed his basket up in the
air and caught it again, and danced a little dance of pure enjoyment,
while he waited for the hens to answer his summons.Speckle and Dame Clucket, who had been having a quiet chat together
in the mow, peeped cautiously over the billows of hay, and seeing that
Toto was alone, bade him good-morning."I don't know about eggs, to-day, Toto!""I want to
set soon, and I cannot be giving you eggs every day.""Oh, but I haven't had any for two or three days!""And I
_must_ have some to-day.Good old Clucket, dear old Cluckety, give me
some, please!""Well, I never can refuse that boy, somehow!"said Dame Clucket, half to
herself; and Mrs.Speckle agreed with her that it could not be done.Indeed, it would have been hard to say "No!"to Toto at that moment, for
he certainly was very pleasant to look at.The dusty sunbeams came
slanting through the high windows, and fell on his curly head, his
ruddy-brown cheeks, and honest gray eyes; and as the eyes danced, and
the curls danced, and the whole boy danced with the dancing sunbeams,
why, what could two soft-hearted old hens do but meekly lead the way to
where their cherished eggs lay, warm and white, in their fragrant nests
of hay?"And what is to be done with them?"Speckle, as the last egg
disappeared into the basket."We are going to have a party
to-night,--a real party!Baldhead is coming, and Jim Crow, and
Ger-Falcon.And Granny and Bruin are making all sorts of good
things,--I'll bring you out some, if I can, dear old Speckly,--and these
eggs are for a custard, don't you see?""And <DW53> and I are decorating the kitchen," continued he; "and Cracker
is cracking the nuts and polishing the apples; and Pigeon Pretty and
Miss Mary are dusting the ornaments,--so you see we are all very busy
indeed.and off ran boy Toto, with his basket of eggs, leaving the
two old hens to scratch about in the hay, clucking rather sadly over the
memories of their own chickenhood, when they, too, went to parties,
instead of laying eggs for other people's festivities.In the cottage, what a bustle was going on!The grandmother was at her
pastry-board, rolling out paste, measuring and filling and covering, as
quickly and deftly as if she had had two pairs of eyes instead of none
at all.The bear, enveloped in a huge blue-checked apron, sat with a
large mortar between his knees, pounding away at something as if his
life depended on it.On the hearth sat the squirrel, cracking nuts and
piling them up in pretty blue china dishes; and the two birds were
carefully brushing and dusting, each with a pair of dusters which she
always carried about with her,--one pair gray, and the other soft brown.As for Toto and the raccoon, they were here, there, and everywhere, all
in a moment."Now, then, where are those greens?"called the boy, when he had
carefully deposited his basket of eggs in the pantry.replied <DW53>, appearing at the same moment from the
shed, dragging a mass of ground-pine, fragrant fir-boughs, and
alder-twigs with their bright coral-red berries."We will stand these
big boughs in the corners, Toto.The creeping stuff will go over the
looking-glass and round the windows."Yes, that will do very well," said Toto."We shall need steps, though,
to reach so high, and the step-ladder is broken.""Bruin will be the step-ladder.Stand up here,
Bruin, and make yourself useful."The good bear meekly obeyed, and the raccoon, mounting nimbly upon his
shoulders, proceeded to arrange the trailing creepers with much grace
and dexterity."This reminds me of some of our honey-hunts, old fellow!""Do you remember the famous one we had in the
autumn, a little while before we came here?""That was, indeed, a famous hunt!It gave us our whole winter's supply of honey.And we might have got
twice as much more, if it hadn't been for the accident.""Tell us about it," said Toto."I wasn't with you, you know; and then
came the moving, and I forgot to ask you."<DW53>, you see, had discovered this hive in a big oak-tree, hollow
from crotch to ground.He couldn't get at it alone, for the clever bees
had made it some way down inside the trunk, and he couldn't reach far
enough down unless some one held him on the outside.So we went
together, and I stood on my hind tip-toes, and then he climbed up and
stood on my head, and I held his feet while he reached down into the
hole."said the grandmother, "that was very dangerous, Bruin."Well, you see, dear Madam," replied the bear, apologetically, "it was
really the only way.I couldn't stand on <DW53>'s head and have him hold
_my_ feet, you know; and we couldn't give up the honey, the finest crop
of the season.So--"

"Oh, it was all right!""At least, it was at
first.There was such a quantity of honey,--pots and pots of it!--and
all of the very best quality.I took out comb after comb, laying them in
the crotch of the tree for safe-keeping till I was ready to go down.""But where were the bees all the time?"replied the raccoon, "buzzing about and making a
fine fuss.They tried to sting me, of course, but my fur was too much
for them.The only part I feared for was my nose, and that I had covered
with two or three thicknesses of mullein-leaves, tied on with stout
grass.But as ill-luck would have it, they found out Bruin, and began to
buzz about him, too.One flew into his eye, and he let my feet go for an
instant,--just just for the very instant when I was leaning down as far
as I could possibly stretch to reach a particularly fine comb.Up went
my heels, of course, and down went I.""My _dear_ <DW53>!do you mean--"

"I mean _down_, dear Madam!"repeated the raccoon, gravely,--"the very
downest down there was, I assure you.I fell through that hollow tree as
the falling star darts through the ambient heavens.Luckily there was a
soft bed of moss and rotten wood at the bottom, or I might not have had
the happiness of being here at this moment.As it was--"

"As it was," interrupted the bear, "I dragged him out by the tail
through the hole at the bottom.Indeed, he looked like a hive
himself, covered from head to foot with wax and honey, and a cloud of
bees buzzing about him.But he had a huge piece of comb in each paw, and
was gobbling away, eating honey, wax, bees and all, as if nothing had
happened.""Naturally," said the raccoon, "I am of a saving disposition, as you
know, and cannot bear to see anything wasted.It is not generally known
that bees add a slight pungent flavor to the honey, which is very
agreeable.he repeated, throwing his head back, and
screwing up one eye, to contemplate the arrangement he had just
completed."How is that, Toto; pretty, eh?""But, see here, if you keep Bruin there all
day, we shall never get through all we have to do.Jump down, that's a
good fellow, and help me to polish these tankards."When all was ready, as in due time it was, surely it would have been
hard to find a pleasanter looking place than that kitchen.The clean
white walls were hung with wreaths and garlands, while the great
fir-boughs in the corners filled the air with their warm, spicy
fragrance.Every bit of metal--brass, copper, or steel--was polished so
that it shone resplendent, giving back the joyous blaze of the crackling
fire in a hundred tiny reflections.The kettle was especially glorious,
and felt the importance of its position keenly."I trust you have no unpleasant feeling about this," it said to the
black soup-kettle."Every one cannot be beautiful, you know.If you are
useful, you should be content with that."Some have the fun, and some have the trouble!""My business is to make soup, and I make it.The table was covered with a snowy cloth, and set with glistening
crockery--white and blue--and clean shining pewter.The great tankard
had been brought out of its cupboard, and polished within an inch of its
life; while the three blue ginger-jars, filled with scarlet
alder-berries, looked down complacently from their station on the
mantelpiece.As for the floor, I cannot give you an idea of the
cleanness of it.When everything else was ready and in place, the bear
had fastened a homemade scrubbing-brush to each of his four feet, and
then executed a sort of furious scrubbing-dance, which fairly made the
house shake; and the result was a shining purity which vied with that
of the linen table-cloth, or the very kettle itself.And you should have seen the good bear, when his toilet was completed!The scrubbing-brushes had been applied to his own shaggy coat as well as
to the floor, and it shone, in its own way, with as much lustre as
anything else; and in his left ear was stuck a red rose, from the
monthly rose-bush which stood in the sunniest window and blossomed all
winter long.It is extremely uncomfortable to have a rose stuck in one's
ear,--you may try it yourself, and see how you like it; but Toto had
stuck it there, and nothing would have induced Bruin to remove it.And
you should have seen our Toto himself, carrying his own roses on his
cheeks, and enough sunshine in his eyes to make a thunder-cloud laugh!And you should have seen the great <DW53>, glorious in scarlet
neck-ribbon, and behind his ear (_not_ in it!<DW53> was not Bruin) a
scarlet feather, the gift of Miss Mary, and very precious.And you
should have seen the little squirrel, attired in his own bushy tail,
and rightly thinking that he needed no other adornment; and the parrot
and the wood-pigeon, both trim and elegant, with their plumage arranged
to the last point of perfection.Last of all, you should have seen the
dear old grandmother, the beloved Madam, with her snowy curls and cap
and kerchief; and the ebony stick which generally lived in a drawer and
silver paper, and only came out on great occasions.How proud Toto was
of his Granny!and how the others all stood around her, gazing with
wondering admiration at her gold-bowed spectacles (for those she usually
wore were of horn) and the large breastpin, with a weeping-willow
displayed upon it, which fastened her kerchief."Made out of your grandfather's tail, did you say, Toto?"said the bear,
in an undertone.cried the boy, half pettishly.Surely you might know by this time that we have no tails.""I beg your pardon,
Toto, boy.You are not really vexed with old Bruin?"Toto rubbed his curly head affectionately against the shaggy black one,
in token of amity, and the bear continued:--

"When Madam was a young grandmother, was she as beautiful as she is
now?""Why, yes, I fancy so," replied Toto."Only she wasn't a grandmother
then, you know."You never were
anything but a boy, were you?"When Granny
was young, she was a girl, you see.""I--do--_not_--believe it!I saw a girl once--many years ago; it squinted, and its hair was frowzy,
and it wore a hideous basket of flowers on its head,--a dreadful
creature!Madam never can have looked like _that_!"At this moment a knock was heard at the door.Toto flew to open it, and
with a beaming face ushered in the old hermit, who entered leaning on
his stick, with his crow perched on one shoulder and the hawk on the
other.What bows and
courtesies, and whisking of tails and flapping of wings!The hermit's
bow in greeting to the old lady was so stately that Master <DW53> was
consumed with a desire to imitate it; and in so doing, he stepped back
against the nose of the tea-kettle and burned himself, which caused him
to retire suddenly under the table with a smothered shriek.And the hawk and the pigeon, the raccoon and the crow,
the hermit and the bear, all shook paws and claws, and vowed that they
were delighted to see each other; and what is more, they really _were_
delighted, which is not always the case when such vows are made.Now, when all had become well acquainted, and every heart was prepared
to be merry, they sat down to supper; and the supper was not one which
was likely to make them less cheerful.For there was chicken and ham,
and, oh, such a mutton-pie!You never saw such a pie; the standing crust
was six inches high, and solid as a castle wall; and on that lay the
upper-crust, as lightly as a butterfly resting on a leaf; while inside
was store of good mutton, and moreover golden eggballs and tender little
onions, and gravy as rich as all the kings of the earth put together.and besides all that there was white bread like snow, and brown
bread as sweet as clover-blossoms, and jam and gingerbread, and apples
and nuts, and pitchers of cream and jugs of buttermilk.Truly, it does
one's heart good to think of such a supper, and I only wish that you and
I had been there to help eat it.However, there was no lack of hungry
mouths, with right good-will to keep their jaws at work, and for a time
there was little conversation around the table, but much joy and comfort
in the good victuals.The good grandmother ate little herself, though she listened with
pleasure to the stirring sound of knives and forks, which told her that
her guests were well and pleasantly employed.Presently the hermit
addressed her, and said:--

"Honored Madam, you will be glad to know that there has been a great
change in the weather during the past week.Truly, I think the spring is
at hand; for the snow is fast melting away, the sun shines with more
than winter's heat, and the air to-day is mild and soft."At these words there was a subdued but evident excitement among the
company.The raccoon and the squirrel exchanged swift and significant
glances; the birds, as if by one unconscious impulse, ruffled their
feathers and plumed themselves a little.But boy Toto's face fell, and
he looked at the bear, who, for his part, scratched his nose and looked
intently at the pattern on his plate."It has been a long, an unusually long, season," continued the hermit,
"though doubtless it has seemed much shorter to you in your cosey
cottage than to me in my lonely cavern.But I have lived the
forest-life long enough to know that some of you, my friends," and he
turned with a smile to the forest-friends, "must be already longing to
hear the first murmur of the greenwood spring, and to note in tree and
shrub the first signs of awakening life."There was a moment of silence, during which the raccoon shifted uneasily
on his seat, and looked about him with restless, gleaming eyes.Suddenly
the silence was broken by a singular noise, which made every one start.It was a long-drawn sound, something between a snort, a squeal, and a
snore; and it came from--where _did_ it come from?"It seemed to come," said the hawk, who sat facing the fire, "from the
wall near the fireplace."At this moment the sound was heard again, louder and more distinct, and
this time it certainly _did_ come from the wall,--or rather from the
cupboard in the wall, near the fireplace.Then came a muffled, scuffling sound, and finally
a shrill peevish voice cried, "Let me out!<DW53>, I
know your tricks; let me out, or I'll tell Bruin this minute!"The bear burst into a volcanic roar of laughter, which made the hermit
start and turn pale in spite of himself, and going to the cupboard he
drew out the unhappy woodchuck, hopelessly entangled in his worsted
covering, from which he had been vainly struggling to free himself.It seemed as they would never have done
laughing; while every moment the woodchuck grew more furious,--squeaking
and barking, and even trying to bite the mighty paw which held him.But
the wood-pigeon had pity on him, and with a few sharp pulls broke the
worsted net, and begged Bruin to set him down on the table.This being
done, Master Chucky found his nose within precisely half an inch of a
most excellent piece of dried beef, upon which he fell without more ado,
and stayed not to draw breath till the plate was polished clean and
dry.That made every one laugh again, and altogether they were very merry,
and fell to playing games and telling stories, leaving the woodchuck to
try the keen edge of his appetite upon every dish on the table.By-and-by, however, this gentleman could eat no more; so he wiped his
paws and whiskers, brushed his coat a little, and then joined in the
sport with right good-will.It was a pleasant sight to see the great bear blindfolded, chasing Toto
and <DW53> from one corner to another, in a grand game of blindman's buff;
it was pleasant to see them playing leap-frog, and spin-the-platter, and
many a good old-fashioned game besides.Then, when these sat down to
rest and recover their breath, what a treat it was to see the four birds
dance a quadrille, to the music of Toto's fiddle!How they fluttered and
sidled, and hopped and bridled!How gracefully Miss Mary courtesied to
the stately hawk; and how jealous the crow was of this rival, who stood
on one leg with such a perfect grace!altogether that was a party worth going to.And when late in the
evening it broke up, and the visitors started on their homeward walk,
all declared it was the merriest time they had yet had together, and all
wished that they might have many more such times.And yet each one knew
in his heart,--and grieved to know,--that it was the last, and that the
end was come.The woodchuck sounded, the next morning, the note
which had for days been vibrating in the hearts of all the wild
creatures, but which they had been loth to strike, for Toto's sake.I don't know what you are all
thinking of, to stay on here after you are awake.I smelt the wet earth
and the water, and the sap running in the trees, even in that dungeon
where you had put me.The young reeds will soon be starting beside the
pool, and it is my work to trim them and thin them out properly;
besides, I am going to dig a new burrow, this year.And the squirrel with a chuckle, and the wood-pigeon with a sigh, and
the raccoon with a strange feeling which he hardly understood, but
which was not all pleasure, echoed the words, "We must be off!"Only the
bear said nothing, for he was in the wood-shed, splitting kindling-wood
with a fury of energy which sent the chips flying as if he were a
saw-mill.So it came to pass that on a soft, bright day in April, when the sun was
shining sweetly, and the wind blew warm from the south, and the buds
were swelling on willow and alder, the party of friends stood around the
door of the little cottage, exchanging farewells, half merry, half sad,
and wholly loving."After all, it is hardly good-by!"Mary journeyed to the hallway."We shall
be here half the time, just as we were last summer; and the other half,
Toto will be in the forest.But Bruin rubbed his nose with his right paw, and said nothing."And you will come to the forest, too, dear Madam!"cried the raccoon,
"will you not?You will bring the knitting and the gingerbread, and we
will have picnics by the pool, and you will learn to love the forest as
much as Toto does.But Bruin rubbed his nose with his left paw, and still said nothing."And when my nest is made, and my little ones are fledged," cooed the
wood-pigeon in her tender voice, "their first flight shall be to you,
dear Madam, and their first song shall tell you that they love you, and
that we love you, every day and all day.For we do love you; don't we,
Bruin?"But the bear only looked helplessly around him, and scratched his head,
and again said nothing."Well," said Toto, cheerily, though with a suspicion of a quiver in his
voice, "you are all jolly good fellows, and we have had a merry winter
together.Of course we shall miss you sadly, Granny and I; but as you
say, Cracker, we shall all see each other every day; and I am longing
for the forest, too, almost as much as you are.""Dear friends," said the blind grandmother, folding her hands upon her
stick, and turning her kindly face from one to the other of the
group,--"dear friends, merry and helpful companions, this has indeed
been a happy season that we have spent together.You have, one and all,
been a comfort and a help to me, and I think you have not been
discontented yourselves; still, the confinement has of course been
strange to you, and we cannot wonder that you pine for your free,
wildwood life.it is a mischievous paw, but it
has never played any tricks on me, and has helped me many and many a
time.My little Cracker, I shall miss your merry chatter as I sit at my
spinning-wheel.Mary, and Pigeon Pretty, let me stroke your soft
feathers once more, by way of 'good-by.'Woodchuck, I have seen little
of you, but I trust you have enjoyed your visit, in your own way."And now, last of all, Bruin!come here and let
me shake your honest, shaggy paw, and thank you for all that you have
done for me and for my boy.""Why, where _is_ Bruin?"cried Toto, starting and looking round; "surely
he was here a minute ago.But no deep voice was heard, roaring cheerfully, "Here, Toto boy!"No
shaggy form came in sight."He has gone on ahead, probably," said the raccoon; "he said something,
this morning, about not liking to say good-by.Come, you others, we must
follow our leader.And with many a backward glance, and many a wave of paw, or tail, or
fluttering wing, the party of friends took their way to the forest home.Boy Toto stood with his hands in his pockets, looking after them with
bright, wide-open eyes.He did not cry,--it was a part of Toto's creed
that boys did not cry after they had left off petticoats,--but he felt
that if he had been a girl, the tears might have come in spite of him.So he stared very hard, and puckered his mouth in a silent whistle, and
felt of the marbles in his pockets,--for that is always a soothing and
comforting thing to do."Toto, dear," said his grandmother, "do you think our Bruin is really
_gone_, without saying a word of farewell to us?"cried the old lady, putting her handkerchief
to her sightless eyes,--"very, very much grieved!If it had been <DW53>,
now, I should not have been so much surprised; but for Bruin, our
faithful friend and helper, to leave us so, seems--"

"_Hello!_" cried Toto, starting suddenly, "what is that noise?"on the quiet air came the sharp crashing sound
of an axe.I'll go--" and with that
he went, as if he had been shot out of a catapult.Rushing into the wood-shed, he caught sight of the well-beloved shaggy
figure, just raising the axe to deliver a fearful blow at an unoffending
log of wood.Flinging his arms round it (the figure, not the axe nor the
log), he gave it such a violent hug that bear and boy sat down suddenly
on the ground, while the axe flew to the other end of the shed.cried Toto, "we thought you were gone, without
saying a word to us.The bear rubbed his nose confusedly, and muttered something about "a few
more sticks in case of cold weather."But here Toto burst out laughing in spite of himself, for the shed was
piled so high with kindling-wood that the bear sat as it were at the
bottom of a pit whose sides of neatly split sticks rose high above his
head."There's kindling-wood enough here to
last us ten years, at the very least.She
thought--"

"There will be more butter to make, now, Toto, since that new calf has
come," said the bear, breaking in with apparent irrelevance."And that pig is getting too big for you to manage," continued Bruin, in
a serious tone."He was impudent to _me_ the other day, and I had to
take him up by the tail and swing him, before he would apologize.Now,
you _couldn't_ take him up by the tail, Toto, much less swing him, and
there is no use in your deceiving yourself about it.""No one could, except you, old
monster.But what _are_ you thinking about that for, now?Granny will think you are gone, after all."And catching the
bear by the ear, he led him back in triumph to the cottage-door, crying,
"Granny, Granny!Now give him a good scolding, please, for
frightening us so."She only stroked the shaggy black
fur, and said, "Bruin, dear!my good, faithful, true-hearted Bruin!I
could not bear to think that you had left me without saying good-by.But you would not have done it, would you,
Bruin?The bear looked about him distractedly, and bit his paw severely, as if
to relieve his feelings."At least, if I meant
to say good-by.I wouldn't say it, because I couldn't.But I don't mean
to say it,--I mean I don't mean to do it.If you don't want me in the
house,--being large and clumsy, as I am well aware, and ugly too,--I can
sleep out by the pump, and come in to do the work.But I cannot leave
the boy, please, dear Madam, nor you.And the calf wants attention, and
that pig _ought_ to be swung at least once a week, and--and--"

But there was no need of further speech, for Toto's arms were clinging
round his neck, and Toto's voice was shouting exclamations of delight;
and the grandmother was shaking his great black paw, and calling him
her best friend, her dearest old Bruin, and telling him that he should
never leave them.And, in fact, he never did leave them.He settled down quietly in the
little cottage, and washed and churned, baked and brewed, milked the cow
and kept the pig in order.Happy was the good bear, and happy was Toto,
in those pleasant days.For every afternoon, when the work was done,
they welcomed one or all of their forest friends; or else they sought
the green, beloved forest themselves, and sat beside the fairy pool, and
wandered in the cool green mazes where all was sweetness and peace, with
rustle of leaves and murmur of water, and chirp of bird and insect.But
evening found them always at the cottage door again, bringing their
woodland joyousness to the blind grandmother, making the kitchen ring
with laughter as they related the last exploits of the raccoon or the
squirrel, or described the courtship of the parrot and the crow.And if you had asked any of the three, as they sat together in the
porch, who was the happiest person in the world, why, Toto and the
Grandmother would each have answered, "I!"But Bruin, who had never
studied grammar, and knew nothing whatever about his nominatives and his
accusatives, would have roared with a thunder-burst of enthusiasm,

Transcriber's Notes:

Obvious punctuation errors repaired.Page 44, illustration caption, "Wah-song!In my
own cases pain was experienced at or near the ileo-caecal valve, where
one was lodged, and along the descending colon, where the others were;
the pain and soreness ceased when these bodies were discharged.In a few instances gall-stones are brought up by vomiting.The most
remarkable example of this is a case to be found in the _Transactions
of the Pathological Society_ (vol.129): A woman ninety-four
years of age vomited a stone the size of a nutmeg.In the reported
examples violent pain, nausea, and much vomiting preceded the discharge
of the calculus.Like other foreign bodies, a gall-stone may ulcerate through the
intestine, producing fatal peritonitis.Many conditions due to the presence of biliary concretions, and which
arise during their migrations, may be viewed as complications.Many of
those produced directly have been described as a part of the proper
course of the malady; others are local and reflex, and these may with
propriety be considered as complications.First in importance are those
due to obstruction and the local inflammation.The passage of a calculus along the duct excites an inflammation of the
mucous membrane, which by contiguity of tissue invades the peritoneal
layer if the stone is retained for a sufficient time, and especially if
it is immovably lodged.The stoppage in the flow of bile leads to
dilatation of the ducts, and a change takes place in the character of
that fluid, {1077} owing to the admixture of mucus with the bile and to
the pouring out of a pathological secretion: it loses the bilious
appearance and becomes a merely sero-purulent fluid.Serious changes
ensue in the structure of the liver, as was first suggested by O. Wyss
and Leyden, and afterward more especially by Wickham Legg[176] and
Charcot.[177] A ligature to the common duct in animals is followed in
so short a time as two weeks by hyperplasia of the connective tissue
and atrophy of the gland-elements.It has been ascertained that similar
changes ensue in man from the impaction of a calculus in the common
duct.Under these circumstances the size of the liver, as indicated by
the area of hepatic dulness, at first enlarges, and subsequently more
or less contraction, coincident with the atrophy, ensues.When the
cystic duct is obstructed the contents of the gall-bladder increase,
and become ultimately sero-purulent (dropsy).In some instances, the
walls of the abdomen being thin, a globular elastic tumor may be felt
projecting from beneath the liver.Bartholomew's Hospital Reports for 1873_.See also
_Treatise on Diseases of the Liver_, by the same author, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 177: _Lecons_.]Angiocholitis, or inflammation of the duct, is caused by the passage,
especially by the impaction, of a calculus.The inflammation may extend
by contiguity of tissue and involve the surrounding parts.Several
cases have been examined by the writer in which the gall-bladder and
the cystic and common duct were imbedded in a mass of organized
exudation.An extension of inflammation may take place, and be confined
to the hepatic peritoneum.Heavy organized exudations will form,
adhesions be contracted to the diaphragm, to the parietal peritoneum,
and to the neighboring organs, and the capsule, thickened and
contracting, will ultimately induce changes in the structure of the
adjacent part of the liver.When the inflammation extends to the
peritoneum there are the usual systemic symptoms, and locally acute
pain, increased by the respiratory movements and by pressure, and
assuming a constrictive character; nausea and frequent vomiting, and
often a very troublesome hiccough, caused, doubtless, by implication of
some branches of the phrenic nerve; constipation, etc.The relation of biliary colic to cancer of the biliary passages was
first noted by Frerichs, who ascertained the occurrence of gall-stones
in 9 out of 11 cases of cancer of these parts.Hilton Fagge[178]
reports a case of the kind, and the writer can add another from his own
observations.The most important of the reflex symptoms are those pertaining to the
circulatory system.The action of the heart becomes irregular in rhythm
and diminishes in force.The circulation of the bile acids in the blood
causes slowing of the heart's action, as has been set forth in the
section on jaundice; but that is a direct consequence, and is not a
reflex impression.Potain was the first to show that the structure of
the heart is affected.A mitral murmur is a recognized symptom in the
icterus of gall-stones, but Potain[179] has shown that the real seat of
this murmur is the tricuspid, and that the affection of the heart is a
dilatation of the right cavities.The physiological reason for this
condition of the heart is the rise of tension in the pulmonary artery,
which is secondary to irritation of the splanchnic nerves; and to this
factor is also due the reduplication of the first sound and the
accentuation of the second sound--characteristic signs of the cardiac
change in these cases.[Footnote 179: Cyr, _Traite de l'Affec.cit._]

{1078} There are certain reflex nervous troubles in cases of hepatic
colic, some of them of great importance.One of the lesser troubles is
herpes zoster.A very violent attack in the course of the distribution
of the first, second, and third cervical nerves has happened in a case
under the writer's observation.There have been reported from time to
time cases of sudden death during the paroxysms of hepatic colic, in
which a calculus lodged in Vater's diverticulum, at the intestinal
extremity of the common duct, was the cause of the accident.An
explanation of this result is to be found in the intimate nervous
communications between the liver and the heart through the solar plexus
and the large number of ganglia contained in Vater's diverticulum.The
most severe pain is felt as the calculus is passing through the orifice
of the common duct into the intestine, and here also the spasm of the
muscular fibre is most tense.The so-called crushing-blow experiment of
Goltz illustrates how intense suffering, such as the passage of a
gall-stone, can paralyze the heart through the solar plexus.The
depression of the heart's action does not always occur on the instant,
but it may be gradual--several hours, even a day or two, being occupied
in the suspension of activity.Leigh of Liverpool[180] has reported an
example of death in six hours in a female of thirty, previously in good
health; Cornillon,[181] another in a female of fifty-three, who died in
twelve hours from the beginning of the paroxysm; Williamson,[182] a
female of fifty-one years, who expired on the fourth day;
Habershon,[183] two, who died during the paroxysms at a period not
stated; and Brouardel, one which was the subject of a medico-legal
investigation.In the first case the calculus was yet in the
gall-bladder, the appearances indicating that persistent spasms had
occurred to force the calculus into the cystic duct; in the others in
which the position of the stone is mentioned, it was engaged in the
orifice of the common duct or had reached the intestine.[Footnote 180: _Medical Times and Gazette_, 1867, vol.[Footnote 182: _The Lancet_ (London), vol.[Footnote 183: _Lectures on the Pneumogastric_, 3d Lecture.]In several instances sudden death has resulted from uncontrollable
vomiting induced by the paroxysms of hepatic colic.Trousseau[184]
mentions a case in which strangulated hernia and death ensued in
consequence of the violent vomiting brought on by the passage of a
calculus.[Footnote 184: _Clinique medicale_.]DIAGNOSIS.--Unless the distension of the gall-bladder is sufficient to
cause a recognizable tumor, gall-stones in that organ do not produce
symptoms by which they can be diagnosticated.If sudden attacks of
violent pain in the right hypochondrium, accompanied by nausea and
vomiting and followed by jaundice, have occurred from time to time,
then the presence of biliary concretions may be suspected if the
symptoms belonging to them are present in the intervals between the
seizures.The migrations of calculi produce symptoms so characteristic
that error is hardly possible.The only disorders with which an attack
of hepatic colic may be confounded are gastralgia and hepatalgia.As
regards the first, the distinction is made by the seat of pain, by the
absence of after jaundice, and by the lack of a concretion passed by
stool.As the diagnosis may depend on the finding a concretion, the
writer must again affirm the importance of a properly-conducted search
of all the stools passed for several days after the paroxysm.{1079} Hepatalgia is diagnosticated with great difficulty, for the pain
has the same seat, the same character, but as a rule it does not
terminate so abruptly, is not accompanied by such severe vomiting and
depression, jaundice is absent, and no stone can be found in the
evacuations.Both gastralgia and hepatalgia occur in the subjects of
neurotic disturbances--in the pale, delicate, and hysterical--whereas,
as a rule, hepatic colic happens to the obese, to the persons of active
digestion addicted to the pleasures of the table.The passage of calculi may be confounded with flatulent colic, with the
pain caused by lead and other mineral poisons, with impaction, internal
strangulation, local peritonitis, and similar causes of sudden and
violent pain.The differentiation is made by attention to the seat and
character of the pain, by the previous history, and especially by the
absence of jaundice and of a concretion.From renal colic the hepatic
is separated by the position of the pain, by the direction taken by it,
and by the retraction of the testicle, the irritability of the bladder,
and the appearance of blood in the urine--all characteristic symptoms
of the renal affection.TREATMENT.--The treatment of biliary concretions includes the remedial
management for the calculi in position, for the paroxysms of hepatic
colic caused by the migration of these bodies, and for the results and
complications.Treatment of the Calculus State: Of Inspissated Bile.--As the particles
of inspissated bile are deposited along the larger hepatic ducts, and
form in consequence of a deficiency in the amount of glycocholate and
taurocholate of soda, two methods of treatment are to be carried out:
free purgation by an active cholagogue to wash out the offending
substance, and the exhibition of a soda salt to promote the alkalinity
of the bile and the consequent solution of the bile-pigment.Harley's
method, which he strongly urges, consists in the administration of "one
or two drachms of sulphate of soda in a bitter infusion every morning
before breakfast, or from twenty to thirty grains of bicarbonate of
soda, along with a drachm of taraxacum-juice in a bitter infusion,
every night at bedtime at regulated intervals for a month or so,
according to the constitution of the patient and the severity of the
symptoms."As persons who suffer from inspissation of the bile are naturally
bilious, it is of the first importance in the prophylactic treatment to
regulate the diet.Indulgence in malt liquors, in fatty and saccharine
articles of food, must be forbidden.Acid fermentation in the course of
duodenal digestion should be prevented by withholding the starches and
sugars.Peptonized foods, given with an alkali, are highly useful.Milk, fresh meat, and the succulent vegetables are the proper
constituents of a diet for these subjects.Bread is one of the most
offending articles, and should be restricted in amount as much as
possible.Next to a suitable diet, systematic exercise is a measure of the
highest utility in these cases.A daily morning sponge bath of a weak
alkaline water not only maintains the skin in a healthy state, but also
promotes the oxidation processes of the body.The alkaline mineral
waters of Wisconsin, Michigan, Virginia, and other States, especially
of the Bethesda Spring of Wisconsin, may be drunk with great advantage
to accomplish the same purpose.{1080} We possess direct means for preventing inspissation of the
bile--remedies which act in the physiological way by increasing the
proportion of glycocholate and taurocholate of soda.Harley prefers the
sulphate and bicarbonate for this purpose, but my experience is in
favor of the cholate and phosphate of sodium, especially the latter;
for, whilst it plays the part of a soda salt, it exerts a decided
cholagogue action, thus effecting the results achieved by the combined
use of sulphate of soda and taraxacum.A cure may be confidently looked
for in this malady by the persistent use of sodium phosphate--drachm j
ter in die.It seems to act more efficiently when given dissolved in
hot water.The paroxysms of hepatic colic due to the passage of inspissated bile
are to be treated in the same way as when this condition of things is
caused by the migration of formed calculi.The action of cholagogue
purgatives is more decidedly beneficial in the attacks due to the
passage of inspissated bile.Biliary Calculi in Situ.--Notwithstanding their crystalline form and
firmness of texture, it is possible to effect the gradual solution of
biliary calculi.Outside of the body it is easy to dissolve a calculus
in chloroform, in Durande's remedy, etc., if time enough be given, but
the problem is a far more difficult one when the calculus is in
position in the gall-bladder or in a hepatic duct.As Trousseau[185]
has wisely observed, it is not safe to apply to conditions within the
body conclusions reached by experiments in the laboratory.Nevertheless, facts are known which justify the belief that an
impression may be made on concretions in the gall-bladder.The motion
of respiration and the voluntary actions of the abdominal muscles cause
more or less attrition and breaking off of the angles and margins of
the crystals, thus permitting the solvent action of the bile.If,
however, the bile continues in the state in which it was at the time of
the crystallization of the cholesterin, it will make no impression on
this substance.We have now the means of restoring its power to
dissolve crystallized cholesterin.As a necessary preliminary, fracture
of the crystals must be effected.This may be accomplished, when the
natural forces have failed to effect it, by manipulation of the
gall-bladder through the walls of the abdomen, but especially by
faradization.Excellent results have been achieved by this
last-mentioned expedient, but no satisfactory explanation has been made
of its methodus medendi, unless we accept the mechanical effect of the
muscular movements.In applying the faradic current an electrode is
introduced into the rectum, and the other, a sponge well moistened, is
placed over the gall-bladder.An interrupted galvanic current is
indicated, the electrodes in the position just mentioned, when a
migrating calculus is stopped on its way.Such an application has
rendered important service in a few cases.[Footnote 185: _Clinique medicale de l'Hotel Dieu de Paris_.]Except that calculi have been found in a state of decay, their angles
and edges broken, divided by cleavage, there is no evidence that they
have undergone solution when in situ, except the clinical evidence
which consists in a disappearance of the symptoms.The remedy of
Durande, which consists in a mixture of ether and turpentine--three
parts of the former and two of the latter--has been celebrated since
the close of the last century, and is yet much employed in France,
notably at Vichy.It {1081} is preferred by Cyr,[186] who advises its
administration in capsules taken immediately before meals.Chloroform
readily dissolves calculi out of the body, and hence it has been
proposed, and indeed much used, for the purpose of effecting their
solution in the gall-bladder; but, as Trousseau urges, there is no
warrant for the belief.Corlieu,[187] who first proposed its use, and
afterward Bouchut,[188] maintained that chloroform does exert this
solvent action, and reported cases in confirmation; but there are so
many sources of fallacy that such evidence must be viewed with
suspicion.It has usually been administered in small doses (five
minims) three times a day for a long period.That it is beneficial by
stimulating the flow of pancreatic secretion and by allaying spasms is
probably true, but that any quantity which can be administered in
safety will act as a solvent of cholesterin concretions cannot be
believed.[Footnote 186: _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, p.[Footnote 187: _Gazette des Hopitaux_, 1856, June 19.][Footnote 188: _Bulletin gen.If solution of hepatic calculi is possible under any circumstances, the
most rational mode of effecting it would seem to be to restore that
condition of the bile which in the normal state maintains cholesterin
in the state of solution.Cholesterin is precipitated and crystallizes
about a nucleus when the glycocholate and taurocholate of soda are
deficient in amount.The agents most effective in restoring the solvent
power of the bile are the salts of soda, of which the sulphate is
preferred by Harley.In 1873 the cholate of soda was brought forward by
Schiff, who prescribed it in doses of 50 centigrammes (8 grains nearly)
three times a day, to be gradually increased until digestive or
circulatory troubles arose.This remedy, which is eminently rational
from the point of view above indicated, has apparently been of decided
service in many published cases and in the writer's experience.It will
be found, however, that five grains three times a day is as large a
quantity as can be easily borne.Another soda salt which in my own hands has proved in a high degree
effective is the phosphate.As has been explained when referring to its
use in cases of disorders due to inspissated bile, it has a distinct
cholagogue action, but the chief sources of its utility in this
affection are its chemical and resolvent powers.The usual quantity is
one drachm three times a day, dissolved in sufficient warm water.Bile itself, in the form of inspissated ox-gall, was formerly much
used, a scruple to a drachm being given three times a day, and not
without good results.It was also prescribed with chloride of ammonium.For the gastro-duodenal catarrh and the accompanying catarrh of the
bile-ducts this combination is sometimes useful.I have recently proposed a new expedient for effecting the solution of
hepatic calculi.This method consists in puncture of the gall-bladder
with a fine exploring-trocar, and the injection through the canula,
after withdrawing the stylet, of a suitable solvent.Durande's remedy,
chloroform, and other solvents can be introduced in this way without
injury to the parts.I have punctured the gall-bladder, removed its
contents, and explored its interior without damaging the organ in any
way and without leaving after traces.The measure proposed offers no
special difficulties in its execution.The Paroxysms of Hepatic Colic.--The pain of hepatic colic being {1082}
the most acute suffering known to man--in its severest form at
least--the most powerful anodynes are required.The measures employed
for relief of pain happen to be the most efficient for promoting the
expulsion of the calculus and for limiting, if not preventing, the
subsequent inflammation.As soon as the character of the seizure is
manifest a hypodermatic injection of morphine and atropine--1/8 to 1/2
grain of the former and 1/200 to 1/80 grain of the latter--should be
given; ether administered by inhalation if necessary; and by the
stomach chloroform, chlorodyne, or chloral.As the stomach is usually
exceedingly irritable, the subcutaneous injection of remedies is a
precious resource: this failing or contraindicated, relief may be given
by the rectal injection of laudanum or chlorodyne.As relief is often
afforded by the act of vomiting, the attempts to empty the stomach
should be encouraged, and to this end large draughts of warm water
should be given.Hot fomentations and mustard plaster should be applied
over the right hypochondrium, and an entire warm bath may be used if
available.Great relief is usually afforded by the action of purgatives.The
irritability of the stomach forbids the employment of drastic
purgatives, yet podophyllin resin is warmly commended by Dobell.It
must be given in small doses, and preferably dissolved in spirit.Calomel in one-grain doses, every four hours until it purges, allays
nausea and lessens the after-uneasiness in the right hypochondrium, but
mercurial treatment given with a view to a supposed cholagogue effect
only does evil by prolonged administration, especially if ptyalism is
induced.If evidences of portal congestion are present, such remedies
as euonymin, iridin, baptisin, and others of the cholagogue group give
good results.The most effective of the remedies of this kind is
ipecacuanha, given in purgative doses: the emesis induced by it favors
the extrusion of the stone, and the powerful cholagogue effect relieves
the portal congestion.Twenty grains at once, and repeated if need be
in three hours, is a suitable quantity.The various complications which may occur, and the results which follow
the migration of the calculus, require treatment adapted to the
conditions existing, and will be mentioned in the sections devoted to
these topics.Occlusion of the Biliary Passages; Stenosis of the Ductus Communis
Choledochus.DEFINITION.--By occlusion of the biliary passages is meant an
obstruction, internal or external, of the hepatic, cystic, or common
duct.The causes of the obstruction are various, but the results are
quite uniform; hence the term includes a complexus of symptoms of a
very distinctive type.Occlusion may be congenital or acquired: it is
the latter with which we have especially to deal.Stenosis signifies a narrowing which in its extremest form produces a
nearly complete obstruction; when the canal is entirely closed the term
occlusion is applied.Stenosis also may be congenital or acquired.PATHOGENY.--The conditions producing narrowing of a hepatic duct or its
complete obstruction are numerous, and some of them complex in their
relations.As regards the ducts themselves, the interference may {1083}
be entirely within the canal, or it may affect the walls, or it may be
wholly extraneous; as, for example, when a cancer of the pancreas
encroaches on the common duct.It will be convenient to consider the
causes of stenosis and obstruction from these points of view: 1,
internal; 2, of the duct walls; 3, extraneous.The most usual situations for the occurrence of those changes that lead
to occlusion by inflammatory adhesions are the beginning of the cystic
duct, obstruction of which is of little moment, and the end of the
common duct, which finally proves fatal.The passage of a large polyangular calculus may cause such irritation,
abrasion of the epithelium, and subsequent inflammatory exudation as to
effect a direct union of the opposing sides of the canal.This takes
place at the beginning of the cystic duct especially, since, owing to
the spasm of the gall-bladder and the absence of muscular fibres in the
walls of the duct, the stone crushes into, without passing through, the
canal.The inflammatory exudation thus excited may close the duct.Not
unfrequently the gall-bladder, full of calculi, is thus shut off from
the liver permanently.In one instance the writer has seen a calculus
wedged into the orifice of the cystic duct, whilst just beyond the
lumen was permanently obstructed by an organized exudation.Permanent
closure of the cystic duct is of far less consequence than of the
common duct, and may, indeed, be a conservative condition, as in the
case above mentioned, where numerous polyangular calculi may have
migrated, except the closure of the passage.The most usual point of obstruction in the course of the common duct is
the intestinal end, but various processes are employed to effect it.The first in importance is catarrhal inflammation.This seems the more
credible when it is remembered that to a simple catarrh of the mucous
membrane is due the temporary stoppage of the duct, producing jaundice
in much the largest proportion of cases.When the epithelium is
detached and granulations spring up from the basement membrane,
adhesions of the surfaces will readily take place, and the union may be
so complete as that all traces of the duct will disappear.It is
probable that in many, if not in most, of these cases the initial
condition of the canal is that of simple catarrh, the more positive
changes in the mucous membrane arising from peculiarities in the
tissues of the individual affected, or from local injury caused by the
passage of a concretion or irritation of pathological secretions of the
duodenum.Stenosis, and finally occlusion, of the common duct may arise from the
cicatrization of an ulcer.They
may result from catarrhal inflammation of a chronic type, much new
connective-tissue material forming, and in the process of
cicatrization, with the contraction belonging to it, the lumen of the
canal is so far filled up that the passage of bile is effectually
prevented.They may be produced in that state of the tissues which
accompanies certain cachectic and profoundly adynamic conditions, as in
severe typhoid fever.Such ulcers may also be due to the mechanical
injury effected by the migration of a gall-stone.In cicatrizing, a
tight stricture, impermeable to the passage of bile, may result, or the
lumen of the canal be entirely obliterated.In the latter case the duct
itself may disappear and leave no trace.An ulcer situated at the
duodenal end of the common duct and extending into the {1084} duodenum
may also in the process of healing so contract as to render the orifice
impermeable to bile.The same effect may follow the cicatrization of an
ulcer of the duodenum in the immediate vicinity of the orifice of the
common duct.Without the intervention of an ulcer as a means of explaining closure
of the common duct, this accident may be caused by a catarrhal
inflammation which effects denudation of the basement membrane, and
thence union may be produced by the mere contact of the
freshly-granulating surfaces.Congenital occlusion of the bile-ducts or
obstruction occurring in a few days after birth, it is probable, is
effected in this way, but no direct evidence of the process has thus
far been offered.During intra-uterine life, as at any period in
after-life, it seems necessary to the production of such changes that a
peculiar constitutional state must exist; otherwise, such a result
might happen to every case of catarrhal inflammation of the bile-ducts.The extent of the changes is further evidence in the same direction;
for not only are the walls of the duct in permanent apposition and
adhesion, but the duct degenerates into a mere fibrous cord, and in
some instances is nearly, even entirely, obliterated.[189]

[Footnote 189: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, p.The cystic or common duct--the latter to be chiefly considered--may be
occluded by the retention in its lumen of some foreign body.The
impaction of a biliary calculus has already been repeatedly referred
to, but there are some additional points demanding consideration.The
larger concretions may be stopped in the neck of the gall-bladder;
those small enough to enter the canal may be arrested at its bend
behind the neck, and the very entrance of the cystic duct may be
blocked, as in a case examined by the writer.The hepatic duct is very rarely permanently occluded.As the calibre of
this canal continuously enlarges downward, there is no point at which a
stone is likely to be arrested; nevertheless, it occasionally happens
that such an obstruction does occur.An example has occurred under the
observation of the writer, but the cause was a gunshot wound of the
liver.The most usual, and for very obvious reasons the most important, of the
sites where occlusion occurs is the common duct and at the termination
of the duct in the small intestine, the intestinal orifice.Just behind
and to the right of its orifice the duct is dilated into a fossa--the
diverticulum Vateri; and here concretions of a size to pass along the
common duct are stopped.It is not essential that the stone fit the
canal: it may do so and prevent any bile passing into the duodenum; it
may be a polyangular body, and, though wedged in, leave spaces through
which more or less can slowly trickle.Again, the diverticulum may contain numerous concretions,
which distend the canal greatly, but through the interstices of which
some bile can flow.Other foreign bodies very rarely close the intestinal end of the ductus
communis; thus, for example, a cherry-seed, a plum-seed, a mass of
raisin-seeds, may slip into the orifice after the passage of a
gall-stone has stretched it sufficiently.A much more common cause of
occlusion is an intestinal parasite, which crawls in and is fastened.The common round-worm is the most frequent offender, and much less
often liver-flukes find a lodgment there.{1085} The ductus communis choledochus may be closed by agencies acting
from without.They are various, but the most common are the
carcinomata.Primary cancer of the gall-bladder and gall-ducts,
although not of frequent occurrence, is by no means rare.It develops
in connection with the connective-tissue new formations produced by the
inflammation following the migration of large calculi.A very
instructive example has been examined by the writer.The patient, a
woman aged forty-eight, had had numerous paroxysms of hepatic colic,
and after death, which followed a protracted stage of jaundice by
obstruction, a large ovoid calculus, filling the gall-bladder, was
found, and an extensive organized exudation of inflammatory origin was
the seat of carcinomatous disease involving the cystic and common ducts
and closing the lumen of both.Cancer of the pylorus, of the duodenum,
of the pancreas, of the right kidney, and of the liver itself, not
unfrequently by exterior pressure permanently occlude the common duct.To this category of obstructing causes must be added enlarged lymphatic
glands of the transverse fissure, large fecal accumulations, tumors of
the ovaries and uterus, aneurisms of the abdominal aorta, and
especially aneurism of the hepatic artery, several examples of which
have been reported, and one has occurred in a case seen by the writer.The effects of obstruction are much less important when the cystic duct
is closed.The contents of the gall-bladder accumulate, constituting
the condition known as dropsy of the gall-bladder.A catarrhal state of
the mucous membrane is set up; the muco-pus formed mixes with the bile,
and the mixture undergoes fermentative changes which further alter its
character and impart to it irritating qualities, in consequence of
which the mucous membrane becomes more decidedly inflamed, and a still
more purulent fluid forms, so that ultimately the contents of the
gall-bladder are entirely purulent, and that organ may attain to
enormous size.Instead of a catarrhal inflammation leading to
suppuration, the mucous membrane may pour out serum abundantly, the
biliary contents and mucus disappear by absorption, and finally the
gall-bladder will be moderately distended by a serous-like fluid.No
further disturbance ensues, and the gall-bladder, thus shut off from
participation in the hepatic functions, ceases to give trouble.The results are far different when the obstruction occurs in the
hepatic or common duct, for then the bile can no longer perform its
double function of secretion and excretion--of contributing materials
necessary to digestion and assimilation, and excreting substances whose
removal is necessary to health.The liver continuing to functionate
after closure of the duct is effected, obviously the secretion of bile
continues to accumulate, and the irritation of the mucous membrane
causes a catarrhal state; mucus is poured out, and serum escapes from
the distended vessels.If the hepatic duct only is obstructed, the
dilatation will not involve the cystic duct and gall-bladder, but as
the common duct at its termination is occluded, usually the whole
system of tubes will be affected by the ensuing changes.The
alterations already described as occurring in the gall-bladder take
place in all the hepatic ducts.The bile-elements are absorbed, and the
fluid distending the whole system of hepatic tubes becomes finally a
semi-transparent serum or a very thin sero-mucus, having in bulk a pale
sea-green color.Although an intense jaundice {1086} coexists with the
obstruction, no portion of the bile escapes into the ducts.At the
beginning of the obstruction more or less bile is in the tubes, and
then the fluid will have a distinct biliary character; but as it
accumulates, first the bile-constituents disappear, then the
mucus--which at the outset was formed freely--is absorbed, and at last
only a colorless serum remains.This fluid, which has been examined
chemically by Frerichs, is found to be slightly alkaline, to have only
2 per cent.of solids, and to present no trace of any biliary
constituent.As the fluid accumulates the gall-bladder and ducts
dilate, sometimes to an enormous extent, the fluid they contain
amounting to several pints.The walls of the ducts grow thinner, and
may finally give way with the pressure or from external violence, the
fluid exciting an intense and quickly-fatal peritonitis.Important
changes occur in the structure of the liver also.With the first
retention of bile the liver conspicuously enlarges, and may indeed
attain to twice its normal size, but it subsequently contracts, and may
lessen in as great a degree as it had enlarged.Changes begin in the
glandular structure as pressure is brought to bear on the cells by the
enlarging ducts.The liver-cells become anaemic and the protoplasm
cloudy, but granular and fatty degeneration does not take place.Even
more important as an agency affecting the condition of the hepatic
cells is the hyperplasia of the connective tissue, which ensues very
promptly when an obstruction to the flow of bile arises from any cause,
as has been shown by Legg[190] and Charcot.[191] The liver on section
has a rather dark olive-green color, and is firmer in texture, owing to
the increased development of the connective tissue; the cells are
bile-stained and contain granules of coloring matter and crystals of
bilirubin, and although they are at first not altered in outline,
subsequently more or less atrophy is produced by the contraction of the
newly-formed connective tissue and the pressure made by the dilated
hepatic ducts.[Footnote 190: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, p.352
_et seq._]

[Footnote 191: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.205 _et
seq._]

SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms produced by occlusion of the cystic duct are
not sufficiently characteristic to be diagnosticated with any
certainty.When an attack of hepatic colic has slowly subsided without
jaundice, and an elastic tumor, globular or pyriform in shape, has
appeared from under the inferior margin of the liver in the position of
the gall-bladder, dropsy of that organ may then be suspected.As
paracentesis of the gall-bladder may be performed with ease, safety,
and little pain, the diagnosis may be rendered more certain by the use
of the exploring-trocar.Obstruction of the hepatic or common duct is accompanied by symptoms of
a very pronounced and distinctly diagnostic character.Without
referring now to the antecedent symptoms or to those belonging to the
obstructing cause, the complexus of disturbances following the
obstruction is the subject to which our attention must be directed.The
great fact dominating all other considerations is the stoppage of the
bile, whether this has occurred suddenly or slowly.Jaundice begins in
a few hours after the canal is blocked.At first there is yellowness of
the conjunctiva, then diffused jaundice, deepening into the intensest
color in two or three weeks, or, when the obstruction is sudden and
complete, in a few hours.At first the color is the vivid jaundice
tint, a citron or salmon or yellow-saffron hue, but this gradually
loses its bright appearance, grows darker, and passes successively into
a brownish, bronze-like, and ultimately a {1087} dark olive-green,
which becomes the permanent color.Under some moral emotional
influences there may be a sudden change to a brighter tint, lasting a
few minutes, but otherwise the general dark olive-green hue persists
throughout.In a few instances, after some weeks of jaundice, the
abnormal coloration entirely disappears, signifying that the liver is
too much damaged in its proper glandular structure to be in a condition
to produce bile.Such a cessation of the jaundice is therefore of evil
omen.Pruritus, sometimes of a very intense character, accompanies the
jaundice, in most cases appears with it, and in the supposed curable
cases it has persisted after the cessation of the discoloration.The
irritation may become intolerable, destroying all comfort, rendering
sleep impossible, and so aggravating as to induce a highly nervous,
hysterical state.The scratching sets up an inflammation of the skin,
and presently a troublesome eczema is superadded.In some of the cases
a peculiar eruption occurs on the skin and mucous membranes, entitled
by Wilson[192] xanthelasma.It has been carefully studied by Wickham
Legg,[193] who has ascertained the character of the changes occurring
in the affected tissues, and also by Mr.[194] As a rule,
this eruption appears after several months of jaundice, and manifests
itself first on the eyelids, then on the palms of the hands, where it
makes the most characteristic exhibit, and after a time on the lips and
tongue.It occurs in irregular plaques of a yellowish tint slightly
elevated above the general surface, and rarely assumes a tubercular
form.As was shown by Hilton Fagge, xanthelasma occurs more especially
in the milder cases of catarrhal icterus that had been protracted in
duration, but it is also occasionally seen in the jaundice of
obstruction.[Footnote 192: _Diseases of the Skin_, 6th ed., Lond., p.[Footnote 193: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, p.317
_et seq._]

[Footnote 194: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, vol.According to the stage of the disease during which the examination is
made the liver will be enlarged or contracted; more or less tenderness
may be developed by pressure in the area occupied by the ducts, and a
tumor in a position to effect compression may possibly be detected.The
area of hepatic dulness will be increased in the beginning of all the
cases in which the obstruction is complete, but will remain normal so
long as the flow of bile persists despite the obstruction.When
enlarged, the liver can be felt projecting below the inferior margin of
the ribs, and with it, in most cases, the elastic globular body, the
gall-bladder.The state of the hepatic secretion, and in consequence
the duration of the obstruction, may be ascertained by puncture of the
gall-bladder and withdrawal of some of its contents for examination.The presence of unaltered bile will indicate recent obstruction; of
serum, will prove long-standing interruption of bile-production.The
presence of concretions in the gall-bladder will indicate the character
of the obstructing cause, and an increased amount of bile of a normal
or nearly normal kind will be conclusive evidence that the obstruction
is in the course of the common duct.In a fatal case of permanent
occlusion examined by myself the cystic duct was closed by inflammatory
adhesions and the common duct was stopped up by a calculus.The enlarged area of hepatic dulness will, in a protracted case, not
continue.The proper secreting structure, the hepatic cells, undergo
atrophy, {1088} and the increased connective tissue--to the development
of which enlargement of the organ is mainly due--contracts.The
ultimate result is that the liver becomes sclerosed, and is distinctly
smaller, the area of hepatic dulness diminishing to a greater relative
extent than the area of dulness due to hypertrophic enlargement.The
contraction of the liver goes on at the rate that several months are
required to make the result evident on percussion and palpation.Not
unfrequently, the contraction is too slight to affect the percussion
note of the right hypochondrium, and then, to realize the condition of
the organ, the history and rational signs must be closely studied.Whilst the liver thus varies in size, the gall-bladder remains enlarged
and projects from the under surface of the organ, elastic, globular,
and distinctive.The shrinking of the liver from around it makes the
impression of growing size; it may be increasing, indeed, but more
frequently the enlargement is merely apparent.Whether the liver be enlarging or diminishing in size, its functions
are impaired, or indeed entirely suspended.As the digestive canal
receives the bile immediately on its production, it will be best to
begin with the gastro-intestinal disorders which accompany occlusion of
the bile-ducts.The appetite is either wanting entirely and food is
loathed, or an excessive or canine appetite is experienced.The latter
belongs rather to an early stage of the disorder, and comes on after
the first disturbance of the stomach belonging to the immediate effects
of the occlusion.The former is the result of long-standing
interference with the primary assimilation.The tongue is coated with a
thick yellowish fur, which, drying, is detached in flakes, leaving the
mucous membrane beneath red, raw, fissured, and easily bleeding.The
taste is bitter, and the mouth has a pasty, greasy, and unclean
feeling.There is much thirst, and as a rule the patient experiences a
keen desire for acid drinks and for fresh fruits.The stomach is rather
intolerant of food, and nausea comes on as soon as it enters the
stomach.The mucus and stomach-juice accumulating over night, in the
morning there is much retching and nausea until the acid and rather
foul contents of the organ come up.When food is retained it causes
much distress, gases of decomposition accumulate, distending the
stomach and giving prominence to the epigastrium, and eructations of
offensive gas, with some acid liquid, occur from time to time.Similarly, in the intestines the foods undergo decomposition instead of
normal digestion; gases of putrefaction are evolved, the abdomen
generally is swollen, and flatulent colic results.Very irritating fat
acids are liberated by the decomposition of the fatty constituents of
the food, which, with the acid products of the fermentation occurring
in the starch and sugar of the diet, cause a sensation of heat and
distress through the abdomen.Usually, the bowels are torpid, but in
some cases the stools are relaxed, having the consistence and
presenting somewhat the appearance of oatmeal porridge.They may be
firm, moulded, even hard.The gas discharged and the stools are
offensive, with a carrion-like odor.Sometimes decomposing articles of
food can be detected in the stools by very casual inspection--always,
indeed, when the examination is intimate.An excess of fat is also a
characteristic of the condition induced by occlusion of the ducts,
especially when the pancreatic duct is closed, as does happen in cancer
of the head of the pancreas.{1089} A significant change in the color of the stools takes place.They lose their normal brownish-red tint and become yellowish or
clay- or white, pasty, or grayish.Sometimes the stools are very
dark, tar-like in color and consistence, or more thin like prune-juice,
or in black scybalae.The most usual appearance of the stools in
occlusion is grayish, mush-like, and coarsely granular.The very dark
hue assumed at times or in some cases signifies the presence of blood.A dark tint of the evacuations may be caused by articles of food, as a
greenish hue may be due to the use of spinach; a clay- tint to
the almost exclusive use of milk; a grayish tint to the action of
bismuth; a bilious appearance to the action of rhubarb; and many
others.When the occlusion is partial, although it be permanent,
sufficient bile may descend into the duodenum to color the stools to
the normal tint, and yet all the other signs of obstruction be present.The bile-pigment, not having an outlet by the natural route, by the
intestine, passes into the blood; all the tissues of the body and the
various secretions and excretions, notably the urine, are stained by
it, constituting the appearance known as jaundice or icterus.This
malady has been described (see ante), but it is necessary now to give a
more specialized account of those conditions due more especially to the
prolonged obstruction of the biliary flow.These are a morbid state of
the blood; changes in the kidneys and in the composition of the urine;
a peculiar form of fever known as hepatic intermittent fever; and a
group of nervous symptoms to which has been applied the term cholaemia.It has already been shown that but little pressure is required to
divert the flow of bile from the ducts backward into the blood.Changes
consequently ensue in the constitution of the blood and in the action
of the heart and of the vessels.The bile acids lower the heart's
movements and lessen the arterial tension; hence the pulse is slower,
softer, and feebler than the normal.Should fever arise, this
depressing action of the bile acids is maintained; and hence, although
the temperature becomes elevated, the pulse-rate does not increase
correspondingly.There are exceptions to this, however, in so far that
the heart and arteries are in some instances little affected, but it is
probable under these circumstances that there are conditions present
which induce decomposition of the bile acids.The most important result of the action of the bile on the constitution
of the blood is the hemorrhagic diathesis.Soon after the occlusion
occurs in very young subjects--at a later period in adults--the
occlusion having existed for many months, in some cases only near the
end, the disposition to hemorrhagic extravasations and to hemorrhages
manifests itself.From the surface of the mucous membranes, under the
serous, in the substance of muscles, the hemorrhages occur.Epistaxis,
or nasal hemorrhage, is usually the first to appear, and may be the
most difficult to arrest.The gums transude blood, and wherever
pressure is brought to bear on the integument ecchymoses follow.The
conjunctiva may be disfigured and the eyelids swollen and blackened by
extravasations, and the skin of the cheeks and nose marked by stigmata.Haematemesis sometimes occurs, but the extravasations into the
intestinal canal more frequently--indeed, very constantly--take place
in a gradual manner, and impart to the stools a dark, almost black,
tar-like appearance.In the same way the urine may contain fluid blood
and coagula, or it may have a merely smoky {1090} appearance from
intimate admixture with the blood at the moment of secretion.Both the bile-pigment and bile acids exert an injurious action on the
kidneys.In cases of prolonged obstruction not only are the tissues of
the organ stained by pigment in common with the tissues of the body,
but the epithelium of the tubules, of the straight and convoluted
tubes, are, according to Moebius,[195] infiltrated with pigment.In
consequence of the size and number of the masses of pigment, the tubes
may become obstructed and the secretion of urine much diminished.Other
changes occur, due chiefly to the action of the bile acids, according
to the same authority.These alterations consist in parenchymatous
degeneration.The urine contains traces of albumen in most cases, and,
according to Nothnagel,[196] always casts of the hyaline and granular
varieties stained with pigment.As the alterations in the structure of
the kidneys progress, fatty epithelium is cast off, and thus the
tubules come finally to be much obstructed and the function of the
organ seriously impaired.To cholaemia then are superadded the peculiar
disturbances belonging to retention of the urinary constituents.[Footnote 195: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, vol.[Footnote 196: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.326;
also, Harley, _op.One of the most interesting complications which arises during the
existence of obstruction of the bile-ducts is the form of fever
entitled by Charcot[197] intermittent hepatic fever.Although its
character was first indicated by Monneret,[198] we owe the present
conception of its nature and its more accurate clinical history to
Charcot.As has already been pointed
out, the passage of a gall-stone may develop a latent malarial
infection or a febrile movement comparable to that caused by the
passage of a catheter, and known as urethral fever.Charcot supposes
that true intermittent hepatic fever is septicaemic in character, and
can therefore arise only in those cases accompanied by an angiocholitis
of the suppurative variety--such, for example, as that which follows
the passage of calculi.Illustrative cases of this fever, one of them
confirmed by an autopsy, have been recently reported by E. Wagner,[199]
who is rather inclined to accept Charcot's view of the pathogeny.A
remarkable case has been published by Regnard,[200] in which the
angiocholitis was induced by the extension of echinococcus cysts into
the common duct.Whilst there are some objections to Charcot's theory,
on the whole it is probably true that this intermittent hepatic fever
is produced by the absorption from the inflamed surface of the ducts of
a noxious material there produced.It may be likened to the fever which
can be caused by the injection of putrid pus into the veins of animals.[Footnote 197: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.178 _et
seq._]

[Footnote 198: Cyr, _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, p.[Footnote 199: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.[Footnote 200: _Gazette med.49, 1873, quoted by Wagner,
_supra_.]Intermittent hepatic fever, as its name implies, is a paroxysmal fever,
having a striking resemblance to malarial fever, but differs from it in
less regularity of recurrence, in the fact that urea is below the
normal amount instead of increased, and in the effect of quinine, which
in the case of malarial fever is curative, but not curative in hepatic
fever.The paroxysms are sometimes quotidian, rarely double quotidian,
tertian, quartan, and even longer, and in the same case all of these
varieties may occur; on {1091} the other hand, there may be entire
regularity of the seizures.The severity of the chill, the maximum
temperature, and the amount of sweating vary within considerable
limits; there may be merely a slight sense of chilliness or a severe
rigor; the temperature may rise to 101 degrees or to 104 degrees F.,
and there may be a gentle moisture or a profuse sweat.There does not
seem to be any relation between the extent and severity of the local
mischief and the systemic condition.The period of onset of intermittent hepatic fever, and its duration and
mode of termination, are by no means readily determined.Cyr fixes on
the paroxysms of colic as the beginning, but he obviously confounds the
chill and fever caused by the passage of a calculus with the true
intermittent hepatic fever.In a carefully-observed case, the facts
confirmed by an autopsy, E. Wagner[201] gives the clinical history of a
typical example of this malady: Gall-stones were found in the duodenum,
in the common and cystic ducts, but the most important one was a
polyangular stone obstructing the hepatic duct.There was an ulcer with
thickened margin at the entrance to the gall-bladder, and the mucous
membrane of the common duct near the intestinal orifice had a smooth,
cicatricial aspect of recent origin, indicating inflammatory
ulceration.The conditions favorable to the production of a morbid
material of a kind to induce septicaemic fever were therefore present.The onset of fever occurred ten days after the last seizure, time being
thus afforded for the local changes necessary.The duration of the
fever in this case was five months, but the existence of pulmonary
phthisis with cavities will explain this apparently protracted hepatic
intermittent fever.The duration of the disease in its usual form is
uncertain, and ranges between a week and two months, or even three
months, according to Charcot.[202]

[Footnote 201: _Deutsches Archiv fur klinische Medicin_, Band xxxiv.[Footnote 202: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie_, p.Suspension of work by the liver necessarily involves retention in the
blood of various excrementitious matters.The attempt of Flint[203] to
establish the doctrine of cholesteraemia has not been supported by the
evidence of contemporary or subsequent physiologists.This theory
denies to the other constituents of the bile any morbific action, and
concentrates those disturbances known as cholaemia on the effects of
cholesterin.As uraemia signifies not merely the presence of urea in
the blood, but of all of the toxic substances excreted by the kidneys,
so the word cholaemia comprehends all the constituents of bile having
power to derange the organism by their presence in the blood.[Footnote 203: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, 1862, p.349 _et seq._]

By cholaemia is meant those disturbances, chiefly nervous, which are
due to the presence of biliary excrementitious matters in the blood,
and not less to the effect on nutrition of the absence of bile from the
process of digestion in the intestine.As the atrophic changes proceed
in the liver, the quantity of urea and uric acid in the urine
diminishes, and presently leucin and tyrosin appear.Amongst the means
of differential diagnosis of hepatic intermittent fever from malarial
fever Charcot mentions the quantity of urea present--in the former
greatly lessened, in the latter much increased.There is, however, a
source of fallacy here not mentioned by Charcot: that is, the
variations in the amount of urea due to destruction of the hepatic
secreting structure.It follows that as changes {1092} occur in the
kidneys, to the condition of cholaemia is superadded the derangements
belonging to uraemia.When the occlusion has existed for some time--a variable period, partly
due to peculiarities of individual structure--there come on certain
characteristic symptoms of nervous origin: headache, hebetude of mind,
dull hearing, obscure or hazy vision, xanthopsia; somnolence and
greatly increasing stupor, leading into coma; rambling and incoherence
of mind, passing into delirium; muscular twitching, subsultus; muscular
weakness, deepening into paralysis; and finally, it may be, general
convulsions.As these derangements of the nervous system develop, a
light febrile movement supervenes, so that the whole complexus has the
typhoid type, or, as it can be more definitely expressed, the patient
thus affected lapses into the typhoid state.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Occlusion of the gall-ducts is an
essentially chronic malady in the greatest number of cases.As a rule,
the causes of obstruction operate slowly, but to this rule there are
exceptions.Permanent occlusion may take place suddenly, as when a
gall-stone is impacted immovably in the common duct, or when a
round-worm makes its way into the duct and is firmly fixed there,
incapable of further movement.When occlusion is once effected the gradual changes occurring in the
liver lead to slow decline of the nutrition; the bile-elements
circulating in the blood poison it and set up alterations in the
structure of the kidney, and ultimately, the brain becoming affected,
the end is reached by convulsions and coma.Although permanent
occlusion, if unrelieved, terminates in death, a small proportion of
cases get well, either in consequence of giving way of the obstructing
cause or from the opening of a new route to the intestine.Thus, a
calculus lodged in the fossa of Vater may suffer such injury to its
outer shell as to yield to the action of solvents, or, suppuration
occurring around it, the stone may be loosened and forced onward, or
ulceration may open a channel into the bowel.An incurable malady
causing the occlusion, the termination in death is only a question of
time.There are several
factors, however, whose value can be approximately estimated.When the
obstructing cause is merely local--as, for example, a gall-stone or the
cicatrix of a simple ulcer--the duration of the case is determined by
the mere effect of the suspension of the hepatic functions.As the
eliminating action of the liver and the part played by the bile in the
intestinal digestion are necessary to life, it follows that the
complete cessation of these functions must lead to death.The rate at
which decline takes place under these circumstances varies somewhat in
different subjects.Probably two years may be regarded as the maximum,
and three months the minimum, period at which death ensues when no
other pathogenetic factor intervenes.DIAGNOSIS.--To determine the fact of occlusion is by no means
difficult: the persistent jaundice, the absence of bile in the stools,
and the appearance of the bile-elements in the urine are sufficient.It
is far different when the cause of the occlusion is to be ascertained.The ease and safety with which the exploring-trocar can be used in
cases of supposed obstruction of the cystic duct enable the physician
to decide with confidence points which before could only be matters of
mere {1093} conjecture.The writer of these lines was the first to
puncture the gall-bladder and to explore, by means of a flexible probe
passed through the canula, the course of the duct.[204] It is possible
in this way to ascertain the existence of gall-stones in the
gall-bladder, to find an obstruction at the entrance of the cystic
duct, to demonstrate the presence of echinococci cysts, and to remove
for microscopical examination pathological fluids of various kinds.More recently, Whittaker and Ransohoff[205] of Cincinnati have
attempted the detection of a gall-stone impacted at any point by the
introduction of an exploring-needle; and this practice has been
imitated by Harley[206] of London, but without any reference to the
pioneer and prior investigation of his American colleagues.The case of
Whittaker and Ransohoff survived the exploratory puncture, but Harley's
case proved fatal from traumatic peritonitis.Notwithstanding this
untoward result, Harley persists in the advocacy of this method.It
must appear to any one familiar with the intricate arrangement of the
parts composing the anatomy of this region a most hazardous proceeding,
and hardly to be justified in view of the superior safety and certainty
of my method.To explore the interior of the gall-bladder an
aspirator-trocar is introduced; any fluid intended for microscopical
examination is then withdrawn, and through the canula a flexible
whalebone bougie is passed.[Footnote 204: _The Cincinnati Lancet and Clinic_ for 1878-79; also, W.
W. Keen, M.D., "On Cholecystotomy," _The Medical News_, Sept., 1884.][Footnote 205: _Lancet and Clinic_, 1884.][Footnote 206: _Lancet_ (London), July, 1884.]When icterus comes on in a few days after birth and persists until
death ensues by convulsions and coma, there can be no doubt regarding
congenital absence or impermeability of the common duct.Permanent
retention-jaundice, accompanied by the characteristic symptoms of that
condition immediately succeeding an attack of hepatic colic, is
probably due to impaction by a calculus.When, at or after middle life,
in a patient with a history of former attacks due to gall-stones, there
begins a fixed pain in the right hypochondrium, and subsequently
retention-jaundice, the existence of a malignant growth in connection
with the cicatricial tissue and ancient organized exudation should be
suspected; and this suspicion will be confirmed if subsequently a tumor
can be felt.If with a localized pain slowly-developing jaundice,
intestinal indigestion, fats and oils appearing unchanged in the
stools, and a condition of prostration more than is properly referable
to the derangement of the hepatic functions, come on in a man or woman
after thirty-five, cancer of the head of the pancreas should be
suspected; and this suspicion will be confirmed if a tumor can be
detected in that situation.It should not be forgotten, however, that
in emaciated subjects the head of the pancreas may be so prominent as
to be mistaken for a scirrhous growth.A pulsating tumor of the right hypochondrium, accompanied by jaundice,
may be an aneurism of the hepatic artery.Pulsation may be communicated
to a bunch of enlarged portal lymphatic glands, which will compress the
common duct, but in this case, as the increase in the size of the
glands is due to caseous, amyloid, or cancerous deposits, there will be
found a source whence these morbid products are derived, and will
explain the nature of a tumor thus constituted.The differentiation of hypertrophic cirrhosis from occlusion of a
slowly-forming character is by no means easy.In both jaundice {1094}
gradually appears; in both the liver is enlarged, but in hypertrophic
cirrhosis much more than in occlusion; and in the latter the
gall-bladder is full--may indeed be distended--whilst in the former it
is empty or contains but little bile.The history of the case may
indicate the nature of the symptoms.Previous attacks of hepatic colic,
and the symptoms of occlusion supervening on the last, are highly
significant of calculous occlusion.TREATMENT.--To ascertain the nature of the occlusion is a necessary
preliminary to any exact treatment.In many cases this must remain a
mere conjecture, when, of course, the treatment is only symptomatic.When it is probable or certain that the duct is obstructed by a
calculus, two methods may be resorted to for its removal: one method is
to break up the calculus by mechanical means; the other is to effect
its solution by chemical agents.Fracture of an impacted calculus is not a merely fanciful expedient.If
the site of the obstruction is ascertained, an attempt may be made to
penetrate the calculus by an aspirator-needle passed through the
abdominal walls, according to the method of Whittaker and Ransohoff.The dangers attendant on this mere puncture are great, and a fatal
result has occurred in one of the very few cases in which it has been
done.Less severe and dangerous methods for attempting the
disintegration of a calculus should be first tried, as follows: Make
firm friction with the fingers along the inferior margin of the ribs
and toward the epigastrium and umbilicus, whilst the opposite side
posteriorly is supported by the hand spread out and applied firmly.A
strong faradic current sent through the region of the gall-bladder and
ducts has in several instances seemed to do good--indeed, to remove
obstructions.A calculus impacted may be dislodged either by the
fracture of its surfaces or by the strong muscular contractions of the
abdominal walls and of the muscular layer of the duct.Most calculi are
easily broken, and when the smallest breach is made in the external
crust disintegration follows; and some calculi are so friable as to
yield to slight pressure.Furthermore, the slightest solution in the
continuity of the rind disposes the whole mass to dissolve in suitable
menstrua.Mechanical rupture is so important a step in the process of
disintegration of an impacted calculus that so serious an operation as
section of the abdomen as a preliminary to it should be considered.The
cavity exposed, the obstructed duct is found, and its retained calculus
is mashed without section of the duct.I find one instance[207] in
which this was done as a subordinate part of a cholecystotomy, and the
breaking up of the stone proved to be easy of accomplishment.It is
also the method of Tait, who proposes to mash the calculus by means of
suitable forceps fitted with padded blades.[Footnote 207: Harley's case, _op.cit._]

I have suggested a means of effecting solution of an impacted calculus
which seems, on further reflection, well worthy of consideration.The
proposal is to inject, through a canula introduced into the
gall-bladder, one of the solvents of the cholesterin calculus before
mentioned.I have already used the canula as a duct for the passage of
an exploring-sound, and have by means of it explored the interior of
the gall-bladder.It is quite as feasible to inject through the canula
a solvent, successive charges of which can be thrown in and withdrawn
by the aspirator.{1095} That the usual solvents introduced by the stomach can effect the
solution of impacted calculi has been declared impossible by
Trousseau;[208] and with this conclusion I unhesitatingly agree.I have
already discussed this part of the subject, and need now only refer the
reader to that section.[Footnote 208: _Clinique medicale_, _loc.cit._]

The various causes of obstruction besides calculi do not offer an
inviting field for the exercise of therapeutical skill.Each case must
be treated according to the nature of the obstructing cause; hence to
make an accurate diagnosis is an essential preliminary to suitable
treatment.DISEASES OF THE PORTAL VEIN.Thrombosis and Embolism of the Portal Vein; Stenosis; Pylephlebitis.DEFINITION.--By the terms at the head of this section are meant the
various pathological processes which induce coagulation of the blood in
some part of the portal system.As the portal vein is made up of many
branches coming from the various organs of the abdominal cavity except
the kidneys, and as it empties, so to speak, into the liver, it is
obvious that various and complex derangements will ensue on the
formation of thrombi.CAUSES.--Thrombosis of the portal vein occurs under three general
conditions: the blood is in a readily coagulable state; the action of
the heart is weak and the blood-current sluggish; the circulation
through the vein is impeded by external pressure.The coagulability of
the blood is increased in diseases characterized by an excess of its
fibrin-producing constituents, of which cirrhosis of the liver may be
mentioned as one having this peculiarity.In chronic maladies of a
depressing kind there may be simply a weak action of the heart, or the
muscular tissue of the organ may be affected by a fatty and atrophic
degeneration.The external pressure by which the blood-current through
the vein is impeded may be caused by the newly-formed connective tissue
of Glisson's capsule, by enlarged lymphatics in the hilus of the liver,
or by tumors of various kinds.The first named of these causes of
compression--atrophic cirrhosis--is most frequently acting.Very
rarely, organized exudations of the peritoneum may be so situated as to
compress the portal vein.This result can only happen when the hepatic
portion of the peritoneum is involved.Pylephlebitis exists in two forms: the adhesive and suppurative.The
former results in changes not unlike those of simple thrombosis.The
blood coagulates in the affected part of the vessel, the clot is
organized, and the vessel ultimately forms a solid rounded cord which
is permanently occluded.The suppurative variety is so different in its
origin and in its results that it requires separate treatment, and I
therefore postpone the consideration of it to the next section.{1096} SYMPTOMS OF THROMBOSIS AND ADHESIVE PYLEPHLEBITIS.--It is a
remarkable fact that the biliary function of the liver is not
necessarily affected in cases of occlusion of the portal vein.It is
true, in advanced cases of cirrhosis, when the interlobular veins are
obliterated by the pressure of the contracting newly-formed connective
tissue, the functions of the liver are arrested in so far as the damage
thus caused extends.Notwithstanding the blocking of the portal,
sufficient blood reaches the hepatic cells by the anastomosis between
the hepatic artery and the interlobular veins--an anatomical connection
demonstrated by Cohnheim and Litten.[209] So long as this anastomosis
continues bile will be formed, although the portal vein is occluded.[Footnote 209: _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lxvii.153, "Ueber
Circulationsstorungen in der Leber."]The most significant symptoms of thrombosis of the portal vein are the
sudden formation of ascites, which quickly assumes a very high grade,
and equally sudden passive congestion of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, enlargement of the spleen, and distension of the superficial
veins of the abdominal parietes.When these symptoms succeed to
cirrhosis of the liver, or appear after the formation of a tumor in the
hepatic region, or come on in the course of phthisis or chronic
inflammation of the hepatic peritoneum, the existence of thrombus of
the portal vein may be reasonably suspected.Coincidently with the occlusion of the portal vein the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane becomes the seat of a catarrhal
process, and to the fluid thus produced is added a much more abundant
transudation from the distended capillaries.Nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhoea result, the rejected matters being serous, watery, and in
many cases tinged with blood.Now and then quite a severe hemorrhage
takes place, and the blood is brought up by vomiting (haematemesis) or
is discharged by stool.Hemorrhoids form, and, in large masses
protruding, much pain is experienced, and free bleeding may result from
rupture of a distended vein.The veins of the abdominal parietes, which in the normal state are
invisible or at least not prominent, and which form anastomoses with
the portal, when the obstruction occurs dilate, sometimes to a
remarkable extent.The most important anastomosis is that between the
femoral and saphena and internal mammary and epigastric veins.When the
hepatic branches of the portal are closed, but the trunk remains
pervious, the parumbilical vein enlarges greatly, and, communicating
with the superficial veins of the anterior part of the abdominal walls,
forms a radiating network of tortuous veins to which is given the
striking title of caput Medusae.The most significant symptom of portal thrombosis is a quickly-forming
ascites.It is true, ascites is a common symptom in advanced cirrhosis,
but the rapid accumulation of fluid and the prompt filling of the
cavity after tapping distinguish that which arises from portal
thrombosis from all others.Besides its excessive extent, the ascites
presents the usual symptoms.Due to the same cause as the enlargement of the superficial veins, the
hemorrhages, the ascites, etc., there occurs considerable hypertrophy
of the spleen in many of the cases.It sometimes happens that the new
compensatory circulation and the hemorrhages from some part in the
{1097} usual route of the portal so dispose of the blood that the
spleen does not enlarge sufficiently to be readily made out.COURSE AND TERMINATION.--It is obvious that a condition such as that
induced by thrombosis of the portal must be comparatively quickly
fatal; but the cases vary in duration as the compensatory circulation
is more or less complete.Whilst the majority of cases terminate within
two weeks, instances of several months' duration are not unknown, but a
fatal termination, sooner or later, is inevitable in all cases.Coming on in the course of some chronic affection of the liver or some
obstructing cause exterior to the organ, there soon follow ascites,
nausea and vomiting, haematemesis, bloody stools of a liquid character,
enlargement of the spleen, distension of the abdominal veins, and the
distressing symptoms produced by an excessive accumulation of fluid in
the peritoneal cavity.DIAGNOSIS.--As there is no symptom of thrombosis of the portal which
may not be caused by advanced cirrhosis, the diagnosis rests on the
rapid production of the attendant phenomena and their conjoint
appearance.TREATMENT.--A symptomatic treatment is alone possible.The highly
irritable and congested intestinal mucous membrane precludes the
employment of hydragogue cathartics.Salines which cause outward
diffusion from the vessels are the only cathartics which can be used
with propriety.Action of the kidneys and of the skin must be
maintained.To this end the resin of copaiba in pilular form and
pilocarpine subcutaneously may be used.If the strength of the patient
will permit, leeches around the anus can be applied, and much relief
may be expected from free bleeding.It is probable that opening a
swollen hemorrhoid would give the same kind of relief as that caused by
a free hemorrhage.In any case the benefit derived from treatment must
be merely palliative and temporary.Suppurative Pylephlebitis.PATHOGENY.--Primary pylephlebitis rarely if ever occurs.On the other
hand, the secondary form is by no means uncommon; it succeeds to
ulcerative or purulent inflammation at some point in the circuit of
origin of the portal radicles.The most frequently-occurring cause is
ulceration and suppuration of some part of the intestinal tube, and
hence the most common result is multiple abscess of the liver.Pylephlebitis has often resulted from typhlitis; from ulcers of the
large intestine, as in dysentery; from such traumatic injuries as tying
hemorrhoids; from proctitis; from ulcers of the stomach and similar
morbid processes elsewhere within the range of origin of the portal
system.The inflammatory or ulcerative action
extends to and involves the walls of the veins, or some morbid material
diffuses through the vein walls.In either case coagulation of the
blood in the vessel ensues, and the clot undergoes a series of changes
resulting in the formation of emboli, which, carried into the main
current, are subsequently lodged in the hepatic capillaries.There are three steps in the morbid process: the changes in the vein
wall; the production and transformation of the thrombus; and the
formation of secondary suppurating foci in the liver.{1098} The appearance of the tunics of the inflamed vessels varies with
the stage at which they are examined.At first the walls of the vessels
are reddish from congestion, succulent, and swollen, infiltrated by
leucocytes and inflammatory exudation and the cellular elements
undergoing proliferation.The intima especially is much altered in its
appearance and structure, becoming thick, opaque, grayish or yellowish
in color, and having adherent to it a thrombus passing through its
characteristic changes.Ulceration of the intima then occurs, and the
purulent elements, with shreds of tissue, mingle with the degenerating
blood-clot, and ultimately there remains a purulent depot lined with
sloughing, even gangrenous, contents.Emboli detached from such
decomposing thrombus are arrested in the vessels of the liver, and
there set up a suppurating phlebitis, ending in an abscess formation,
or a quantity of pus from the original point of ulcerative phlebitis
passes into the portal vein, and is generally distributed through the
hepatic branches, here and there foci of suppuration being established
by the deposit of decomposing emboli.There may be numerous small
abscesses irregularly distributed through the liver, or there may be
one or two larger collections of pus.Very often the vessel whose
occlusion by a suppurating embolus has caused the mischief is
destroyed, and hence no communication with the abscess-cavity can then
be traced.These abscesses are not limited by a line of inflammatory
demarcation or by a limiting membrane, but the hepatic tissue adjacent
is congested and infiltrated with pus.Ulceration, abscesses, or purulent inflammation occurring at any point
within the area of origin of the radicles of the portal vein may induce
pylephlebitis and consequent hepatic abscess.There are two points at
which, suppuration established, secondary pylephlebitis is most apt to
occur: the caecum; the rectum.As respects the former, the symptoms of
typhlitis precede the hepatic disturbance; and as respects the latter,
usually dysentery, or rather proctitis, is the initial disease.In both
sources of the hepatic trouble the inferior hemorrhoidal veins are
chiefly concerned--a fact explicable by reference to the sluggishness
of the circulation and the distended condition of these veins, whence
it is that thrombus is very readily induced.Numerous instances of
pylephlebitis following suppurative lesions of the caecum have been
reported.One of the most recent, and at the same time typical,
examples of such conditions is that published by Bradbury[210] of
Cambridge, England.The initial lesion was "an ulcer the size of a
split pea" situated near "the junction of the vermiform appendix and
caecum.""The hemorrhoidal veins and the inferior mesenteric above were
filled with breaking-down clot and pus," and "the liver contained many
abscesses of various sizes, the largest about the size of a lemon,
which had burst through the diaphragm."As is so often the case, the
ulcer of the caecum produced no recognizable disturbance, and important
symptoms were manifest only when the emboli lodged in the liver set up
suppuration, when there occurred the usual signs of hepatic abscess.In
the West and South hepatic abscess due to pylephlebitis, induced by
proctitis, with ulceration of the rectum, is a common incident.Various
examples of this kind have fallen under my own observation.The
relatively greater frequency of this form of pylephlebitis is due to
the fact above {1099} stated, that the inferior hemorrhoidal veins are
voluminous, have a sluggish current, and are liable to over-distension
by pressure of feces and by external abdominal bands and clothing.Cases of a corresponding character arise from suppuration and
ulceration elsewhere within the portal circuit.Thus, Bristowe[211]
reports a case in which pylephlebitis resulted from an ulcer of the
stomach, the neighboring veins becoming implicated and the usual
results following.[Footnote 210: _The Medical Times and Gazette_, Sept.450,
"Proceedings of the Cambridge Medical Society."][Footnote 211: _Transactions of the Pathological Society of London_,
vol.When inflammation has begun in a radicle of the portal vein, it may
proceed to the liver by contiguity of tissue, the whole intervening
portion of the vessel being affected.Probably more frequently the
intra-hepatic portion of the portal is inflamed by emboli, and the
adjacent hepatic tissue then undergoes suppuration, as has been already
set forth.SYMPTOMS.--There being two points of disease--the primary lesion of the
peripheral vessel and the secondary results in the hepatic portion of
the portal--the symptomatology must have a corresponding expression.The stomach, the caecum, or the rectum, or some other organ or tissue,
being occupied by a morbid process, there will be a characteristic
complex of symptoms.Taking up the most usual primary disturbance, a
typhlitis or an ulcer of the caecum, there will be pain, tenderness,
and possibly fever, occupying in point of time the period proper to
such a malady and an amount of disturbance of function determined by
the extent of the lesion.The symptoms caused by a single small ulcer
of the caecum, as in the example narrated by Bradbury, may present no
characteristic features and may have little apparent importance, and
yet the lesion is productive of very grave consequences.When from any of the causes mentioned above a thrombus forms in a vein
of the portal system in consequence of the extension of the
inflammation about it, the case, what importance soever it previously
had, now takes on new characters.The onset of the inflammation of the
vein walls and the puriform degeneration of the thrombus is announced
by a chill--a severe rigor, or chilly sensations at least.At the time
of the chill, and sometimes before it, pain is felt, significant of the
lesion in the vein.When proctitis or typhlitis precedes the
pylephlebitis, pain appropriate to the malady is a significant symptom;
but the pain which comes on with the beginning of the inflammation in
the liver is a new sign.The most frequent sites of the pain are the
right hypochondrium and the epigastrium, but it may also be felt in the
left hypochondrium or in either iliac fossa.Unless there be diffuse
peritonitis the pain is accompanied by a strictly-localized tenderness
to pressure.The situation of the pain may afford an indication of the
vein attacked, and when there are two points at which pain is
experienced, one may originate at the first situation of the morbid
action; the other will be due to pylephlebitis.The fever succeeding the chill is decided, and in some cases may attain
to extraordinary height--a manifestation indicative of the pyaemic
character of the affection.The fever intermits or remits, with a more
or less profuse perspiration.The febrile phenomena are similar in
their objective expression to malarial fever, but there is an important
difference in respect to the periods of recurrence of the chills.The
paroxysms are very irregular as to time: there may a daily seizure at
different hours, or there may be several chills on the same day.In
other words, the {1100} paroxysms have the pyaemic characteristics
rather than the malarial.After a time the intermittent phenomenon
ceases, and there occurs a remission merely, the exacerbation being
preceded by chilliness and succeeded by sweating.The sweats are
characteristically profuse and exhausting.During the sweating the
temperature begins to decline, and reaches its lowest point just before
the chilly sensations during the early morning announce the onset of
the daily exacerbation of the afternoon and evening.The thermal line
exhibits many irregularities until the febrile movement assumes the
remittent type, when there occur the morning remission and nocturnal
exacerbation.The maxima may be from 103 degrees F. to 105 degrees,
even to 106 degrees.When the pain and chill come on, disturbances of the digestive organs
ensue.When a large vein of the portal system is occluded, the
remaining veins must be over-distended, and congestion of a part or of
all of the digestive tract will be a result.An acute gastric catarrh
is set up.The appetite is lost, the stomach becomes irritable, and
vomiting is a usual incident.Sometimes the disgust for food is
extreme, and the nausea and vomiting are almost incessant.The vomited
matters consist of a watery mucus mixed with thin bile after a time,
and now and then of a bloody mucus.Thrombosis of a stomach vein may
occur, to be followed by an acute ulcer, and from this considerable
hemorrhage may proceed, when the vomit will consist of blood.Such an
accident, happening to the mucous membrane of the intestine, will be
indicated by bloody stools if the ulceration is low down, or by
brownish, blackish, or chocolate- stools if higher up in the
small bowel.The tongue has usually a characteristic coating in these cases.Large
patches of a rather heavy and darkish fur form, and, cast off from time
to time, leave a glazed and somewhat raw surface.Sometimes there is a
profuse salivary flow, but more frequently the mouth is dry.The lips
are fissured or contain patches of herpes, and the buccal cavity may be
more or less completely lined by patches of aphthae.Diarrhoea is a usual symptom, the stools being dark when mixed with
blood, or grayish and pasty or clay- when there is jaundice.Three-fourths of the cases of pylephlebitis are free from jaundice.This symptom may occur at the onset when the common duct is obstructed
by a calculus, but in other cases it appears when the formation of pus
in the liver exerts sufficient compression of the hepatic ducts to
prevent the passage of the bile.When jaundice occurs, it is accompanied by the usual symptoms.The
urine, previously unchanged, is now  by bile-pigment, and the
alterations in the renal structure and function belonging to jaundice
also take place.It sometimes happens that the obstruction of the portal vein is
sufficient to cause enlargement of the superficial veins of the
abdomen, but the duration of the disease is usually too brief to permit
much deviation from the normal, except rarely.In the cases
characterized by the occurrence of diffuse peritonitis the abdomen will
present a swollen and tense appearance, and there will be acute
tenderness to pressure.The area of hepatic and splenic dulness is not
increased from the outset, but is evident, as respects the spleen, soon
after the obstruction at the liver, and as respects the liver when the
formation of abscesses occurs.{1101} COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course of pylephlebitis
is compounded of the disturbance at the original point of disease, and
of the secondary inflammation at the several points in the liver where
emboli set up purulent inflammation.There are, therefore, two distinct
symptom-groups, and a short intervening period in which the first is
being merged into the second.The duration is variable, but the extreme
limits are not remote from each other, the condition of pylephlebitis
terminating in from two weeks to three months, the shorter being the
more usual.The termination is death, doubtless invariably; for, as in
true pyaemia arising from other causes, the septic changes in the blood
are such as to preclude the possibility of a return to the normal
condition.DIAGNOSIS.--The main point in the diagnosis consists in the occurrence
of an evident local inflammation, followed by the signs of suppuration
in the hepatic region coming on subsequent to ulceration and
suppuration at some point in the peripheral expansion of the portal
system.Thus, when a proctitis with ulceration of the rectum has been
in existence for some time, there occur pain and tenderness in the
hepatic region, accompanied by an irregularly intermittent fever and by
profuse sweating, it can be assumed with considerable certainty that
emboli have been deposited in some one or more of the terminal branches
of the portal.The evidences of hepatic trouble--swelling of the organ,
jaundice, etc.--and of portal obstruction, which then supervene,
indicate with some precision the nature of the case.TREATMENT.--Although pylephlebitis wears a most unfavorable aspect, the
possibility of a favorable result should always be entertained by the
therapeutist.As absorption of medicaments must be slow--indeed, uncertain--by the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane when there is portal occlusion, it is
well to attempt treatment by the skin and subcutaneous connective
tissue.Gastro-intestinal disturbance--nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhoea--should be treated by a combination of bismuth, creasote, and
glycerin--remedies acting locally chiefly.Ammonia--the carbonate and
solution of the acetate--is indicated, and should be given for the
purpose of dissolving thrombi and emboli.Corrosive sublimate, carbolic
acid, and quinine can be administered by the subcutaneous areolar
tissue.Quinine may also be introduced by friction with lard, and in
considerable quantity.V. PARASITES OF THE LIVER.Echinococcus of the Liver; Hydatids of the Liver.DEFINITION.--The echinococcus is the intermediate or larval stage in
the development of the Taenia echinococcus--the completed
parasite--whose chief habitat is the intestine of the dog.As the
natural and clinical history of parasites is elsewhere treated of, the
subject is here confined to the development of echinococci cysts in the
liver, its ducts, and vessels.CAUSES.--The presence of echinococcus vesicles in the liver is due to
{1102} the migration of the embryo from the intestinal canal.As
Davaine[212] has ascertained by analysis of all the recorded examples
previous to the publication of his treatise, echinococci are found in
as large a proportion in the liver as in all the other organs combined.This statement is repeated with approval by Cobbold[213] and by
Heller.[214] The embryo, set free in the intestine from the food or
drink containing the ova, starts on its migration.There are several
reasons why the liver is selected for its habitat: it is the largest
accessible organ; the common duct and the portal vein offer the most
convenient roadway for reaching and penetrating its substance.The
exact route or routes of which the parasite avails itself in migrating
have not been definitely settled, although Friedreich has shown that
the portal vein is the medium of transmission of the Echinococcus
multilocularis.The comparative frequency with which the liver is
entered indicates that the portal vein is the favorite route of
migration.[Footnote 212: _Traite des Entozoaires et des Maladies vermineuses,
etc._, par C. Davaine, Paris, 1877, p.[Footnote 213: _Entozoa_, by T. Spencer Cobbold, M.D., F.R.S., London,
1874, p.iii of _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, p.PATHOLOGY AND SYMPTOMS.--The number of echinococci reaching the liver
varies from one to ten or twelve or more.They increase in size from
the time of their deposit in the organ, and ultimately attain to large
proportions.The rapidity of growth depends somewhat on the character
of the tissue in which imbedded, and the amount of disturbance of
function is determined by the position of the parasite in the organ.Echinococci may be deposited in any part of the liver--in the substance
of the organ, in the ducts, or in the vessels--but the most usual site
is near the capsule, and, developing outwardly in the direction of
least resistance, impart to the outline of the organ an irregular
contour.As the echinococci develop, the adjacent parts of the liver
pressed upon undergo atrophy, but the connective tissue of the organ
contributes to the formation of the dense capsule which envelops them.But as the increase in size is not rapid, although continuous, if the
cysts are situated at the periphery and adjacent to the capsule, they
may be present for many months without causing any distinct symptoms.In a case occurring under my own observation last year the only symptom
which attracted attention was an enlargement of the hepatic region, and
on examination a characteristic elastic, irregular, and painless tumor
could be readily detected by sight and touch occupying the right
hypochondrium and extending into the epigastric and umbilical regions.When the echinococci cysts impinge on the portal vein or on the hepatic
duct, there will be caused the usual results of such pressure--ascites
or jaundice, or both conditions may occur simultaneously, with
obstruction of both vein and duct.When the cysts develop downwardly,
the stomach and intestines will be displaced, and nausea and vomiting,
diarrhoea or constipation, and, it may be, considerable pain of a
colic-like character, will be caused.An upward development of the
cysts gives rise to more pronounced disturbances.The diaphragm is
pushed upward, the heart displaced, and the lungs, especially the
right, compressed.Occasionally the diaphragm is softened and
perforated by the pressure of the enlarging cysts, and the lungs are
ultimately tunnelled, the parasites being discharged by the bronchi.{1103} The growth of an echinococcus tumor may spontaneously cease, and
then retrograde changes take place, leading to its final disappearance.This arrest of development may occur without any obvious cause, but now
and then such a change from the ordinary course of tumors may be
effected by an external injury, as a blow on the abdomen, but more
frequently the death of the parasite is caused by ulceration into a
bile-duct, and the entrance of bile, which is a poison to these
hydatids.It sometimes happens that, opening into a duct of large size,
the daughter and granddaughter vesicles are slowly discharged through
it into the intestine, and thus a cure is effected.Inflammatory action
occurring in the cysts, adhesions may form and rupture into a
neighboring cavity take place.Direct communication may be established
with the intestine, or the cavity of the pleura or peritoneum be
entered, with results entirely disastrous.A necessarily fatal termination must also ensue when the hydatids
penetrate the ascending vena cava, but this accident is, fortunately,
very rare.The passage outward through the abdominal wall is an exceedingly
uncommon but fortunate issue of echinococcus of the liver, for in this
mode the hydatids may be discharged without much difficulty.The echinococcus vesicle is enveloped in a dense, resisting, and
elastic capsule, constructed out of the connective tissue of the part
in which it is deposited.The innermost layer of the vesicle is the
germinative (endocyst), and from its granular surface are developed the
brood-capsules and their scolices--_i.e._ the head with its suckers and
crown of hooklets.[215] Each vesicle may contain not only daughter, but
also granddaughter, progeny, numbering from a dozen up to many
thousands, and they will vary in size from the head of a pin to a
pullet's egg.It follows that the mother vesicles must also greatly
vary in size: they range from a large pin's head to a child's head.The
vesicles or sacs contain a clear, faintly yellowish, or opalescent
fluid, neutral or slightly alkaline in reaction, and holding in
solution a large per cent.of sodium chloride, but free from albumen.The specific gravity of the fluid ranges from 1007 to 1015, according
to the quantity of sodium chloride present.Succinic acid and also
haematoidin are usual constituents, besides the ingredients already
mentioned.[Footnote 215: _Entozoa_, Cobbold, p.273 _et seq._, chapter viii.]Although the form of hydatid or echinococcus cyst above described is
the usual one, there is occasionally produced an anomalous development
of the parasite, which from its resemblance to colloid cancer was
supposed to have this character until Virchow[216] unravelled the
mystery by demonstrating its true structure.This form of the parasite
is designated Echinococcus multilocularis.Its resemblance to colloid
cancer is the more striking because of the tendency of the interior of
the mass to undergo degeneration, to disintegrate, and to break up into
pus-sacs with greenish, cheesy, and bilious contents.An Echinococcus
multilocularis tumor is of almost stony hardness; it has a very dense
fibrous structure, intersected by cavities with thick gelatinous
contents.These minor cavities[217] are sacs of echinococci, but they
depart widely from the typical form, well-defined scolices being seldom
encountered.[Footnote 216: _Archiv fur Anat._, Virchow, vol.[Footnote 217: Carriere, quoted by Davaine, _op.{1104} Echinococci of the liver develop very slowly, and it is
characteristic of them to attain to very large proportions in most
cases without causing any very pronounced symptoms.There are certain
signs common to hydatids in any situation; there are others which are
due to particular circumstances.A hydatid tumor of the liver is smooth but somewhat irregular in
outline, and elastic, when it develops downward, extending below the
margin of the ribs.If, however, it grows upward, the area of hepatic
dulness extends in that direction beyond the usual limits; the
diaphragm is pushed up, the lungs forced upward to the left and
compressed, and the heart also displaced upward toward the left.The
extension of the tumor downward, in the direction of least resistance,
is more usual.If the walls of the abdomen are sufficiently thin, the
tumor large enough, and if made up of many daughter vesicles, there may
be evoked by palpation the very characteristic sign known as hydatid
purring.To produce this effect an oscillation must be caused by a
sudden impulse communicated to the tumor on one side, the hand resting
against the other side.This sensation is likened to the impression on
the eye of the vibration of a bowl of jelly.Even when there is a
well-defined tumor this symptom is comparatively infrequent, but if
present it is pathognomonic, since no other kind of tumor possesses the
property of oscillation and elastic collision of its several
constituents.When the tumor is so situated as to occlude the hepatic or common duct,
jaundice will be a symptom, and when the stomach is pressed upon there
will be epigastric oppression and nausea.If the vena cava is impinged
on or the portal vein, the usual results--ascites and oedema of the
lower extremities and of the scrotum--will be manifest.There is, of
course, nothing distinctive in these results.The Echinococcus multilocularis, situated in the substance of the
liver, causes the usual disturbances of a new formation in such a
position.Much of the hepatic tissue is destroyed by its growth, and
many of the minor ducts closed.Jaundice is an early symptom--the
first, indeed, in many cases--and is also one of the most persistent.It is present, according to Griesinger, in 10 out of 13 cases.The
usual gastro-intestinal disorders belonging to jaundice occur under
these circumstances; also the nervous disturbances of cholaemia.[218]

[Footnote 218: Davaine, _op.Enlargement of the spleen is a very frequent symptom, being present,
according to Davaine, in 11 out of 13 cases, and, according to Heller,
in 25 out of 29 cases, in which this fact was made the subject of
direct inquiry.Pressure on the vena cava causes oedema of the inferior extremities in
a small number of cases; and on the vena porta, ascites.There may
occur thrombosis of the portal, in which event the ascites will form
very quickly, and return as quickly after tapping.The usually placid course pursued by echinococcus of the liver may be
much modified by inflammation and suppuration.Having occurred, the clinical history
corresponds to other cases of hepatic abscess, and the reader is
therefore referred to the section on that topic for fuller information.DIAGNOSIS.--At the outset of echinococcus of the liver the {1105}
differentiation of the tumor from other tumors, and of the disturbances
produced by it as contrasted with the effects of other morbid growths,
becomes exceedingly difficult, if not impossible.The size,
painlessness, elasticity, the purring tremor of the echinococcus tumor,
afford a sure basis for constructing a diagnosis, and as ultimately
developed they become the means of accurate differentiation from other
morbid growths of that locality.All doubt as to the nature of a given
hydatid tumor of the liver may be set at rest by the use of the
aspirator.The discovery of the characteristic hooklets of the scolex
in the fluid withdrawn from the tumor will be conclusive as to the
presence of echinococci.The hooklets may be absent, as in the case of
acephalocysts, but the fluid is characteristic in other respects: it
contains a large quantity of chloride of sodium and is free from
albumen.Very great difficulty is experienced in diagnosticating an echinococcus
tumor developing from the upper surface of the liver, pushing the
diaphragm and lungs upward and displacing the heart to the left.Whilst
the physical signs may be, and are, usually alike when the condition
calling for diagnosis has existed for some time, there are means of
differentiating in the history of the cases and in the initial
symptoms.The origin and growth of the echinococcus tumor are obscure and free
from constitutional disturbance; the onset of a pleuritic exudation is
marked by pain, fever, and hurried respiration and by physical signs of
a characteristic kind.It is true there are cases of so-called latent
pleurisy in which a hydrothorax forms without any well-marked
indications, but it will usually be found that some local pain, hurried
breathing, or other symptoms existed from the beginning.Those cases of
hydrothorax accompanying renal and cardiac diseases are readily enough
associated with their original cause.Echinococcus of the liver may be confounded with abscess of the liver,
but a differentiation can be readily made by attention to a few
considerations, except in the rare condition of the Echinococcus
multilocularis which has proceeded to suppuration.In this latter
condition there are no means of differentiation, since an
abscess-formation has already occurred, nor is there any need to
attempt a distinction without the occasion of a difference.Sandra went to the kitchen.Echinococcus differs from abscess in history, in the character of the
swelling, and in progress.Abscess of the liver is preceded by
paroxysms of hepatic colic, by inflammatory ulceration of some part of
the intestinal tract, or by local injury--traumatism.The onset of a
hydatid tumor is silent and painless.The swelling of the liver when an
abscess forms is not considerable at any time, and appears to be a
uniform enlargement of the organ, except when the pus tends to make its
way through the walls of the abdomen externally.An enlarging
echinococcus tumor is an obvious projection from the surface of the
liver at some point, and it does not have the characteristic
tenderness, the fluctuation of an abscess matured and ready to
discharge, and the constitutional disturbance; but it does have a
peculiar elasticity, and now and then may present that eminently
characteristic sign, the purring tremor.The use of the
exploring-trocar will usually suffice to clear up all doubts by the
withdrawal of the characteristic fluid of the hydatid cyst or of pus.DURATION AND TERMINATION.--The progress of an echinococcus {1106} tumor
is exceedingly slow, and the development of symptoms produced by its
extension is early or late according to its position and to the nature
of the parts impinged on.A spontaneous cure may take place under the
rather rare circumstances of an opening into the hepatic duct or one of
its principal divisions, and the gradual discharge of the cysts by this
outlet into the intestine.Next to this mode of termination, the most
fortunate direction taken by the enlarging cysts is through the walls
of the abdomen externally.When the growth is upward through the lungs,
the symptoms belonging to empyema or hydrothorax, with pulmonary
abscess, ensue, and the termination is fatal after a protracted course.Rupture into the peritoneal cavity is a fatal event.Ulceration into
the intestine, and the discharge of the cysts through the route thus
made, may effect a cure, but more frequently the fistulous
communication becomes a means of forming a fecal abscess.The result in any case of hydatids of the liver is much influenced by
the mode of treatment adopted and the period at which it is undertaken.As these parasites can be readily reached and destroyed by safe means,
obviously the more early the diagnosis is made and the treatment
carried out, the less the injury done to the hepatic structures and
neighboring parts.TREATMENT.--Prophylactic.--As the intestine of the dog is the natural
habitat of the Taenia echinococcus, and as the hydatid is the first
stage in the development of the ovum and the second in the life-history
of the parasite, the means of prophylaxis consist in preventing
contamination of human food and water with the dog's excrement, which
contains the ova of the parasite.In Iceland, where hydatid disease is
very prevalent, dogs and human beings living in the same huts and
obtaining their water-supply by melting the snow just about them,
contamination of food and drink must readily occur.In this country
such conditions cannot exist; nevertheless, cases of hydatids are not
infrequent.The chief, if not the only, source of contamination is
through the consumption of such uncooked vegetables as lettuce, celery,
cabbage, etc., in the folds of which the ova may be retained, and from
which an ordinary washing does not suffice to detach them.It follows
that such articles of food should be minutely inspected and cleansed
before being placed on the table.Boiling and filtration are the means of removing impurities of this
kind from potable waters.Therapeutical.--The remedial management of cases of Taenia echinococcus
is necessarily restricted to that stage in their development when by
increasing size the functions of organs begin to be affected.Internal
medicines given with the view to arrest the growth of the parasite are
useless.Formerly, such attempts were made and successes were claimed,
but it is now known that no medicine can act on organisms enclosed as
these are in a dense capsule.It is needless to occupy space with
therapeutical details of this kind, but mention may be made of the
agents that were supposed to be effective.Laennec held that baths of a
solution of common salt had a distinct curative effect.The internal
use of iodide of potassium and the local application of iodine paint
were believed to cure a case in St.George's Hospital, London, in the
practice of Mr.Kameela was, in Iceland, supposed to
have a curative effect, but notwithstanding this the physicians of that
island resort to very heroical surgical methods in the treatment of
this affection.{1107} The one means of relief consists in the removal of the vesicles,
either by suitable incisions or by compassing the death of the
parasite, after which the power of nature may be adequate to the cure.In Iceland large incisions are made into the tumor at its most
prominent part, and, although accidents are not uncommon, the results
in many cases are eminently satisfactory.The accidents are shock,
hemorrhage, and especially peritonitis.Under favorable circumstances
now no procedure is more satisfactory in its results than free incision
and drainage.The tumor should be prominent, adherent all round to the
peritoneum, and the walls of the abdomen thin to ensure complete
success without accident.At the present time, so great have been the
advances in abdominal surgery, this operative procedure may be
preferable in some few cases presenting the favoring conditions above
mentioned.Very simple expedients, however, suffice in most cases.This is now much practised in Iceland, and, as the
statistics show, with considerable success.Thus, Hjaltelin[219]
reports 100 cases cured in this way, and in his own hands this
expedient proved successful in 41 out of 50 cases operated on.In
Australia, where hydatid disease is also quite common, simple puncture
has effected a large proportion of cures,[220] and is the method of
treatment usually pursued.In England puncture has the approval of some
of the best authorities.[221]

[Footnote 219: Davaine, _op.[Footnote 220: _The Medical Times and Gazette_, August, 1873, p.[Footnote 221: _Transactions of the Clinical Society_ for 1872:
discussion participated in by Gull, Bryant, Greenhow, etc.]The mode of performing this operation consists in the introduction of
an exploring-trocar into the most prominent part of the tumor.It may
be withdrawn at once or be permitted to remain for a few minutes to
several hours.The dangers are suppuration in the sac and peritonitis;
but the former, although sometimes accompanied by severe constitutional
symptoms, is not likely to endanger life, and even formidable
disturbances due to the latter are usually recovered from.The facts
show that puncture very rarely indeed causes dangerous, especially
fatal, symptoms.An eruption of urticaria has been observed to follow
puncture with the trocar, and also aspiration, in a considerable
proportion of the cases, but it has no special significance.Since the introduction of the aspirateur, puncture and withdrawal of
the fluid by means of this instrument has been practised more
frequently, and this appears to be a more effective procedure, than
simple puncture with an exploring-trocar, although in most cases the
escape of the contained fluids suffices to destroy the parasite.The
aspirateur is less likely to permit the escape of fluid into the
peritoneal cavity or the entrance of air into a vein punctured by
accident.If puncture with the trocar or aspiration be practised, shall
all the fluid be withdrawn at once?The answer to this question may be
decided by the character of the sac.Does it contain daughter and
granddaughter vesicles?If so, one puncture may not permit the escape
of much fluid; but in any event it is the practice of the most
judicious and experienced authorities[222] to withdraw as much as
possible of the contents of the cysts at the first operation.Formerly,
a method practised by some French surgeons consisted in successive
tappings, a small quantity of fluid being drawn off each time.[223]
{1108} There is no good reason for this method of treatment now, and it
seems to have been discontinued.[Footnote 222: _Transactions of the Clinical Society_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 223: Davaine, _supra_.]Yet another method of treatment, but less effective than puncture or
aspiration, consists in injecting into the sac, after the removal of
its contained fluid, certain agents toxic to hydatids.A solution of
the extract of fern, alcohol, solution or tincture of iodine, and bile,
are the chief remedies thus employed.It has long been known that bile
is destructive of these parasites, and cases have occurred of
spontaneous cure in which the opening of the growing cysts into a
bile-duct has secured the entrance of bile and consequent arrest of
growth and atrophy of the hydatids.Several successful cases have been
reported in which the injection of aspidium (male fern) was the
effective agent, but the threatening symptoms produced by it, and the
comparative freedom of other methods of treatment from such
disturbances, do not recommend the injections of fern.In the case
reported by Pavy[224] the extract of fern was mixed with a solution of
potassa.[Footnote 224: _Lancet_ (London), July, 1865.]Injections of iodine in solution or in the form of tincture have been
more frequently practised than of any other material.Davaine,[225] who
finds it less successful than simple puncture and aspiration,
recommends, as affording the best results, a dilute aqueous solution of
iodine.Alcohol, a solution of permanganate of potassium, and various
antiseptic agents have been used to some extent, but none of them
possess any advantages over more simple measures.The latest proposal for the treatment of hydatid cysts, and probably
the most effective consistent with entire safety, is electrolysis.Originally suggested by Althaus[226] to those who first employed the
measure on any considerable scale, it had been mentioned thirty years
before by Budd, and appears to have been first practised in Iceland on
a single case.The first elaborate attempt to establish electrolysis on
a sound basis as a regular procedure was made by C. Hilton Fagge and
Mr.[227] They operated on eight cases, and all were
successful.The method consists in the introduction of two needles
connected with the negative pole, and the application of the
positive--a moistened sponge--on the exterior in the neighborhood of
the hepatic region.The strength of current employed by Fagge and
Durham was that furnished by a battery of ten cells, and which by
previous trial was found to decompose a saline solution.The two
electrolytic needles, connected with wires attached to the negative
pole, were introduced into the most prominent part of the tumor about
two inches apart.The current was allowed to pass about ten minutes
usually, sometimes a little longer, the sponge on the exterior--the
positive pole--being shifted occasionally.The tumor may be rendered somewhat more tense and
appear to be enlarged, but more frequently it becomes softer and is
lessened in size, the increase of size being due to the disengagement
of hydrogen gas, and the diminution caused by the escape of more or
less fluid.In one case
no symptom followed, and in this the result was regarded as doubtful,
although a cure was considered probable.In the others more or less
{1109} constitutional disturbance followed, the symptoms being pain and
fever, the temperature ranging between 100 degrees and 103 degrees F.
The duration of the fever was from two to nineteen days, the latter in
one case only.As has been observed in some of the cases treated by
puncture or by aspiration, a rash appeared on the skin--in some
instances scarlatinous, in others of urticaria.It is a curious
circumstance that an eruption of urticaria is reported to have appeared
in one subject in whom a rupture of the sac into the peritoneal cavity
is supposed to have occurred.[Footnote 226: _On the Electrolytic Treatment of Tumors, etc._, London,
1867.][Footnote 227: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, 1871, p.1 _et seq._]

Although so little change in the tumor occurs immediately after the
operation, yet it undergoes slow absorption, and ultimately disappears.The time occupied in the disappearance of the tumor varies from a few
weeks to many months, the difference being due probably to the
situation of the growth, those occupying the substance of the liver
requiring a longer time to fill up.Fagge and Durham report a case in which simple acupuncture was followed
by a result apparently as good as obtained by electrolysis, and other
similar experiences have been published.If the simple introduction of
a needle suffices to arrest the growth of a hydatid cyst and induce its
atrophy, of course the more complex procedures will be abandoned.The tendency of the treatment of hydatid cysts has constantly been
toward simplicity, and the success occurs in a direct ratio thereto.In
forming an estimate of the relative value of the methods of treatment,
the average of mortality of each plan becomes the most important
factor.Simple tapping and paracentesis, the most frequently adopted
mode of treatment, is not without immediate and remote danger.Of 46
cases carefully tabulated by Murchison,[228] there were 3 deaths
properly attributable to the operation; but the after
results--suppuration of the cyst and its consequences, peritonitis,
etc.--cannot be measured so accurately.About two-thirds of the cases
thus treated result in cure, and in a majority of these a single
operation suffices.The injection of the various substances which have
been employed for that purpose does not seem to increase the proportion
of cures, and their use distinctly enhances the dangers of the
treatment.At present, the decision as to the method of treatment to be
employed in any case should be made between simple tapping,
electrolysis, and acupuncture.Of these, the last mentioned, it can
hardly be doubted, is the method which is most desirable, for although
it has not been employed so largely as the others, thus far the results
have been better: the percentage of recoveries without accident has
been higher relatively than by other methods of treatment.As
acupuncture presents no special difficulties or dangers, and is but
little painful, it may be tried first, reserving more formidable
measures for the failures by this simple expedient.[Footnote 228: _Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, _loc.cit._]


Distoma hepaticum and Distoma lanceolatum (Liver-Flukes).The Distoma hepaticum, entitled by Linnaeus Fasciola hepatica, occurs
very frequently in herbivorous animals and occasionally in the biliary
{1110} passages of man.[229] It is, however, less important than the
Distoma lanceolatum, which, although much smaller than the former,
occurs in much larger numbers.[Footnote 229: Davaine, _Traite des Entozoaires_, Paris, 1877, p.240
_et seq._; also, Cobbold, _Entozoa_, p.Distoma hepaticum is a leech-like parasite from 25 to 30 mm.in length,
of a brownish color, smooth to the naked eye, but thickly covered with
minute spikes or spines to be seen with a low power, and provided with
a cephalic (entrance to oral cavity) and an abdominal sucking disk,
which are also organs of locomotion.The Distoma lanceolatum owes its
name to its lancet shape; it is smaller than D. hepaticum, measuring
about 8 mm.in length and half this or less in width; it is unprovided
with spines, but contains two suckers at the side.Both parasites are
hermaphrodite; the ova, according to Cobbold (p.166), have "an average
longitudinal diameter of 1/180, whilst their greatest transversal
measurement is about 1/270."These ova are capable of some movement,
provided as they are with a ciliated envelope.The disease known as the rot in sheep, and a peculiar cachexia entitled
by Davaine la cachexie aqueuse, are caused by the presence of distoma.The ova gain access to man through the use of unwashed cress, lettuce,
and similar vegetables eaten in the raw state, and in drinking-water.The number of reported examples
collected from all sources by the indefatigable Davaine is twelve.[230]

[Footnote 230: _Ibid._, p.253 _et seq._]

The larger distoma passes into the common and hepatic duct and
gall-bladder, whilst the smaller (lanceolatum) enters the finer
ramifications, and, there multiplying, several consequences may ensue.The irritation caused by their presence and development will excite a
more or less severe cholangitis, or, accumulating in sufficient
numbers, an actual obstruction will be induced, and jaundice and
structural alterations of the liver will in turn be brought on.The DIAGNOSIS of such a malady is, in the very nature of the case,
uncertain at best, and in most cases impossible.Nevertheless, it may
be made in rare instances.The existence of the rot may cast suspicion
on the mutton and kitchen vegetables so situated as to suggest the
possibility of contamination with the ova of distoma.Definite and
conclusive information will be afforded by the presence of the ova,
still more of the more or less fully-developed parasite, in the feces
of a patient effected by the symptoms of catarrhal jaundice or
occlusion of the biliary passages.By tapping the gall-bladder
parasites may be withdrawn.The SYMPTOMS are those common to cases of catarrh of the bile-ducts
(cholangitis), catarrhal jaundice, or occlusion of the passages, as may
be.As these have been detailed under their respective heads, it is not
necessary to repeat the observations already made.As regards the TREATMENT, in addition to the methods of management
recommended in such cases it may be stated that the use of certain
parasiticides offers a reasonable prospect of good results.Creasote,
bichloride of mercury, thymol, eucalyptol, oil of wintergreen
(gaultheria), and similar agents are rational remedies and should be
fairly tried.{1111} Parasites in the Portal Vein.The entozoon which by its presence in the blood causes the disease
chyluria also inhabits the portal vein.In some parts of the
world--Brazil more especially--this disease is exceedingly common.It
has occurred also in two or three instances in England, and the writer
has had a case within the past year (1884) in Philadelphia.The
parasites in this case were found in immense numbers in the urine.The blood of the portal vein sometimes is actually filled, and the
liver substance itself is penetrated, by them, but nothing is known of
the alterations they induce in these organs.When cases of haematuria
or chylous urine due to the Filaria sanguinis hominis occur, the
changes are not confined to the urinary organs, but often, doubtless,
involve the liver.There are no signs in the present state of our
knowledge by which the existence of these parasites in the portal vein
and liver can be determined.{1112}

DISEASES OF THE PANCREAS.BY LOUIS STARR, M.D.Until the middle of the seventeenth century the prevalent views upon
the functions and diseases of the pancreas were vague in the extreme.By some the organ was regarded simply as a cushion provided for the
protection of the neighboring blood-vessels and nerves; by others it
was looked upon as the seat of lesion in many very diverse diseases, as
ague, hypochondriasis, melancholia, and so on.In 1642, Wirsung's discovery of an excretory duct demonstrated the fact
that the pancreas was a special organ, and initiated the successful
investigation of the physiology and pathology of the gland.For many
years after this, however, little progress was made, and it is only
comparatively recent investigations that have furnished definite and
reliable information upon the subject.Even now our knowledge of the
clinical and pathological features of diseases of the pancreas is far
behind that of many of the other viscera of the body, the chief reasons
for this being the uncertainty in regard to the physiology of the gland
and the rarity with which its lesions are primary and uncomplicated.ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.--The pancreas is a long, somewhat flattened,
narrow, acinous gland, pinkish-white in color, and of looser texture
than the salivary glands, which it otherwise closely resembles in
structure.It is hammer-shaped, measures from six to eight inches in
length, one and a half inches in breadth, and about three-fourths of an
inch in thickness, and varies in weight from three to five ounces.The
gland is situated in the upper part of the abdominal cavity; the
expanded portion, or head, lies in the concavity of the duodenum;
thence it extends transversely across the epigastric and both
hypochondriac regions on a level with the first lumbar vertebra and in
contact with the posterior abdominal wall.As it passes toward the left
it gradually decreases in size, and the narrowest part, or tail, rests
against the spleen.Behind the organ are the crura of the diaphragm,
the aorta, the inferior cava, the superior mesenteric vessels, and the
solar plexus; in front of it, the stomach and the left lobe of the
liver.Its anterior surface alone is invested with peritoneum, being
covered by the posterior layer of the lesser omentum.The ascending
portion of the head is intimately connected with the duodenum by dense
connective tissue, and at times the descending portion, by extending
backward and outward, forms an almost complete ring around the gut; the
body is loosely attached by connective tissue to the posterior
abdominal wall, and the {1113} left extremity and tail are joined to
the left kidney and suprarenal capsule and to the spleen by loose
areolar tissue.The gland is supplied with arterial blood by branches
springing from the pancreatico-duodenal and splenic vessels; its veins
join the splenic and superior mesenteric veins; its lymphatics
communicate with the lumbar glands; and its nerves are branches from
the solar plexus.The principal excretory duct, the canal of Wirsung,
has at its widest part the calibre of a goose-quill.It begins by the
union of five small branches at the tail, and extends transversely
through the substance of the gland from left to right, nearer the lower
than the upper border, and the anterior than the posterior surface; it
is joined throughout its course by numerous small branches from the
acini, which enter it at acute angles.In the head the duct curves
slightly downward, and as a rule opens with the ductus choledochus into
the ampulla of Vater in the second portion of the duodenum; sometimes,
however, it has a separate opening into the intestine.A second,
smaller, duct runs from the ascending portion of the head, and usually
joins the main duct, but may also open independently.The acini of the gland are from.045 mm.in diameter, and
are composed of a very thin membrane lined with pavement cells.The
thin walls of the excretory ducts are formed of connective tissue and
elastic fibres, and are lined by a single layer of small cylindrical
epithelial cells.The terminal extremities of the ducts form a complete
network around the glandular cells, resembling the intralobular biliary
canaliculi.The acini are imbedded in a mass of adipose tissue which
contains the vessels and nerves.The topographical relation of the head of the pancreas to the ductus
choledochus is of clinical importance.As a rule (fifteen times in
twenty-two, Wyss), the bile-duct descends near the head, toward the
duodenum; frequently it runs through this part of the organ, being
either partially or entirely surrounded by the gland substance.Now,
when the bile-duct merely passes over the pancreas, any enlargement,
unless excessive, would simply push it aside, but when it passes
through the head, a comparatively slight amount of disease is
sufficient to close it entirely and cause jaundice.It is only since the observations of Bernard in 1848 that the
prominence of the pancreatic juice as a digestive fluid has been
recognized.It fulfils several important purposes: in the first place,
it emulsifies the fatty articles of food; secondly, it converts starch
and cane-sugar into glucose; and, finally, it supplements the action of
the gastric juice upon nitrogenous materials and completes their
digestion.Each of these changes is probably brought about through the
agency of a special ferment (Danilewsky).The pancreatic juice is not
secreted continuously.According to the observations of Bernstein,
there are two separate secretory flows following each ingestion of
food--one occurring shortly after the food enters the stomach; the
other a few hours later, corresponding in time to the passage of the
food from the stomach into the intestine, the latter being followed by
a period of rest until the next meal.Both the condition of nausea and
the act of vomiting arrest the secretion.When the vagus is divided and
the central extremity of the cut nerve is irritated, the secretion is
also arrested, and remains checked {1114} for a long time.The arrest
in each instance is attributed to reflex action of the spinal cord and
sympathetic nerve.At the same time, irritation of the mucous membrane
of the stomach caused by the presence of food increases the flow of
pancreatic juice, and so too does simple section of the nerves which
accompany the arteries.It would seem, therefore, that the gland is
under the influence of two sets of nerves from the vagus--one
inhibiting, the other exciting, its secretion.GENERAL ETIOLOGY.--Pancreatic disease occurs more frequently in men
than in women.No period of life is exempt from it, but it is most
commonly met with in the aged.The predisposing causes are
constitutional syphilis, pregnancy, and hereditary tendency.Among the
apparent exciting causes may be mentioned the habitual over-use of
alcoholic drinks, gluttony, the excessive use of tobacco, suppression
of the menstrual flux, the abuse of purgatives, excessive and prolonged
mercurial medication, and mechanical injuries, either prolonged
pressure or blows upon the epigastrium.As a secondary affection,
disease of the pancreas is associated with chronic diseases of the
heart, lungs, liver, alimentary canal, and abdominal glands, and the
organ may be the seat of metastatic abscesses and tumors.GENERAL SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The objective symptoms are--rapid and extreme
emaciation of the entire body; sialorrhoea; obstinate diarrhoea with
viscid stools; fatty stools; lipuria; and the presence of masses of
undigested striped muscular fibres in the stools.The well-established fat-absorbing and peptonizing properties of the
pancreatic juice furnish a ready explanation of the wasting of the body
which occurs when this secretion is arrested, diminished in quantity,
or altered in quality by disease.Emaciation is not a constant symptom
of pancreatic disease.A number of cases are mentioned by Abercrombie,
Claessen, and Schiff in which, notwithstanding disease of the gland and
complete closure of the duct, revealed by post-mortem examination, the
patients during life were not only well nourished, but even moderately
corpulent.In such instances it is probable that the digestive
functions of the absent pancreatic juice are more or less adequately
performed by the bile and succus entericus.When present, emaciation is
an early symptom; it is at the same time progressive, and is usually
very intense in degree, being most marked in those cases where there is
associated hepatic disease or obstruction to the passage of bile into
the intestine, where the disease of the pancreas interferes
mechanically with the processes of nutrition by pressing upon the
pyloric extremity of the stomach or upon the duodenum, and when the
organ is the seat of carcinomatous growths.In the last-named
condition, in addition to the perversion or arrest of the secretion,
the loss of flesh is attributable to the general causes of malnutrition
attendant upon carcinoma wherever situated.Sialorrhoea, or an excessive secretion from the salivary glands, is
noticeable as a symptom of disease of the pancreas only when there is
an associated lesion of the stomach, either of a catarrhal or cancerous
nature.Under these circumstances a quantity--six or eight
fluidounces--of a colorless, slightly opalescent, and adhesive and
alkaline fluid may be expelled from the mouth at once as an early
morning pyrosis; or by frequent and repeated acts of expectoration,
following a sudden filling of the mouth with fluid, a large bulk of
thin saliva may be expelled {1115} during the day.This hypersecretion
must not be looked upon as any indication of an especial sympathy
existing between the salivary glands and the pancreas, neither can it
be regarded as a pancreatic flux with a regurgitation of the fluid from
the duodenum into the stomach and thence through the oesophagus into
the mouth, since during the nausea that must always attend the passage
of the intestinal contents into the stomach the pancreatic secretion is
arrested, and since the liquid contains salivary, and not pancreatic,
elements.The diarrhoea pancreatica is the least constant of all the objective
symptoms; in fact, constipation is present in many pancreatic
affections, notably carcinoma.The fecal evacuations in this condition
are frequent, thin, viscid, and contain an abundance of leucin.Under
the microscope the leucin appears either in the form of concentrically
sheathed globules, or as small crystalline rods and scales collected
together in the form of wheels or aggregated in clusters.This form of
diarrhoea may be attributed to a hypersecretion from the pancreas.That the presence of fat in the stools is an important diagnostic
symptom of pancreatic disease is proved both by clinical and
experimental observations.The characters of these stools vary
considerably.The fat may appear mixed with the feces in small lumps,
ranging in size from a pea to a hazelnut, yellowish-white in color,
soluble in aether, and easily melted and burned.Again, after the
evacuation has become cool fat may be seen covering the fecal masses,
collected into a thick cake around the edges of the containing vessel,
or, when the feces are liquid, floating as free oil on the surface.Finally, the fat may be in a crystalline form, the crystals being
needle-shaped and aggregated into sheaves and tufts.It may be present only in small quantities, or may
even be entirely absent from the evacuations in those cases in which
the secretion from the pancreas is simply diminished, and the amount is
greatest in those instances where there is a simultaneous arrest of the
pancreatic and hepatic secretions.It must be remembered, too, that
even in health the stools may contain fat; this occurs when an excess
of oleaginous food is consumed and after the administration of castor
oil or cod-liver oil.These conditions must be eliminated, therefore,
in estimating the value of fatty stools as a diagnostic symptom; if,
then, at the same time, coincident disease of the liver can be
excluded, the symptom becomes almost pathognomonic.The appearance of
fat in the stools may be due not only to an arrest of the pancreatic
secretion, but also to pressure upon the large lymphatic trunks,
interfering with the circulation of the chyle and checking the
absorption of fat from the intestine.Usually, the amount of fat expelled is in direct proportion to the
quantity consumed, but occasionally the former greatly exceeds the
latter.In such cases there must be some other source for the evacuated
fat than the food; and it is probable that fat from the adipose tissue
passes into the blood, and thence through the mesenteric vessels into
the intestine.This theory would likewise account in part for the rapid
and extreme wasting, and for another less frequently observed
symptom--namely, lipuria.A case is recorded by Clark of medullary
cancer of the pancreas with nutmeg liver, and another by Bowditch of
cancer of the pancreas and liver in which lipuria was noted.The fat
was observed, after the urine had cooled, floating about on the surface
in masses or globules; differing, {1116} therefore, from chyluria, for
in this condition the fat is present in the form of an emulsion, and
gives the urine either a uniform milk-like appearance, or, after it has
been allowed to stand, rests upon the surface in a creamy layer.When the pancreatic secretion is arrested, most of the animal food
which has escaped gastric digestion will pass unchanged through the
intestine and give rise to another characteristic condition of the
evacuations--namely, the presence in the feces of undigested striped
muscular fibres.The amount of these fibres, and indeed their
appearance at all in any given case, will depend directly upon the
nature of the food consumed.SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS.--The subjective symptoms of disease of the
pancreas are abnormal sensations in the epigastrium, and pain.The abnormal sensations in the epigastrium are weight and pressure,
attended at times by praecordial oppression and discomfort.The feeling
of weight is usually deep-seated, may be intermittent or constant, and
is generally increased or developed by pressure.It is often influenced
by position, the assumption of the erect posture or turning from side
to side giving rise to a stretching or dragging sensation, as if a
heavy body were falling downward or moving about in the upper abdomen.The pain may be due either to an inflammation of the peritoneum
covering the gland or to pressure upon the solar plexus, and
consequently varies in character.When it depends upon localized
peritonitis, it is constant, circumscribed, and deeply seated in the
epigastrium at a point midway between the tip of the ensiform cartilage
and the umbilicus; it is rather acute, and is greatly augmented by
pressure.The second variety occurs in paroxysms, and is neuralgic in
character, the sharp, excessively severe lancinating pains extending
from the epigastrium through to the back, upward into the thorax, and
downward into the abdomen.These paroxysms--in reality attacks of
coeliac neuralgia--are attended by great anxiety, restlessness, and
oppression and a tendency to syncope.That calculi in the duct of
Wirsung, tightly grasped at the position of arrest, may give rise to
paroxysms of pain analogous to biliary colic, cannot be doubted, though
there are no positive facts in support of this view.PRESSURE SYMPTOMS.--When the pancreas becomes enlarged it encroaches
upon the neighboring blood-vessels and viscera, interferes with their
functions, and thus produces prominent symptoms.The ductus choledochus from its close relation to the head of the gland
is especially liable to become obstructed, with the consequent
production of chronic jaundice and the general effects of the absence
of bile from the intestinal canal.Pressure upon the portal vein gives
rise to enlargement of the spleen; on the inferior cava, to oedema of
the feet and legs; and on the aorta, occasionally, to aneurismal
dilatation of the vessel above the point of obstruction and to
subsequent alteration in the size of the heart.By encroaching on the
stomach an enlarged pancreas may cause either displacement of the
viscus or stenosis at its pyloric extremity, attended with occasional
vomiting of large quantities of grumous, fermenting liquid, pain,
constipation, general failure of health, and the distinctive physical
signs of dilatation of the stomach.The duodenum may also be pressed
upon and more or less occluded, and pain and vomiting occur several
hours after food is taken.Occasionally hydronephrosis is {1117}
produced, the accumulation being usually in the right kidney and due to
obstruction of the corresponding ureter.A sufficient number of cases have been collected to show that there is
an intimate connection between disease of the pancreas and diabetes
mellitus.One or other condition may take the precedence, melituria
occurring during the progress of pancreatic disease, demonstrating the
onset of diabetes, and the appearance of fatty stools in diabetes a
secondary involvement of the pancreas.Various theories have been
advanced to account for this association, but the true explanation
seems to be based upon the experiments of Munk and Klebs.By
experimenting upon dogs these observers found that extirpation of the
solar plexus produced either permanent or temporary diabetes, whereas
section of the hepatic and splanchnic nerves, removal of the pancreas,
or ligature of the duct of Wirsung was without effect.From the
intimate anatomical relation of the pancreas to the solar plexus it is
easy to understand how disease of the gland may give rise to
alterations in the nerve-structure, either by direct pressure or by the
extension of inflammation along the nerve-fibres connecting the gland
with the ganglia; and these alterations in time produce diabetes.In
the instances in which diabetes is the primary affection the condition
of the pancreas, as proved by post-mortem section, is usually one of
simple or fatty atrophy; and it may be assumed that a lesion of the
solar plexus is the cause of both diseases, the changes in the pancreas
being produced in a similar way to the atrophy of the submaxillary
gland after section of the vaso-motor nerves in Bernard's experiments.The same nerve-lesion may give rise to bronzing of the skin, and two
cases are recorded in which disease of the pancreas (cheesy
infiltration, cancer) was attended by this symptom.PHYSICAL SIGNS.--To make a successful exploration of the pancreas the
stomach and colon should be as far as possible empty, and the patient
placed in a position, with the head and shoulders slightly elevated and
the thighs drawn up toward the belly, to relax the abdominal muscles;
or if necessary this relaxation must be brought about by the
administration of aether.The knee-elbow position is often preferable
to the dorsal position in practising palpation.The condition of the gland giving rise to physical signs is one of
enlargement, affecting chiefly and primarily its head, and due
generally to the presence of some morbid growth.Inspection reveals either a diffuse bulging of the upper third of the
abdomen to the right of the median line, or a well-defined tumor
situated beneath the right costal border, about the line of junction of
the right hypochondriac and epigastric regions.Often the pancreatic
tumor does not come in direct contact with the abdominal wall, but
presses against and thrusts forward the left lobe of the liver,
producing simply a prominence in the epigastrium.In the first
condition palpation elicits an ill-defined sense of resistance; in the
second, the fingers readily outline a tumor, which is slightly movable,
rounded in shape, firm or fluctuating, with a smooth or nodulated
surface, usually tender to the touch, and often giving a false impulse
transmitted from the aorta lying beneath; and in the third, the smooth
surface and the sharp edge of the left lobe of the liver are easily
distinguishable.{1118} Percussion over a pancreatic tumor is commonly dully-tympanitic,
absolute flatness occurring only when it is very large and comes
directly in contact with the abdominal wall, pushing aside the stomach
and intestines.On auscultation a blowing murmur may, in some instances, be heard over
the tumor.These murmurs are due to pressure upon the aorta, and must
be distinguished from the sound produced in aneurism of this vessel.The various complications of pancreatic disease, such as dilatation of
the stomach, ascites, and secondary lesions of the liver, greatly
modify the physical signs, and sometimes entirely prevent an
exploration of the gland.INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE PANCREAS.Acute Idiopathic Pancreatitis.It occurs most frequently in males during and
after adult life, and the strumous diathesis appears to predispose to
it.Intemperance, the suppression of normal or morbid discharges, and
traumatism act as exciting causes.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--The pathological changes may be divided into
two stages.In the first the gland is deep red in color, intensely
injected with blood, greatly increased in consistence, enlarged to the
extent of two or three times its normal size, and when an incision is
made the divided lobules feel firm and crisp.The interlobular tissue
is sometimes dotted with bloody points, and the same hemorrhagic
changes may occur in the connective tissue surrounding the gland.In
this stage resolution may occur or the inflammation may pass into
suppuration.At the beginning of the second, or suppurative, stage
numerous minute collections of pus are seen scattered throughout the
gland in the interacinous tissue; these gradually collect into a single
large abscess, and at times the whole gland is converted into a mere
pus-sac, the capsule being much thickened.In other instances the
formation of pus is entirely peripancreatic.The pus is usually
inodorous and creamy, but is sometimes grayish-white or greenish in
color; it then has a faint disagreeable odor, and occasionally is very
fetid.When mixed with pancreatic juice it becomes clear and yellowish
in color, and contains numerous minute curd-like masses.In the first stage secondary peritonitis may arise from a simple
extension of the inflammatory process, and bands of lymph are formed,
gluing the pancreas to the neighboring organs.In the second, fatal
acute peritonitis may result from the bursting of an abscess into the
peritoneal cavity.These abscesses also occasionally open into the
duodenum or stomach.Gangrene and peripancreatic sloughing occur very
exceptionally, and are probably due to extensive hemorrhagic changes.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--The disease may be preceded for an indefinite
period by symptoms of impaired gastric or intestinal digestion, but its
onset is usually sudden.The attack begins with colic or continuous
{1119} deep-seated pain, starting in the epigastrium and extending
toward the right shoulder or the back, and quickly becoming very
intense.The pain is attended by pallor of the face, great
restlessness, praecordial anxiety, dyspnoea, and faintness.The tongue
is furred or dry and red; thirst is increased; the appetite is lost;
there are frequent eructations, nausea, and constant vomiting of a
clear, greenish, viscid fluid; the vomiting produces no sense of
relief, and even increases the epigastric pain.The bowels are
obstinately constipated.The epigastric region is tense, tumid, and
excessively tender, so that it is usually impossible to elicit the
physical signs of enlargement of the gland.There is moderate pyrexia,
with evening exacerbations, and the pulse is increased in frequency.These symptoms progressively increase in severity, and reach their
maximum intensity in from three to five days.The pulse then becomes
small, compressible, and irregular, the extremities cold, the face
hippocratic, and death takes place in a state of collapse.The fatal
termination is preceded by the symptoms of acute peritonitis in the
cases which are complicated by an extension of inflammation or the
rupture of an abscess into the peritoneal cavity.Recovery is quite possible in the early stage of the disease.On the
other hand, the course may be greatly protracted by a change in the
type of the inflammation, resulting in induration and enlargement of
the gland or in the formation of chronic abscesses.Again, when
peritonitis from extension has been confined solely to the portion of
the peritoneum that covers the gland, and has resulted in the formation
of fibrinous bands binding the pancreas to the adjacent viscera, the
symptoms of pancreatitis will on subsiding give place to those of
obstruction of the stomach, duodenum, or bile-duct.DIAGNOSIS.--The diseases most likely to be confounded with acute
pancreatitis are biliary colic and the catarrhal form of acute
gastritis.From biliary colic it is distinguished by the absence of rigors,
jaundice, enlargement of the liver, and a tender pyriform tumor
corresponding in situation to the gall-bladder and due to its
distension with accumulated bile.The pain in both affections is sudden
in its onset, and very similar in character and distribution; but when
caused by the passage of a gall-stone it usually begins either after a
heavy meal or after some severe muscular exertion or shaking of the
body--circumstances inoperative in the production of the pain of
pancreatitis.The pain, too, in the former condition is less severe at
first, increases gradually in severity, is more paroxysmal, is at the
outset lessened by pressure, and is often temporarily relieved by the
act of vomiting.The attacks at the same time are rarely isolated, and
all doubt is removed when the pain ceases suddenly and a calculus is
discovered in the feces.Acute gastric catarrh is almost always traceable to the ingestion of
some irritant substance, usually alcohol or food of bad quality.This
history, together with the liability of the attack to occur during the
course of chronic dyspepsia, the comparatively trifling severity of the
pain, the headache, the irregularity of the bowels, the condition of
the urine, which is either high- or deposits lithates
abundantly, and the tendency of the affection to become chronic, are
the points of distinction between this and the pancreatic disease.{1120} Acute inflammation of the stomach, or gastritis proper,
resulting from corrosive poisons, presents a train of symptoms entirely
different from those of acute pancreatitis.TREATMENT.--Absolute rest is essential.The diet should consist of milk
guarded by lime-water and of meat-broths, this food being administered
in small quantities--one to two or three fluidounces of the milk and
lime-water or half as much broth--at proper intervals.In the early
stage an effort must be made to reduce the inflammation by the
application of ice to the epigastrium or of leeches to the same region,
or preferably to the anus.The excessive pain demands the free use of
opium.The nausea and vomiting may be relieved to some extent by
directing the patient to swallow small lumps of ice, and by the
employment of iced carbonic-acid water and the effervescing draught;
and the tendency to constipation may be overcome by enemata.Later in
the course of the disease, if the epigastric tenderness permits of it,
light linseed poultices should be placed over the upper abdomen.During
the stage of collapse alcoholic stimulants and the application of heat
to the extremities are necessary.The occurrence of acute peritonitis
or other complications and sequelae demand appropriate treatment.In this condition the pancreas may be the seat of either acute
parenchymatous inflammation or of metastatic abscesses.Acute parenchymatous degeneration of the muscles, kidneys, liver, and
so on is recognized as a frequent lesion in the acute infectious
diseases, particularly typhoid fever; and it is under these
circumstances, and in association always with similar changes in some
of the organs mentioned, that parenchymatous degeneration of the
pancreas takes place.Metastatic suppurative inflammation is very rare: it has been observed
in cases of disease of the testicles after the operation of extirpation
of these organs, and occasionally in puerperal peritonitis.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--In parenchymatous inflammation the gland at
first is hardened, swollen, and reddened, and on section presents a
reddish-gray surface, with indistinctness of the glandular structure,
due to the amount of swelling of the acini.Under the microscope the
gland-cells are found to be enlarged; they contain several nuclei,
their protoplasm is infiltrated with fatty granules, obscuring the
nuclei to a certain extent, and their outline is well defined.These
alterations are most marked in the head of the gland.After a time the
hypertrophy of the cells, by pressing upon the blood-vessels, produces
an anaemic condition and the organ becomes pale; in the advanced stages
softening occurs.Metastatic suppurative inflammation leads to the formation of a single
large abscess or to multiple minute purulent collections.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--Parenchymatous degeneration gives rise to no
distinctive symptoms.Its occurrence in typhoid fever or other
infectious disease may be suspected when after prolonged hyperpyrexia
there are enlargement of the liver and spleen and albuminuria.The
appearance of jaundice (from pressure) increases the probability of
involvement of the pancreas in the general gland-change.{1121} The development of rigors, alternating with flushing, during the
course of one of the lesions liable to be attended with metastatic
abscesses in the pancreas might suggest the formation of pus in the
gland, but an absolute diagnosis is impossible.Several cases are on record pointing to the possibility of a metastasis
of mumps from the parotid gland to the pancreas.In these the
disappearance of the parotiditis was followed by symptoms resembling
those of idiopathic pancreatitis--namely, thirst, fever, loss of
appetite, anxiety, and burning in the epigastrium, with deep-seated
pain extending toward the right side; in addition there was diarrhoea,
with numerous, yellowish, watery stools.In one case that resulted
fatally the secondary diarrhoea suddenly ceased and the parotid
swelling reappeared.At the autopsy the pancreas was found to be
swollen, reddened, engorged with blood, and indurated.Such a
metastasis, however, must be very infrequent, and more extended
observations are necessary to establish its course and clinical
features.The first form of acute secondary pancreatitis may be a comparatively
unimportant complication of the acute infectious diseases, or, together
with the parenchymatous degeneration of other organs, may form a
distinct element in the fatal issue of these diseases.Metastatic abscesses are prone to be followed by ulceration and the
formation of fistulous communications with the neighboring viscera.TREATMENT.--The management of secondary inflammation of the pancreas is
regulated solely by the indications derived from the originating
disease.Inflammation of the connective tissue of the gland usually occurs after
adult life, and depends upon a variety of causes.The secondary form, due to long-continued venous engorgement resulting
from lesions of the cardiac valves and from chronic disease of the
lungs or liver, is the most frequently observed.Other causes are closure of the duct of Wirsung, the retained secretion
producing pressure upon the glandular tissue; the extension of
inflammation from adjacent organs, as the bile-duct when there is an
impacted gall-stone, or the stomach and duodenum, especially in cancer
and perforating ulcer, where the floor of the ulcer is formed by the
pancreas; the pressure of tumors, as aneurisms of the abdominal aorta
and coeliac axis; chronic alcoholism; and syphilis.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--The lesion may be limited to the head or to
isolated portions of the gland, or be uniformly distributed.The
general changes are a hyperplasia of the interacinous connective
tissue, with subsequent contraction and atrophy, or, in extreme
instances, entire destruction of the glandular elements proper, the
organ becoming granular and firmer and tougher than normal.A section
shows a pale surface, studded at intervals with white spots, from which
little cheese-like and fatty masses may be squeezed, and, when there
has been intense hyperaemia, with minute collections of reddish pigment
and small hemorrhagic cysts, indicating previous interstitial
hemorrhages.{1122} When the contraction causes closure of the small excretory ducts
or of the duct of Wirsung itself, the section shows secondary cysts and
beaded canals.In exceptional instances of acquired syphilis the pancreas is the seat
of gummata or sclerosis, but in congenital syphilis hyperplasia of the
glandular connective tissue frequently occurs, being usually associated
with specific lesions of the lungs, liver, kidneys, and general
glandular system.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--As chronic pancreatitis rarely attains a
sufficient degree of development to interfere seriously with the
function of the organ, the disease is usually latent, or masked by the
symptoms of the originating lesion in secondary hyperplasia, or by the
associated diseases of the abdominal viscera in alcoholism and acquired
syphilis.When due to hereditary syphilis, the foetus is stillborn or death takes
place soon after birth, and there are no characteristic symptoms.Occasionally, however, especially when it depends upon a complete
obstruction of the duct of Wirsung, a diagnosis may be made from the
presence of emaciation, fatty stools, and melituria, with epigastric
pain of a neuralgic character, and the discovery of a deep-seated,
dense tumor extending transversely across the epigastrium.The duration is indefinite, and varies greatly with the cause.While a
return to the healthy condition is possible during the early stage of
the lesion, the usual course is similar to that of chronic interstitial
inflammation in other organs.TREATMENT.--The management, when a diagnosis can be made, must be
guided mainly by the etiological indications.The restoration of the
functions of the heart, lungs, or liver when these organs are at fault,
the abstinence from alcohol in the drunkard, and an energetic use of
mercurials or iodide of potassium in syphilis, are of the first
importance in arresting the disease.A persistent course of mild
purgatives and of cathartic mineral waters is serviceable.Pain should
be relieved by belladonna or opium.The diet must be simple and
digestible, and if an arrest of the pancreatic secretion be indicated
by the appearance of fat in the stools, an effort should be made to
supply the deficiency.For this purpose pancreatin, prepared by
precipitation by alcohol from a watery extract of a calf's or pig's
pancreas, may be used.[1] The pancreatin may be given in doses of from
five to fifteen grains, in the form of a pill or in capsules, and at an
interval of two hours after food is taken, or the same quantity of
pancreatin may be added to the food a few moments before it is eaten.Probably the best substitute is a watery infusion of the gland
containing all its soluble principles.To prepare an active infusion
the pancreas must be taken from the animal during the act of digestion.It is then freed from its surrounding fat, and macerated for two hours
in four times its weight of water at a temperature ranging between 25
degrees and 30 degrees C.(58.3 degrees and 61.1 degrees F.).Another
plan is to beat a calf's pancreas in a mortar with six fluidounces of
water until a milk-like fluid is obtained, and strain.One-third of the
infusion obtained by either method is administered after each meal, an
entire pancreas being thus used every twenty-four hours.[Footnote 1: One gramme of pancreatin is sufficient to emulsify fifteen
grammes of fatty substances, to convert eight grammes of starch into
glucose, to digest fifty grammes of fibrin, twenty grammes of
syntonine, and thirty-three grammes of boiled albumen (Raymond).]{1123} The extractum pancreatis,[2] as it is now furnished to the
profession, is a very useful preparation.It may be employed to
peptonize milk, milk-gruel, and broth, or be given in combination with
bicarbonate of sodium at a fixed interval after each meal, as in the
following formula:

  Rx.pancreatis,    drachm j;
      Sodii bicarbonatis, drachm ij;
  M. et.S. One powder to be taken two hours after each meal.[Footnote 2: That prepared by Fairchild Brothers & Foster of New York
has proved the best in my hands.]Peptonized milk is prepared by putting into a clean quart bottle 5
grains of extractum pancreatis, 15 grains of bicarbonate of sodium, and
a gill of cool water; shake, and add a pint of fresh cool milk.Place
the bottle in water not so hot but that the whole hand can be held in
it without discomfort for a minute, and keep the bottle there for
exactly thirty minutes.At the end of that time put the bottle on ice
to check further digestion and keep the milk from spoiling.Peptonized milk-gruel is made of equal parts of any farinaceous gruel
and fresh cold milk.To a pint of this combination 5 grains of
extractum pancreatis and 15 grains of bicarbonate of sodium are added,
and the whole allowed to stand in a warm place for thirty minutes, when
the process of digestion must be arrested by placing on ice.Peptonized broth is made in the following way: Take one-fourth of a
pound of finely-minced raw lean beef or mutton or chicken, and one-half
pint of cold water; cook over a slow fire, stirring constantly, until
it has boiled a few minutes.Then pour off the liquor, beat the meat to
a paste, and put both into a bottle with a half pint of cold water.Add
30 grains of extractum pancreatis and 20 grains of bicarbonate of
sodium; shake well, and set in a warm place (110-115 degrees) for three
hours, shaking occasionally; then boil quickly.Finally, strain or
clarify in the usual way and season to taste.MORBID GROWTHS OF THE PANCREAS.Cancer is probably the most common of the chronic affections of the
pancreas.It is usually secondary, being due to an extension of
carcinoma of the stomach, duodenum, liver, or abdominal lymphatic
glands, but there are enough cases on record to show that it may be
primary.It has been discovered in the foetus at birth, but the vast
majority of cases occur after the age of forty.Nothing is known as to the influence of inherited
tendency in the production of the disease, and as little of the
exciting causes, though some authors attach much importance to
prolonged pressure upon the epigastrium and to blows and contusions on
the upper part of the abdomen.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--Primary carcinoma may be either {1124}
scirrhous, encephaloid, or colloid, the first being the variety most
frequently observed.The lesion begins in the head of the gland in the form of several small
nodules which gradually coalesce.Sometimes the whole gland becomes
involved in the new formation; again, isolated nodules may be scattered
throughout its substance, and exceptionally the growth is limited to
the tail or middle portion.When the head alone is involved, the
remainder of the gland either remains healthy, undergoes fatty
degeneration, or becomes indurated.The tumor is rounded in outline and
nodular, and varies in size, density, and color according to the form
of carcinoma present.The duct of Wirsung is ordinarily obstructed,
large retention cysts, containing a yellowish-red liquid, are formed,
and the changes already described under the head of Chronic
Interstitial Pancreatitis take place in those portions of the gland
which are free from carcinoma.The disease is very prone to extend to
the surrounding organs, particularly the neighboring lymphatic glands,
the duodenum, and the liver, rarely to the stomach.When the contiguous
organs are not directly implicated in the carcinomatous changes, they
are subjected to pressure by the tumor, and in the case of the stomach
and duodenum adhesions often form, and are followed by perforation.There seems to be a tendency also to infiltration of the adjacent
subperitoneal connective tissue and to hyperplasia of the fibrous
tissue of the viscera, even when they are not secondarily involved in
the morbid growth, leading to narrowing of the aorta, thickening of the
walls of the stomach and duodenum, and a sclerosis of the liver.Obstruction of the common bile-duct, with dilatation of the
gall-bladder from retention of bile, is a frequent result of the
disease.Secondary carcinoma of the pancreas usually first appears in, and is
limited to, the head of the gland.It seldom occurs in isolated
nodules, but the growth is generally continuous with the primary
cancerous mass.The form is either scirrhous or encephaloid.Wagner
records a case of cylindrical-celled epithelioma following a simple
epithelioma of the mucous membrane of the duodenum; and a similar
instance has come under the author's own observation;[3] but this
variety of morbid growth is rare.The primary growth is almost
uniformly situated in the stomach, duodenum, liver, or gall-bladder,
though occasionally it may be seated in some distant organ; in such
cases the pancreatic tumor appears as an isolated nodular mass.[Footnote 3: _Transactions of the Pathological Society of
Philadelphia_, vol.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--The symptoms may be divided into two
classes--namely, first, those which arise from the lesion of the gland
itself; and, secondly, those which depend upon the effect of this
lesion on the neighboring viscera.The features belonging to the first class are general marasmus, pain,
the appearance of fat and perhaps undigested muscular fibres in the
fecal evacuations and of fat in the urine, and the physical signs of an
abdominal tumor.Loss of flesh is one of the earliest symptoms: it is generally
progressive, and is at times so great that the spine can be distinctly
traced through the abdominal walls.Together with this emaciation there
is debility, often extreme, but sometimes not so marked as might be
expected from the degree of wasting.The skin is commonly pale and dry,
and before jaundice is {1125} developed has the ordinary sallow hue of
cancerous cachexia.The features are pinched, and the face wears an
expression of anxiety and suffering.In cases uncomplicated by
peritoneal inflammation the temperature remains about normal, or it may
be lowered as the general exhaustion increases.The pulse is feeble and
slightly increased in frequency.Pain is the most uniformly present and the earliest symptom.It is
always situated deep in the epigastrium, and from thence extends to the
back, to the right or left side, downward to the umbilicus or lower
part of the abdomen, and upward into the chest.It is generally
continuous, but is subject to remissions and paroxysmal exacerbations.During the remissions sensations of distress, of burning, or of dull
pain are experienced at the pit of the stomach; during the
exacerbations, which may last several days, the pain becomes extremely
acute and lancinating and extended in distribution.The ingestion of
food and pressure upon the epigastrium have no constant effect upon the
pain.Quick movements of the body from side to side often increase it
and excite exacerbations.The suffering is greatest in the erect
posture, and on this account the patient bends his body forward so as
to relax the abdominal muscles.The paroxysmal and neuralgic character
of the pain indicates implication of the coeliac plexus.The appearance of fat in the stools is an important symptom, unless
there be at the same time an obstruction to the passage of bile into
the duodenum, indicated by jaundice.Lipuria has been noticed in a few
cases only.In many instances (nearly one-half of the number of recorded cases)
physical exploration reveals the signs of enlargement of the organ.At
times there is merely a sense of fulness and resistance to the touch,
and a modified tympanitic percussion note in one of the three regions
of the upper segment of the abdomen.But usually when a tumor is
present it is readily mapped out by palpation.The tumor is seated in
the epigastrium, and may extend into the right or left hypochondrium or
downward into the umbilical region.It varies much in size, is rounded,
nodulated, firm, slightly movable or fixed, and tender, though
sometimes painless, to the touch.Percussion yields dulness or a
dull-tympanitic sound.On auscultation a blowing murmur may be heard
when the tumor presses upon the aorta; and when this murmur is present
there is usually also transmitted pulsation.The symptoms belonging to the second class arise when the adjacent
viscera become involved in the cancerous disease, or when their
functional activity is disturbed by the encroachment and pressure of
the enlarged pancreas.From the association of a catarrhal condition of the mucous membrane of
the stomach, particularly when the pyloric orifice is obstructed,
several prominent symptoms of gastric catarrh are frequently
observed--namely, sialorrhoea, pyrosis, acid eructations, flatulence,
abnormal sensations, such as burning, weight and oppression in the
epigastrium after taking food, and increased thirst.The tongue varies
in appearance: it may be dry and covered with a brown or yellow fur,
but when the flow of saliva is increased it is peculiarly clean and
moist; and this condition is rather characteristic.The appetite is
also variable; sometimes it remains good {1126} until the end, and
occasionally it is perverted.Hiccough in some cases is an obstinate
and annoying symptom.Nausea and vomiting are late but moderately constant features.Their
relation to the ingestion of food is not fixed.The vomited matter may
consist of food, of glairy mucus more or less tinged with bile, of
colorless liquid, or of a fluid resembling a mixture of bran and water.If there is marked pyloric obstruction with dilatation of the stomach,
large quantities of frothy and fermenting material containing sarcina
ventriculi are rejected at intervals.In the rare cases in which
secondary sarcoma of the viscus is developed the ejecta are bloody or
have the coffee-ground appearance, and the vomiting occurs several
hours after eating, as the new growth is generally situated at the
pylorus.When there is adhesion of the pancreatic tumor to the stomach,
with perforation, both blood and pus are vomited.Dilatation of the
stomach is attended by prominence of the epigastrium and an extended
area of gastric tympany, and in cancer of the pylorus a tumor is often
appreciable on palpation.The fecal
evacuations are hard, and when the biliary secretion is absent from the
intestine they are clay-, and often contain fat.When there is
ulceration of the mucous membrane of the duodenum following secondary
cancer or adhesion, the stools become black and tar-like from the
presence of altered blood.Complete obstipation occurs in mechanical
obstruction of the gut from direct pressure or from bands of lymph.Occasionally, just before death there is diarrhoea, and there may be an
alternation of vomiting and diarrhoea.The symptoms and signs of secondary carcinoma or sclerosis of the liver
may be present, but the most commonly observed indications of impaired
hepatic function depend upon pressure-obstruction of the common
bile-duct.These are jaundice, fatty and clay- stools, and the
appearance of a tumor in the region of the gall-bladder.Jaundice is a
very common symptom.It occurs late in the disease as a rule, is
progressive and persistent, resisting all treatment, and is extreme in
degree, the skin becoming deep-yellow or greenish in color.The tumor
of the distended gall-bladder is pyriform in shape, firm and elastic to
the touch, yields a dull percussion sound, and occupies a position
opposite the extremity of the tenth rib on the right side of the
abdomen.Dropsy occurs in a large proportion of cases (nearly one-half) during
the advanced stages of the disease.It is due to vascular obstruction
occasioned by the pressure of the enlarged pancreas itself or of the
secondarily degenerated coeliac glands, and finally by secondary
lesions of the liver.The dropsy appears either in the form of ascites
or anasarca, is not often extreme in degree, and is subject to
variations, disappearing and reappearing at intervals.Ascites is the
more common form, but both conditions may exist in the same patient.It is impossible in the majority of instances to definitely fix the
date of onset of a pancreatic cancer, but the average duration of the
disease may be stated to be about one year.The uniformly fatal
termination usually takes place slowly from gradual exhaustion or with
the symptoms of an adynamic fever, but death may occur suddenly from
hemorrhage.DIAGNOSIS.--The principal features of carcinoma of the pancreas are
extreme emaciation, loss of strength, dyspepsia, pain of a neuralgic
{1127} character in the epigastrium, constipation, obstinate jaundice,
moderate ascites or anasarca, the appearance of fat in the stools,
lipuria, occasional vomiting, and the physical signs of an epigastric
tumor.These symptoms are not pathognomonic, however, and the diagnosis can be
certainly established only when it is possible to exclude primary
disease of the surrounding organs, especially of the stomach and liver.Cancer of the stomach may be excluded by the less-marked character of
the functional disturbances of the viscus; by the absence of frequent
vomiting, haematemesis, and the rejection of coffee-ground material; by
the somewhat different situation and greater immobility of the tumor,
by the seat, distribution, and constancy of the pain; and by the
presence of jaundice and of fat in the stools and urine.Diseases of the liver attended with alterations in the size of the
organ, as cancer, abscess, albuminoid and fatty degeneration, sclerosis
and hydatid tumor, have sufficiently characteristic physical signs and
symptoms to be readily distinguished from cancer of the pancreas.On
the other hand, the tumor of an enlarged gall-bladder is often
confusing.The situation of this tumor opposite the tenth rib and its
pyriform shape are important; other distinguishing points depend upon
the cause of the enlargement.In enlargement from accumulated bile the
tumor is elastic and fluctuating; from accumulation of gall-stones,
hard and nodulated, movable, painless on palpation, and often the seat
of crackling fremitus, produced by manipulation and due to the rubbing
together of several calculi; from cancer, hard, nodular, the size of an
orange, tender on pressure, rapid in growth, preceded by attacks of
biliary colic, and attended by fistulous communications with the
intestines and the passage of gall-stones per anum.In aneurism of the aorta or coeliac axis the tumor may present in the
epigastrium and produce analogous pressure symptoms.But the pain is
more of the character described as wearing, and is usually augmented at
night: on grasping the tumor a uniform expanding pulsation is felt in
place of the to-and-fro movement appreciable in a tumor resting upon a
healthy blood-vessel and receiving a transmitted impulse, while the
constitutional symptoms and course are quite different.The tumor of malignant disease of the omentum, although it appears in
the epigastrium or upper part of the umbilical region, is much more
movable, and is accompanied by ill-defined symptoms very dissimilar to
those of pancreatic cancer.In cancer of the transverse colon the mass may occupy nearly the same
position as a pancreatic growth, but the pain occurs several hours
after food is taken; vomiting is absent, and there is frequently
hemorrhage from the bowels.Chronic pancreatitis is accompanied by symptoms simulating those of
cancer; the enlargement of the gland, however, is not so great, nor are
the indications of pressure upon adjacent organs so prominent.The pain
is less severe, the general failure in health more gradual, the
progress slower, and constipation less common.TREATMENT.--The indications are to maintain the strength of the
patient, to provide a diet that is nutritious and at the same time
easily digested, to allay pain by the employment of narcotics, and to
relieve as far as possible the various symptoms as they arise.The plan
of {1128} administering a calf's pancreas or extractum pancreatis will
prove serviceable when the fecal evacuations contain fat.Nutritious
and peptonized enemata may be of service in some cases.Sarcoma and Tubercle of the Pancreas.Sarcoma of the pancreas occurs with extreme rarity.It is impossible
during life to distinguish it from carcinoma.Tubercle of the gland is infrequently met with.Some pathologists deny
its occurrence, and believe that the cases recorded as such are merely
instances of caseous degeneration of the neighboring glands.When it
does occur, it is always secondary, the primary disease being situated
in the lungs or intestines.The alterations in the gland consist in the
development of cheesy masses or of miliary granulations in the
connective tissue between the acini.The condition gives rise to no
definite symptoms, and its diagnosis during life is impossible.DEGENERATIONS OF THE PANCREAS.Two forms of fatty degeneration occur, either separately or
combined--namely, fatty infiltration and fatty metamorphosis.Fatty infiltration consists of a true hypertrophy of the fat-tissue
normally existing in the gland, or of an increase and extension into
the gland of the peripancreatic adipose tissue.Yellow bands and masses
of fat-tissue appear between the acini, and by constantly increasing in
size lead gradually to a total atrophy of the cells of the acini.The
canal of Wirsung contains a fatty liquid.These changes are found
associated with fatty liver, heart, and omentum, in drunkards
especially.Fatty metamorphosis of the gland consists of a change analogous to
fatty metamorphosis of other organs.When hyperplasia of the
interstitial connective tissue is absent, the organ is flaccid, soft,
and diminished in size; the acinous structure remains distinct, though
the acini and ducts are filled with a fatty emulsion: after this is
discharged or absorbed the gland appears as a flaccid band, and finally
becomes entirely atrophied.Fatty metamorphosis occurs in drunkards, in
diabetes, in advanced age, in cancer, phthisis, and other wasting
diseases.Neither form of fatty disease gives rise to symptoms by which it can be
recognized during life.Albuminoid Degeneration of the Pancreas.This is only found in combination with amyloid change in other organs
of the body, and a diagnosis cannot be made.{1129} Hemorrhages into the Pancreas.Hemorrhages into the pancreas may be divided into three classes.The most common form depends upon passive hyperaemia, the result of
chronic diseases of the heart, lungs, or liver.In this condition the
effusion of blood coexists with chronic inflammatory changes in the
interstitial connective tissue.The appearance at first is of minute
bloody points scattered throughout the areolar tissue; later, these
change into round or oval pigment masses, or spaces containing reddish
serum and surrounded by thickened, rust-, irregular walls.The second class includes the rare cases of hemorrhage resulting from
the rupture of one of the large blood-vessels of the gland, and due to
some pre-existing change in the vessel walls.In these the pancreas is
enlarged, may be converted into a sac containing blood, either fluid or
coagulated or partially crystallized according to the duration of life
after the hemorrhage has taken place, and a ruptured blood-vessel may
be readily discovered on dissection.The condition in which, without any evidence of passive hyperaemia or
gross vascular lesion, the entire pancreas become hemorrhagic,
constitutes the third class.The gland is then dark-red or violet in
color, the meshes of the interstitial tissue are filled with recent or
altered blood, and the acini are stained of a dull-gray hue.The
hemorrhage may extend to the connective tissue surrounding the gland.Finally, the organ becomes soft, the peritoneal covering sloughs, and
fragments of broken-down gland-tissue escape into the peritoneal
cavity.These lesions are so analogous to those which attend thrombosis
occurring in other organs that their dependence upon the same cause
seems probable.The first form of hemorrhage is unattended by special symptoms.In the
second a pulsating tumor may suddenly appear in the epigastrium, and
the ordinary indications of hemorrhage--vomiting, fainting fits, cold
extremities, feeble pulse, and general exhaustion--are present.Death
may occur suddenly or the patient may linger on for months.In the
third condition death usually occurs very suddenly, probably from
pressure upon the sympathetic ganglia.There are no symptoms, and the
rapid termination prevents the development of general peritonitis,
which would otherwise occur from the sloughing of the peritoneum.OBSTRUCTION OF THE PANCREATIC DUCT.Obstruction of the excretory duct is a frequent occurrence in
pancreatic disease, and is due to two classes of causes--namely, 1st,
pressure from without; and, 2d, closure of the canal by catarrhal
swelling of its mucous membrane or by calculi.In the first class may be placed obstruction depending upon contraction
occurring in sclerosis of the gland, upon carcinoma of the head of the
gland, upon peripancreatic adhesions and indurations, upon the {1130}
presence of large gall-stones in the ductus choledochus, and upon
carcinoma of the pylorus and duodenum and enlargement of the
neighboring lymphatic glands.In catarrh of the canal of Wirsung the obstruction results either from
simple swelling of the mucous membrane or from the presence of a plug
of tough mucus.The formation of pancreatic concretions is by no means a rare event,
though these calculi are met with far less frequently than either
gall-stones or salivary concretions.They result from precipitation of
the inorganic ingredients of the pancreatic juice, and are usually
seated in the main duct, although they may be situated in the smaller
branches.They may be single or multiple, as many as twenty having been
counted in one gland.In shape they are spherical, oval, or branched,
with sometimes a smooth, at others a spiculated, surface; their size
varies from that of a minute granule to a small walnut; they are
usually white or grayish-white in color, but may be black; and are
composed of the carbonate of lime or of a combination of the carbonate
and phosphate with oxalate of lime.Coincidently with these calculi it
is common to find concretions in the kidneys and gall-bladder.Concretions composed of insoluble protein substances have also been
found in the pancreatic ducts (Virchow).The most probable causes of the formation of pancreatic calculi seem to
be catarrhal conditions of the mucous membrane of the ducts and an
alteration in the chemical composition of the secretion.Whatever the cause, the obstruction, when complete, leads to retention
of the secretion and the formation of retention cysts.When the obstruction is situated at the duodenal extremity of the duct,
the canal and its secondary branches are either uniformly dilated or
sacculi are formed.These sacculi are round or oval, vary greatly in
size, sometimes reaching the dimensions of the fist or of a child's
head; they may be single, or several of them may be present, differing
in size and causing irregular projections of the outer surface of the
gland.When the obstruction occurs at some point in the course of the
duct, the dilatations and sacculi are found only behind the point of
occlusion.The small cysts contain a fluid resembling the pancreatic
juice; the larger, a whitish, chalky fluid, which in old cases may
contain white friable concretions composed of carbonate and phosphate
of lime, and become purulent, or be stained bright red or
chocolate- from the occurrence of hemorrhage.In such instances
haematoidin crystals can be discovered by the microscope.The interior
of the dilated ducts and of the retention cysts is lined by a single
layer of thin flat cells, with irregular edges and with oval flat
nuclei.The walls are thickened, and composed of superimposed layers of
laminated connective tissue separated from one another by flat
nucleated cells.The secreting structure of the gland undergoes atrophy
from pressure, or fatty metamorphosis takes place, and, although the
gland is increased in size from the presence of the cysts, its
functional power is lost.In addition to causing obstruction of the duct of Wirsung and the
changes mentioned, pancreatic calculi may produce induration, atrophy,
acute inflammation, or even suppuration of the surrounding glandular
tissue.{1131} SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--The main feature is the presence in the
epigastrium of a rounded, smooth, fluctuating, painless tumor.There
are also indications of the absence of the pancreatic secretion from
the digestive tract--notably, emaciation, general debility, and the
appearance of fat in the stools.Jaundice resulting from a coincident
obstruction of the bile-duct is a frequent symptom, and melituria has
been noted in some cases.It is probable, too, that the passage of a
calculus along the duct may give rise to pain resembling in character
and distribution the pain of hepatic colic.Sometimes the termination is sudden from
the rupture of a cyst into the peritoneal cavity or into the stomach or
duodenum, with hemorrhage.DIAGNOSIS.--The absence of pain, of tenderness, and of cachexia,
together with the physical characters of the tumor, distinguishes it
from carcinoma of the gland.Though not likely to be confounded with this disease, both hydatid
tumor of the liver and distension of the gall-bladder must be borne in
mind in making the diagnosis of a fluctuating tumor situated in the
upper third of the abdomen.TREATMENT must be entirely symptomatic.Attention to the general
health, proper regulation of the diet, and the employment of pancreatin
or an infusion of calf's pancreas to supply the place of the deficient
pancreatic juice, are the important steps.Attacks of pancreatic colic
indicate the use of anodynes.In two reported cases in which the cysts were very large paracentesis
for the removal of the fluid contents was resorted to, and there are
two cases on record in which the cysts were extirpated after abdominal
section.Kulenhampff of Bremen records a case of a man, thirty-nine
years of age, in whom, after a succession of severe blows upon the
abdomen, a tumor appeared in the epigastrium.An exploratory incision
was made, and a few ounces of pancreatic fluid evacuated by aspiration.Six days afterward the abdomen was opened, the peritoneum united to the
incision, and antiseptic gauze inserted to produce adhesive
inflammation between the sac and the abdominal wall.Adhesion taking
place after four days, the cyst was opened, a liter of fluid evacuated,
a tent inserted, and an antiseptic dressing applied.For sixteen days
fluid constantly escaped in slowly diminishing quantities, and the
tumor disappeared, a fistulous tract remaining.This completely closed
under the use of tincture of iodine and nitrate of silver at the end of
the seventh week.Thiersch opened a pancreatic cyst and evacuated three
liters of chocolate- fluid; recovery with a fistula followed.From a patient supposed to be suffering from ovarian dropsy Rokitansky
partially extirpated a cyst connected with the tail of the pancreas;
death from suppurative peritonitis occurred on the tenth day.N. Bozeman[4] on December 2, 1880, successfully removed from a woman
forty-one years old a pancreatic cyst weighing, with its contents,
twenty and a half pounds.In this instance also the operation was
undertaken for the removal of a supposed ovarian tumor, the diagnosis
not being established until after the abdomen was opened.[Footnote 4: _New York Medical Record_, Jan.{1132}

PERITONITIS.BY ALONZO CLARK, M.D., LL.D.Italian physicians in the later years of the seventeenth century and in
the early ones of the eighteenth had acquired some knowledge of the
symptoms of the disease we now call peritonitis, but known to them as
inflammation of the intestines.Indeed, it is claimed by some of the
admirers of Hippocrates that there are passages in his writings that
indicate some knowledge of the disease.But this claim will probably be
always received with many doubts as to its validity.In confirmation of the first statement I will transcribe certain
passages from Morgagni's thirty-fifth letter: In inflammation of the
intestines "Albertini had observed the pulse to be low and rather weak,
such as you will find it to have been in general in the foregoing
letter under Nos.He also observed the abdomen to
be tense and hard, the face and eyes to have something unusual in their
appearance."Medical writers, indeed, agree in the tension of the
abdomen, but they add many other symptoms, which prove beyond a doubt
the intestines to be inflamed; yet they mean that evident inflammation
which all may easily ascertain, and not that obscure disorder which we
now speak of, and which few suspect" (gangrene of the intestines)."By
the same writers it is also supposed that there is an obstinate
costiveness and continual vomiting."Morgagni refers to the assistance rendered by Albertini, Valsala, Van
Swieten, Rosa, and others in elucidating this subject.It is singular,
considering the clearness of his perception of the symptoms of
inflammation of the intestines, that he should be so greatly confused
regarding gangrene and sphacelus of the same parts.He looks on these
as the result of inflammation, and when the two classes of cases are
considered and compared, the result is a contrast and not a
resemblance.Yet he supposes that the differences are to be accounted
for by the different modes in which the same disease may be developed
in different persons.Another thing obtrudes itself on the attention in these letters: that
while a number of post-mortem examinations are reported of those who
had died of inflammation of the intestines, of gangrene and sphacelus
of the intestines, of hepatic abscess opening into the peritoneal
cavity, there is no record of finding in the abdomen anything
corresponding to what is now known as the inflammatory effusions from
serous membranes.I have searched his works, not for {1133}
peritonitis, for the word was not in use in his day, but for some
account of inflammation of the intestines or of some disease in the
description of which symptoms are named that distinguish or belong to
peritonitis, and with the single exception of pain the search has been
fruitless.Cullen in 1775 mentions the disease, but says that so little is known
about it that he will not attempt a description of it.Bichat died in 1802 in the thirty-eighth year of his age.I am not able
at present to lay my hand on his _Pathological Anatomy_; I therefore
quote from Chomel's article on peritonitis in the _Dictionnaire de
Medecine_ to show his claim to important studies regarding that
disease: "For a long time peritonitis was confounded under the name of
inflammation du bas ventre with inflammations of the abdominal viscera;
and it is to Bichat belongs the merit of having proved that
inflammation of the peritoneum is a disease distinct, and that it ought
to be separated from enteritis, gastritis, etc., as pleurisy is
separate from pneumonia.The studies of Gasc and of Laennec soon
confirmed the opinion of Bichat, and assured to peritonitis the
important place which it ought to occupy in all nosological tables.It
has become since then a subject of numerous observations and of
interesting researches regarding the causes de sa marche and the
lesions it causes."The references are not given by Chomel, but they are probably these:
Laennec, _Histoire des Inflammations du Peritoine_, 1804; and Gasc,
_Dictionnaire des Sciences Med._, p.Gasc says that the twenty years next preceding his publication
witnessed the first stage of the true history of peritonitis.Walther
in 1786 had contributed some facts, and S. G. Vogel in 1795, but the
rounding off and completing their work was left for Bichat.MORBID ANATOMY.--The first thing that strikes the observer in the
post-mortem examination of a person who has died of this disease is the
tendency of the intestines to protrude through the cut made in the
abdominal wall.This is produced by their dilatation generally, both
small and large, by gas.No gas, under these circumstances, ever
escapes from the peritoneal cavity unless there has been perforation of
the alimentary canal somewhere.While the intestines are in this manner
dilated, the stomach is small and usually empty.On the surface of the intestines there will be found a layer of
coagulated fibrin, often very thin and delicate, requiring a scraping
of the surface of the peritoneum to demonstrate it, but commonly
obvious enough, and sometimes quite abundant.This same false membrane
can be found on the viscera covered by the peritoneal membrane, on its
anterior extension, and most at the point of contact of one coil of the
intestine with another.Incorporated with this new membrane or lying
under it will often be seen blood-spots, thin, translucent, diffused,
and having ill-defined boundaries.The blood-vessels themselves are not remarkably congested.Here and
there may be spots where some redness remains, and the vessels are
larger than natural.But the congestion and redness, which analogy
leads us to {1134} believe belong to the active stages of the disease,
have in great degree disappeared after death.The peritoneal membrane itself has hardly become thickened, certainly
not in marked degree, but it has lost its lustrous surface, is, at
least in parts, of an opaline color, as if it had absorbed diluted
milk, and there is an effusion of serum or slight oedema on its
attached surface.Whatever may be the popular opinion regarding the
termination of inflammation of the bowels in mortification, whatever
the opinion of the older physicians, it is safe to say that gangrene of
the peritoneum has never been the result of uncomplicated, diffuse,
acute peritonitis.Peritonitis from strangulation of the intestine or
analogous causes is of course excepted.But in puerperal peritonitis I
have noticed a fact to which I have nowhere seen an allusion.The
parietal peritoneum is at two points in the abdomen but loosely
attached to the wall.One of these is on the anterior wall, anterior to
and a little above the iliac fossa; the other is above and below the
kidney on each side of the body.In these parts I have seen the
membrane forced off from its attachment to the walls, which with it
made a sac containing pus.Such an abscess, if the patient live long
enough, would doubtless cause the death of the membrane.There is in almost every case of peritonitis more or less of serous
effusion, commonly not seen at first on opening the abdomen, for it has
sunk into the pelvis.It is transparent, of a yellowish hue, and
sometimes flocculi of lymph are found in it.Whether the inflammation of the peritoneum extends to organs covered by
it is a question that has been much discussed; but it is admitted that
these organs, to a shallow depth on their surface, have an unnatural
color; and when it is remembered that the peritoneum is nourished by
vessels not exclusively its own, but running along its attached
surface, and distributed as well to the surface of the organs it
covers, it is easy to admit that to a very limited depth the organs
partake of the inflammatory disease.This supposition gives an easy
explanation of the constipation which is so prominent a feature among
the symptoms of the disease.The manner in which the false membrane is disposed of in those who
recover is an interesting question.Forty or more years ago Vogel
described the process by which the new effusion became a living tissue,
and the manner in which blood-corpuscles and blood-vessels were formed
in it; and another author had found that the time needed to complete
this vascularization was twenty days.But now Bauer and most of the
German writers inform us that the coagulated fibrin is converted into
fatty matter and is absorbed, and that when adhesions occur they result
from the coalescence of a new formation of the connective-tissue
elements built up into granules.The question, then, arises, Will the
chemical constitution of fibrin permit its conversion into oil?If it
will, then the further question presents itself, By what chemical
action is the change effected within the body?I do not intend to
discuss these questions, but propose them by way of expressing some
doubt regarding the accuracy of this statement.I have always supposed that the epithelial layer of the peritoneum was
pushed off by the first of the effusions in peritonitis, and that this
was one of the causes of the lustreless appearance of the membrane.This {1135} opinion I have never attempted to confirm or correct by the
microscope.He says: "The deposition of
fibrin occurs before the endothelium presents any changes.This
fibrinous effusion encloses, primarily, hardly any cellular elements,
and only a few cast-off endothelial cells are to be found in it.The
endothelium itself is swollen and turbid; the cell-body is increased in
size; the contents are granular; multiplication of the nuclei is
apparent; the cells are, in fact, in active division.In the tissue of
the serous membrane itself, soon after the deposition on its surface,
an accumulation of indifferent (?)cells takes place, especially around
the vessels, so that the spaces between the vessels are thus completely
filled up.The fixed connective-tissue corpuscles take part in the
inflammatory process."Delafield says: "If the autopsy is made within a few hours after death,
we find the entire peritoneum of a bright-red color from congestion of
the blood-vessels; but that is all: there is no fibrin, no serum, no
pus; epithelial cells are increased in size and number."For this kind
of peritonitis he proposes the term cellular.He finds it in cases of
local abscess of the abdominal cavity in which inflammatory action has
extended over the whole membrane, and particularly on the omentum also,
in the first two days of puerperal peritonitis."The ordinary form of
acute peritonitis is attended with changes in the endothelium and fixed
connective tissue, and with the production of serum, fibrin, and pus."He describes the migration of white corpuscles of the blood through the
walls of capillaries to become pus-cells, and then says: "Minute
examination shows that two distinct sets of changes are going on at the
same time: first, a production of fibrin, serum, and pus; second,
swelling and multiplication of the endothelial cells.If the
inflammation is very intense, the pus and fibrin are most abundant; if
milder, the changes in the endothelium are more marked."I have said above that the epithelium is early washed off by the
inflammatory effusions.In opposition--or, perhaps better, in
correction--of this idea, Delafield says: "There may be a considerable
amount of pus produced, and yet the layer of endothelium remains in
place.""If, however, the pus and fibrin are produced in large amounts,
the endothelium falls off and leaves the surface of the peritoneum
bare."The connective-tissue cells of peritoneum, he says, undergo but
little change in the first three days of the inflammation, "but by the
seventh day these cells are marked by increase in size and number in
all parts of the peritoneum."Two or three times in my life I have met with a peculiar arrangement of
the false membrane and serum of peritoneal inflammation, of which I do
not remember to have seen a description.It is this: the serum is
enclosed or encysted in bladders, the walls of which are the false
membrane.There may be two or three layers of these bladders, one upon
another, all more or less flattened, and each holding from two to six
ounces of fluid.It would seem that in these cases the inflammatory
activity rose and fell in its progress, early reaching the point at
which coagulable lymph was effused, then falling to the stage in which
serum alone escaped.This serum lifted the false membrane irregularly,
so that several pools were formed.After this the inflammation returns
to the fibrous exudation stage, and gives to these bladders a floor
which blends with the {1136} roof at the edges, and thus makes a
complete sac.Once more the inflammatory action is changed in its
intensity, so that the only effusion is serum; and this serum again
raises the new layer of false membrane into bladders--not always or
generally in the exact position of the first series.Still again, the
inflammation may be so changed as to make a fibrinous flow to this
second series of bladders.I am not certain that I have seen a third
series of these rare productions.They have doubtless been seen by
other persons, and may have been described.I have not been an
exhaustive reader on the subject, but I can well understand how they
may have been called hydatids on examination of the sacs without
looking at the contents.The fluid in the cysts is simply serum, with
no echinococcus sacs, and then the number of these inflammatory sacs
greatly exceeds the probable number of the fibrous sacs of hydatids.Pus in large quantity is not often a product of simple acute diffusive
peritonitis, although it is frequently found in that form of the
disease that attends puerperal fever, septicaemia, or erysipelas.Yet I
have seen it a few times.The pus is not generally pure, but is mixed
with serum in different proportions, and there will be seen at the same
time deposits of lymph attached to the peritoneum or scales of it
floating in the fluid effusion, or both.There is reason to believe
that in the cases of this class a very large proportion are fatal in
the acute stages, but in the cases that live for a few weeks the pus is
disposed to collect in pools and become abscesses by adhesions around
them at their borders.These abscesses are disposed to find an exit
from the body.In one case four abscesses that were found in this way
in different parts of the abdominal cavity had each burrowed toward the
umbilicus, and were actually discharging their contents at this point
when I saw the case.In another case one abscess only was formed, and
in four weeks it had perforated the colon.The opening was nearly an
inch in diameter.Kalantarians says, in eight examinations of the solar and hypogastric
plexus in persons who had died of acute peritonitis changes which he
regards as inflammatory had occurred, with subsequent opaque swelling
of the nerve-cells, ultimate fatty degeneration, brown pigmentation,
and atrophy.In chronic peritonitis the cells are often converted into
amorphous pigment matter, with increase and sclerosis of the ganglionic
connective tissue.Still, it is worthy of notice that these changes do
not express themselves in symptoms in those that recover.ETIOLOGY.--Numerous writers have expressed a doubt whether a
spontaneous acute peritonitis ever occurs, or if it is ever primary its
occurrence in this way is very rare.Habershon[1] has presented the
case with more apparent force than any other writer.He studied the
record of five hundred autopsies of peritonitis made at Guy's Hospital
during twenty-five years, but he "cannot find a single case thoroughly
detailed where the disease could be correctly regarded as existing
solely in the peritoneal serous membrane."[Footnote 1: _Medico-Chirurgical Trans._, vol.In twenty-five years
the records were probably made by a number of different persons, and
persons of varying views and varying capacity and judgment.It is
possible that the quotation may embrace some of the changes already
referred to as the consequences of peritonitis.It does embrace the
cases {1137} "when inflammation of the serous membrane occurs in the
course of albuminuria, pyaemia, puerperal fever, erysipelas, etc."It
also includes "peritonitis caused by general nutritive changes in the
system," as seen "in struma, cancer, etc.," "comprising also those
cases in which the circulation of the peritoneum has been so altered by
continued hyperaemia (modifying its state of growth) that very slight
existing causes suffice to excite mischief, as in peritonitis with
cirrhosis, disease of the heart, etc."With these explanations the statement differs widely from what it would
seem to mean without them.It is far from saying that peritonitis
always follows some abdominal lesion and is caused by that lesion.Habershon's paper was published twenty-three years ago, and during all
these years the curative treatment of peritonitis, to which the paper
itself gave currency, has enabled us to study our cases after recovery
as well as before the sickness, and it can hardly be doubted that a
much larger proportion of the cases are primary and idiopathic than
either Louis or Habershon found reason to admit.That a large number
are produced by preceding lesions and constitutional conditions no one
will be likely to doubt.Among the 500 post-mortem examinations of peritonitis reported by
Habershon, he found preceding disease or injury recognizable in the
abdominal cavity in 261.:

  From hernia, of which 19 were internal obstruction.35
  From perforation of the stomach, ileum, caecum and appendix,
    colon, etc.(other 13 mentioned with hernia, or with caecal
    disease).43
  And leading to fecal abscess (2 otherwise mentioned).17
  From typhoid ulceration without perforation .5
  From disease or operation on bladder and pelvis, viscera, etc.42
  From disease of the liver and gall-bladder.11
  From acute disease of the colon (3 others enumerated with
    perforation).3
  From disease of the caecum or appendix (9 others previously
    mentioned).3
                                                                   ---
                                                                   261

Habershon says that in the (his) second and third divisions of the
cases the causes were as follows:

  From Bright's disease .63
  From pyaemia, 13; erysipelas, 5; puerperal fever, 10; with
    pneumonia, 3.31
  From strumous disease .9
                                                                   ---
                                                                   240

I have drawn thus liberally from Habershon's paper because it is the
only paper that I know, in any language, founded on the analysis of a
large number of cases (for five hundred post-mortem examinations is a
large number for a disease no more frequent than peritonitis), in the
belief that he dealt with facts and that his conclusions must be of
great value.He may differ with other physicians regarding what
constitutes strumous disease and in the agency of heart disease.He may
have mistaken coincidence for consequence, but the paper bears the
marks of honesty and good faith from the beginning to the end.In Habershon's second division, under which he ranks the cases of
{1138} peritonitis caused by "a changed condition of the blood," he
ascribes 63 to albuminuria.Every physician knows how often meningitis
or pericarditis or pleurisy may occur under these circumstances,
especially in young persons; but, for myself, I cannot but express
surprise at these figures.In one capacity or another I have been
connected with large hospitals for forty-eight years, and have seen
many cases of albuminuria in private practice, and can recall but few
instances in which kidney disease, excepting cancer and other tumors,
has terminated in peritonitis.In modification of this statement,
however, it is proper to add that the hospital physician cannot know
how half the diseases he treats terminate, on account of the American
plan of interrupted service, and even less can he know of the mode of
death in cases which he sees in consultation.Even with this admission,
from my standpoint it is not easy to believe that one-eighth of the
cases of peritonitis are caused by albuminuria.The word pyaemia used by Habershon, it seems to me, ought to be
replaced by septicaemia, and it has been by many of the profession.Sedillot many years ago proved that laudable pus injected into the
blood-vessels of the dog produced no signs of disease, but that septic
pus, so used, was followed by grave symptoms, even death.Among the
author's cases thirteen were associated with the septic poison.He also
found five which he thinks were independent of erysipelas.One in one
hundred is a proportion hardly large enough to establish the relation
of cause and effect against the chances of concurrence.I can make a remark with reference to the inquiry by C. Dubacy in the
October number (1881) of the _American Journal of Medical Sciences_,
whether diphtheria produces peritonitis.When diphtheria became
epidemic among us in 1860 or 1861 for several years, I saw a great deal
of it, but did not recognize any relation between it and peritonitis.The relations of hernia, injuries, and operations to peritonitis need
no commentary.Perforations of the alimentary canal may require some illustrative
statements.These occur most frequently in the vermiform appendix of
the caecum, and are almost invariably caused by some irritating
substance imprisoned in its tube.In some cases it is a seed of some
fruit, as the orange or lemon; in others, a cherry-pit; in one that I
remember it was a small stone, such as is sometimes found in rice; in
others, a hard fecal concretion; in one, a child, a singular formation:
a strawberry-seed was the centre; around this a layer of fecal matter,
around the fecal matter a calcareous layer, on this, again, a fecal
layer, and so on to the number of six layers, the external one being
calcareous.This body was about one-fourth of an inch in diameter, and
may have been years in forming.In this connection I may state, per
contra, that I am informed that in a pathological museum in Boston is
preserved an appendix that contains, and did contain, a large number of
bird-shot, which did no mischief except to enlarge the appendix.This
was from the body of a man who had shot and eaten many birds.My
observation has led me to the belief that a large proportion of the
cases of peritonitis occurring in children are due to perforation of
the appendix.Of the diseases of the liver producing acute diffuse peritonitis, the
foremost, I think, is abscess, single or multiple.The different modes
in which gall-stones may produce it may be illustrated by the following
{1139} cases: (1) A lady died of acute peritonitis.At post-mortem
examination a large abscess was found, bounded above by the liver, in
other directions by adherent intestines; it contained nearly a quart of
pus: at the bottom of the sac was a single gall-stone, very large and
very black; the gall-bladder was perforated and very much shrunken.The
gall-stone had caused an ulceration of the gall-bladder, but none of
the intestines, in this respect differing from the process known as
painless transit of a gall-stone.So the calculus caused the abscess,
and the abscess caused the general peritonitis.(2) A lady between
fifty and sixty years of age had an attack of gall-stone pains; she had
had them before.In a few hours symptoms of peritonitis were manifest,
and she died.The post-mortem examination showed the ductus cysticus
was ulcerated and perforated.Two gall-stones of large size had been
formed in the gall-bladder, and had been pushed forward into the duct
about halfway to the common duct, leaving it enlarged as they advanced.The foremost one had caused an ulcer on the anterior or lower side of
the duct, and bile had escaped, staining all the right half of the
abdominal cavity, and throughout this half only the parts were covered
with false membrane and stained with bile.John Freeland of Antigua had a
patient, a <DW52> woman sixty-five years of age, who had been
suffering from intermittent fever, gastric disorder, and retching.In
one of the vomiting spells she experienced great pain, which, being
relieved by an opiate, soon returned and was attended by tympanitic and
tender abdomen.The
cavity of the abdomen was found filled with blood and bile, the
intestines inflamed and gangrenous in spots, and there was general
peritonitis.The gall-bladder was empty; the hepatic duct was
lacerated, and contained pouches in which gall-stones were encysted.This laceration was surrounded by
evidences of recent inflammation, and caused the general
peritonitis.[2]

[Footnote 2: The _Medical Record_, Dec.The perforations of the stomach which I have seen have been attended by
little inflammation of the peritoneum.Death has followed this accident
in twenty to thirty-six hours.There has been little pain, little
tumefaction of the bowels, little tenderness, but a sense of sinking
and a peculiar feeling at the stomach which the patient finds it
difficult to describe.The ulcers of dysentery do at times perforate all the coats of the
colon, and yet do not with any uniformity cause general peritonitis;
but as the destructive process approaches the outer covering the latter
becomes inflamed, and lymph enough is effused to close the opening and
prevent the escape of the contents of the intestine; so that, while
perforation is not uncommon, I have rarely seen diffuse peritonitis
accompanying dysentery.Habershon reports 5 cases in which incomplete typhoid ulcers of the
intestines caused peritonitis, and 15 from the complete perforation.I
believe that the physicians of this country and those of France have
found the complete perforation much the most common.I do not remember to have seen fecal accumulation in the intestines
produce peritonitis at all general.I did see, years ago, a man of
middle {1140} age in whom fecal impaction in the ascending colon had
caused destruction of all the layers of the abdominal wall on the right
side, so that the contents of the intestine were exposed to view in a
space of three inches by two.This implies that there had been
peritoneal inflammation enough to seal the intestine to the abdominal
wall on all the borders of this extraordinary ulcer.The man recovered
in about six months, and returned to his business.The inconsiderable operation of tapping for abdominal and ovarian
dropsy has sometimes been followed by acute peritonitis.In the early
part of my professional life I met with several such cases, and have
witnessed the same from time to time since.These were mostly cases of
dropsy from cirrhosis of the liver.Habershon found 5 such cases, and 7
in the tapping of ovarian cysts.The rupture of ovarian cysts has produced peritonitis, but in a larger
number of cases such rupture, even when the result of violence, has not
led to inflammation; but the kidney secretion has been greatly
augmented and the fluid absorbed, so that the rupture has been
beneficial rather than harmful.Tumors, particularly those of a malignant character, are apt to grow to
the surrounding structures by adhesions the result of chronic
inflammation, but now and then they provoke an acute attack which
becomes general.Benign tumors may, in rare instances, do this.In one
case a man died of acute peritonitis, and the examination showed that a
tumor noticed before death, a very large serous cyst standing out of
the left kidney, downward-forward, was the only lesion that antedated
the inflammation.Infiltration of urine, in any of the several ways in which it can reach
the peritoneum, is a cause of peritonitis.Pelvic cellulitis may also
be a cause, though twenty or thirty cases in succession may run a
favorable course with no secondary lesions; it is still recognized as
one of the occasional causes of peritonitis.Among the rare causes of diffusive peritonitis is perforation of the
intestine by lumbricoid worms.In such cases the product of the
inflammatory action is apt to be sero-purulent, with but a limited
amount of fibrin.E. Marcus reports such a perforation, and it was
called by Peris ascaridophagie.The worms were apparently not found in
the peritoneal cavity, but in the intestines.The perforation had
bloodless edges, which lay quite close upon one another, as if they had
been separated by a piercing action of the attenuated extremity of the
parasite not eaten through.[3]

[Footnote 3: _N.Y.Lusk finds that certain vaginal injections excite a local peritonitis.Sentey gives the details of a case in which a midwife undertook to
procure an abortion by the douche.She used a tube that was large with
a spreading mouth or opening, which probably received the neck of the
uterus in such a way as to prevent the return of the water.It was, in
consequence, forced into the uterus and through one of the Fallopian
tubes into the peritoneal cavity.By this a rapidly-fatal peritonitis
was developed.It would seem that
this mode of procuring abortion can be frightfully misused, however
safe it may be in skilful hands.There is a word still to be said regarding the difference between
peritonitis produced by wounds, operations, violence, and internal
growths, or {1141} what, with a little liberty, may be called traumatic
causes, and that which arises spontaneously or without recognizable
cause.The first shows a tendency to limit itself to the immediate
neighborhood of the injury, and more frequently does not become
general; while the latter spreads pretty quickly over the whole extent
of the peritoneum.SYMPTOMS.--There is, perhaps, no grave disease whose symptomatology is
more easily interpreted, in which the diagnosis is more easily made,
than the average case of acute diffuse peritonitis.Yet there are
obscure cases which it is difficult to recognize.In a well-marked case the first symptom is pain.Chomel and even some
later writers believe that chill precedes the pain, but to the best of
my recollection it has not generally so occurred to me; and the
question arises, Have they kept the symptoms of puerperal peritonitis
separated from those of simple peritonitis?The pain is first felt in a somewhat limited space in the abdomen, and
pretty rapidly spreads, so that it is soon felt in every part of the
bowels.It may remain greatest in the part where it first began, but
there are many exceptions to this statement.As the disease advances
the pain and tenderness become more marked, and the patient will try to
diminish the tension of the abdominal walls by lying on his back and by
bending the hip- and knee-joints, often also for the additional purpose
of lifting the bedclothes from his abdomen.Often the patient will
resist the physician's movement to examine his bowel with the hand.In
the last few hours of life the pain ceases.The pulse in its frequency follows the advances in the disease.At the
onset it is not much accelerated, but in two or three hours it may
reach 100 to 120 in the minute.Besides becoming more frequent, it
becomes smaller in volume and more tense.Toward the end of a fatal
case it may reach 140 to 160 in the minute and be very small.In the early hours of peritonitis the bowels begin to swell, and
percussion shows that the swelling is caused by gaseous accumulation.This increases as the disease goes on, so that in some the bowels
become greatly distended--so much, indeed, as to diminish the thoracic
space and interfere with the respiration.As the disease advances the
tympanitic resonance may give place to dulness on percussion on the
sides and lower part of the abdomen.Before the introduction of opium in the treatment of peritonitis the
green vomit was a marked feature of the disease.It occurs in other
conditions, but rarely, and its occurrence in this disease was so
common that it was regarded as almost diagnostic.The fluid vomited is
of a spinach-green color, and the color is probably derived from the
bile; at least, I have examined it repeatedly for the blood-elements,
and have not found them.In these days this symptom of peritonitis is
not often observed.Constipation is absolute in uncomplicated peritonitis of ordinary
severity, and I believe is caused by a temporary paralysis of the
muscular layer of the intestine.It has already been stated that the
blood-supply of the peritoneum is through vessels whose capillaries are
shared by that membrane and the tissues which it covers.Inflammatory
action in the peritoneum of average severity would naturally extend to
this muscular layer and render it inactive.When the inflammation
abates it recovers its contractile power.Thus, the intestines become
entirely insensitive to {1142} cathartic medicines.This fact is not
observed in puerperal peritonitis, probably because the large share
which the uterus takes of the disease may act, in some degree, as a
derivative; and then, so far as I know, the muscular layer of the
intestines does not undergo the change of color and appearance in the
latter disease that has been observed in the former.This obstinate
constipation has been noticed from the first discovery of the disease,
and during forty years in the first part of this century many
physicians believed that if they could overcome it their patients would
recover.The present interpretation of this conviction is that if
catharsis, which was very rarely effected, did precede recovery, the
disease was not of a grave type--if, indeed, it was peritonitis at all.Sometimes peritonitis occurs in the course of a diarrhoea; then the
constipation is not at once established, but the symptoms of the two
diseases concur for one or two days, when the diarrhoea ceases.Abdominal respiration ceases when peritonitis is established, either
because the movements of the diaphragm produce pain or because the
diaphragm is partly paralyzed, as is the muscle of the intestines.Then
the gaseous distension of the bowels obstructs the action of this
muscle.As a clinical fact it is important, and has often helped me in
a diagnosis.Another kindred fact is that all the indications of
peristaltic action cease.I have a great many times placed my hand on
the abdomen and patiently waited for a sensation that would be evidence
of intestinal movements, but did not discover any--have placed my ear
on the surface of the abdomen, and have long listened for the gurgling
which is so constant in healthy bowels, and have listened in vain.In
this respect my observations differ from those of Battey, who reports
that he has heard the friction of the newly-made false membrane in
respiration, while I concur with him in the statement that the
sensation of friction can be felt by pressure of the ends of the
fingers into the abdominal wall so as to produce indentation.It should
be said regarding the friction sound in respiration that Battey has the
support of Chomel, and he in his turn quotes Barth and Roger; so that
there may be in this sign more than I have thus far found.The temperature of the body is not, considering the extent of membrane
involved, remarkably high.I have recently attended a most
carefully-observed case in which the temperature never rose above 104
degrees F. It falls below the temperature of health as the disease
approaches a fatal termination.From the time this disease was recognized as a separate and distinct
affection the countenance has fixed the attention of writers.The face
is pale and bloodless and the features pinched, and the general
expression is one of anxiety and suffering.I do not remember to have
seen a flushed face in peritonitis, although the degree of paleness
differs in different patients.The mind is almost always clear, unless disturbed by the medicines used
in the treatment.Yet cases are recorded in which a mild, and still
more rarely a violent, delirium has been noticed.Subsultus tendinum,
and even convulsions, have been witnessed, but whether these symptoms
belong to the peritonitis or to an accompanying uraemia has not
received the attention of those who have witnessed them.The urine is usually scanty and high-, but it does not often
{1143} contain either albumen or casts.This statement is presumably
untrue of the cases in which Bright's disease preceded the peritonitis
and is supposed to be the cause of it--a variety of the disease with
which I have already declared my scanty acquaintance.The urine is
often voided with difficulty, and sometimes retained, so that resort to
a catheter becomes necessary.The symptoms of this disease are not invariable.In one case the
inflation of the bowels is only enough to be perceptible; in another,
as I have said, it becomes a distressing symptom, while in most the
bowels are obstinately constipated.A case may now and then occur in
which evacuations can be procured by cathartics.Pain is regarded by
all physicians as the most constant symptom, and it has existed in
every case that I have seen, or at least tenderness; but the late
Griscom stated to me that a man once came to his office for advice in
whom he suspected peritonitis; but the man asserted that he had no
pain, and the doctor placed his fist on the abdominal wall and pushed
backward till he was resisted by the spinal column, the man asserting
that the pressure did not hurt him; yet he died the next day, the
doctor declared, of peritonitis.This may be credible in view of the
fact that absence of pain in puerperal peritonitis is not very
uncommon.The green vomit, which was expected in all cases forty years
ago, for the most part, as I have intimated, disappears under the opium
treatment.There are persons in whom peritonitis does not accelerate
the pulse beyond 100 beats in the minute.The pain, in rare cases,
remits and recurs with some degree of regularity, in this respect
resembling intestinal colic.Andral reports such a case; I have also
witnessed it.MORTALITY.--Up to the time when the opium treatment was adopted,
peritonitis was a fearful word; a large proportion of those attacked by
it died of it.In 1832, I began to visit hospitals as a medical
student, and for eight years, at home or abroad, was almost a daily
attendant.The number of recoveries of those that I saw in that time
can be counted on the fingers of one hand.This may be regarded as its
natural mortality, for the treatment of that day seemed to exercise
little or no control over it.(Farther on this matter will be referred
to again.)DURATION.--Chomel believed that the disease might prove fatal in
eighteen hours, while he regards its average duration as seven or eight
days.I very much doubt whether peritonitis, not caused by perforation,
violence, or surgical operation, was ever fatal in eighteen hours.I do
not remember any case of shorter duration than two or three days.Then,
on the other hand, the period of seven or eight days in the fatal cases
appears to me too long.In the early part of my professional life I
remember to have looked for death in three or four days.At present, in
the fatal cases, life is prolonged to double or more than double that
time.In the majority of those that recover at present the duration of
the symptoms is from two days to a week; in a few they have continued
fourteen days; and lately I have assisted in the treatment of a case in
which there was little amelioration for forty days, and yet the
peritonitis was cured.DIAGNOSIS.--When the symptoms are fully developed there are few
diseases that are more easily recognized.It is when these symptoms are
slowly or irregularly manifested, or when some other disease which may
account for many of the symptoms occurs with it or precedes it, that
there {1144} should be any real difficulty.It is customary to regard
the danger of confounding the transit of a renal or hepatic calculus
with peritonitis as worthy of comment.But if the reader will turn to
the articles in this work which relate to these topics, he will find
the symptoms so widely different from those enumerated in this article
as belonging to peritonitis that he will be surprised that this item in
the diagnosis should have occupied so much room.In a case already referred to, in which peritonitis followed gall-stone
pains, the transition was so marked by the rapid acceleration of the
pulse and swelling of the abdomen that each of the three physicians in
attendance at once appreciated the significance of the change.A
physician who resided in the country called on me to report his own
case.He had a little before had a very painful affection of the
abdomen which continued for three days.The pain was paroxysmal,
confined to the region of the liver, back and front, for one day; after
that there was some tenderness over most of the abdomen, but no
tympanitis.His pulse became frequent and his temperature advanced to
103 degrees.His physicians believed that these symptoms justified them
in treating him for peritonitis.Yet his position in bed was constantly
changed, and no one attitude long continued--a restlessness which never
occurs in peritonitis, but is common in calculus transits.Add to this
the absence of gaseous distension and of the green vomit, the
paroxysmal character of the pain (though I remember one case in which
peritoneal pain increased and diminished somewhat regularly, but only
one), and, finally, the sudden cessation of the pain, such as often
happens in calculus transit when the calculus passes into the
intestine,--it is plain that his sufferings were caused by a
gall-stone.The elevation of temperature was the result of a
long-continued worry of the nervous system, and the abdominal
tenderness came from the many times repeated contraction of the
abdominal muscles which occurs in hepatic colic.And then, to make the
diagnosis more complete, this gentleman, after twelve or fourteen hours
of pain, became jaundiced--in the end very much so.There was no
absolute constipation, and the stools were of the color of clay from
the absence of bile.The points of difference between renal colic and peritonitis are even
better defined and easier recognized than those between it and hepatic
colic.In intestinal colic there may be some inflation of the bowels, and if
it continues a day or two there may be some tenderness; but it is for
the most part distinguished from peritonitis by the intermittent or
remittent character of the pain, by its greater severity while it
lasts, by its courting, rather than repulsing, pressure, by the
moderate acceleration of the pulse, by no or only slight elevation of
temperature (exception being made for long continuance), by the absence
of the green vomit, by the absence of the fixed position of
peritonitis, etc.There does not seem to me any need of spending time to distinguish
gastritis or enteritis or neuralgia from peritonitis, their symptoms
are so wholly different; and if, as is said, the mucous inflammation
can penetrate all the coats of the stomach or intestine, and so cause
inflammation of the peritoneal layer, that is peritonitis, and will be
distinguished by the proper symptoms of peritonitis.TREATMENT.--Chomel[4] says: "If general peritonitis is intense, it
{1145} should be attacked by the most powerful therapeutic agents.One
should immediately prescribe a large bleeding from the arm--from 500 to
600 grammes, for example--and repeat according to the need once or even
twice in the first twenty-four hours; apply to the abdomen, and
particularly to the part of it where the pain was first felt, leeches
in large number--fifty, even a hundred--as the violence of the disease
may demand and the strength of the patient will permit."He recommends
baths, presumably tepid, and describes an apparatus by which the
patient can be put into the bath and lifted out of it without pain;
prescribes a fixed posture, gentle laxatives, mercurial frictions,
blisters; conditionally and doubtfully, paracentesis, emetics under
certain circumstances--musk, etc.In the treatment of
general peritonitis there is no reference to opium.The word does not
occur, but it does in the treatment of peritonitis following
perforation.In this condition he would, among other things, give opium
a haute dose, but he does not prescribe any repetition or give any
details.It is probable that the idea was obtained from Graves, whose
first use of opium in this accident was in 1821, although its first
publication appears to have been by Stokes in 1832.[Footnote 4: _Dictionnaire de Medecine_, 1841.]Wardell,[5] who has written the latest treatise on the disease we are
considering, relies greatly on bloodletting, but falls short of Chomel
in the quantity of blood he would take--would bleed, not to withdraw a
certain number of ounces, but to produce certain effects.The
venesection is to be followed by the application of leeches--twenty,
thirty, or forty--to the abdomen; after this turpentine applications to
the bowels.After depletion, he says, opium should be given at once:
"two or three grains may be given in urgent cases."Vesication he calls
"another of our aids."He disapproves of cathartics, but when there is
accumulation in the colon would use injections."Opium in the asthenic
form is the chief agent, and Graves and Stokes were among the first
physicians who gave it very largely.""Two or three grains may at first
be prescribed, and a grain every four or three, or even two, hours
afterward.""In perforation there is sometimes great toleration of the
drug.Murchison has known so large a quantity as sixty grains to be
given in three days with impunity."Mercurials, he thinks, are of
doubtful efficacy.In the paragraph devoted to the treatment of
puerperal peritonitis the word opium does not occur, and it is only by
a very doubtful inference that we can assume that he would ever use it.Chomel makes no allusion to the use of opium in the same disease.[Footnote 5: _Reynolds's System of Medicine_.]For two years (1834-36) I was connected with the New York Hospital as
house-physician or in positions by which that office is reached.The
treatment of acute diffuse peritonitis then and there was formulated as
follows: First, a full bleeding from the arm, commonly sixteen ounces,
then a dozen or more leeches to the abdomen; following this, another
bleeding or not, in the discretion of the physician.Meantime, the
patient would take half a grain to a grain of calomel every two hours,
with a little opium "to prevent the calomel acting on the bowels," of
which there was no danger, in truth.Mercurial inunction was used at
the same time.The belief was that after depletion the most important
thing was "to establish mercurial action in the system;" in other
words, {1146} "to diminish the plasticity of the blood."Under this
plan I saw one recovery in these two years.In 1840, I went to Vermont to give a course of lectures in the Vermont
Medical College, and while there was called by the physicians to see
with them several cases of peritonitis.I found that they were treating
the disease on the Armstrong plan; that is, bleeding freely, and then
administering a full dose of opium, as they said, "to prolong the
effects of the bleeding."In most cases there was a second bleeding and
a second administration of opium.Leeches were also used, and
irritating applications to the abdomen, and in some cases purges.I
found they were getting better results than we were in New York, and I
studied their cases as closely as I could, and reached the conclusion
that opium was the curative agent, and that it would be safe to omit
the abstraction of blood.This conviction grew in strength with every
new case, and I saw, with different physicians, several cases, the
disease being more prevalent among the mountains there than in the
city--at least that year.The idea then formed was that to establish
the narcotic effects of opium within safe limits, and continue them by
repeated administration of the drug, would cure uncomplicated
peritonitis--that a kind of saturation of the system with opium would
be inconsistent with the progress of the inflammation, and would subdue
it.There was no theory to build the treatment on, and no explanation
of the action of the drug in my mind.What I saw of the action of two
full doses of opium was the only foundation for the idea.I had in the
course of two years after those observations in Vermont 9 cases of
general acute peritonitis, 8 of which were cured.All these were
reported in succession, as they occurred, to the medical societies and
in my college lectures.The plan was adopted by many members of these
societies and by others with whom I had opportunity of conversing on
the subject, so that soon there were several--I may say many--workers
in the field; and in all instances where the practitioner had the
courage to carry out the treatment favorable reports were returned.Not
that every case of peritonitis was cured, but the recoveries generally
exceeded those that followed any other plan ever before used.No
physician tried it with a proper understanding of its details, and with
courage to execute them, who if living does not practise it to-day.The treatment of puerperal peritonitis is not allotted to me, and I am
very reluctent to encroach in any degree on the province of the very
competent and highly-esteemed gentleman to whom that disease was
assigned.But the history of the opium treatment is very incomplete
without the statement I am about to make, and I trust to his generosity
to forgive this encroachment; and all the more confidently because he
was not at the time acquainted with the manner in which opium was first
introduced into the treatment of puerperal fever.After the curative action of the drug was demonstrated in general
peritonitis, I was anxious to try it in puerperal fever, of which
peritonitis forms a part.But I had no hospital and no obstetrical
practice.In 1847, I was appointed one of the physicians to Bellevue
Hospital, to which an obstetrical department was attached.After one or
two years a single case occurred and was sent to my division.I gave
her 100 grains of opium in four days, with more or less of calomel--I
have {1147} forgotten how much.She recovered, but after the symptoms
of puerperal fever passed away she had secondary abscesses of the
lungs.In 1840 there was a very fatal visitation of puerperal fever in this
hospital, and on invitation of Vache, who then had charge of the whole
institution, I was a daily visitor and took notes of all the cases.It
was from these notes that Vache compiled his report of the epidemic
published in the _Medical and Surgical Journal_.The disease was
fearfully fatal, although every known mode of treatment was tried in
different cases, including Brenan's plan by turpentine, but all, with
one or two exceptions, with the same result.At this time the opium
plan was on its trial, and I had not acquired a confidence in it that
authorized me to try it in these cases.One woman was sent to me in
whom the disease was well advanced.I instructed my house-physician not
how much opium to give, but what effects to produce by it.I found this
woman dying the next day, and that she had taken only three grains of
opium in three doses.In three or four days seven cases were sent me
from the lying-in wards.One was returned for error in diagnosis, and
six put under treatment.Having found that prudence in my
house-physician was so much more conspicuous than courage, another
house-officer, who combined them both, was selected to be in almost
constant attendance.The instruction I gave him was in these words: "I
want you to narcotize those women to within an inch of their lives."He
did it, and saved every one of them.This gentleman is now known over
the whole land as a learned and distinguished surgeon.I feel called
upon to give his name in this connection, that he may be a witness to
the facts I state, and for the admiration with which his nerve and
prudence impressed me.One of these patients took first two grains,
then three grains, then four, and so on till she took twelve grains of
opium at a dose, the intervals being two hours.The state into which
the patient was to be brought I have denominated a state of
semi-narcotism.The quantity of the drug necessary to produce this
state varied surprisingly in different persons.One of these women was
pretty fully narcotized by four grains every two hours.She was watched
with anxiety; restoratives were kept in readiness, but nothing was done
but to suspend the administration of the medicine and to wait.In seven
hours the consciousness was fully restored, and the improvement in her
condition was wonderful.But in a few
hours more the symptoms recurred, and the same medicine was again given
in three-grain doses, and again narcotism was produced.Taught by the
experience of the day before, we waited, and when she recovered from
this second narcotism her disease was completely cured.She took no
more medicine of any sort.This case was very instructive, as it taught
me that over certain cases of puerperal fever opium has absolute
control.From the time here referred to, so long as the obstetrical service was
maintained at Bellevue Hospital, a large proportion of cases of this
fever, as they occurred, were sent to my wards, and in all these years
I have not lost faith in opium.This statement, however, requires an
explanation.Puerperal fever is a compound disease.Its great
inflammatory lesions are found in the uterus and its appendages and in
the peritoneum.{1148} When the inflammation of the uterus is the
dominant lesion, and is purulent, opium has little or perhaps no
control over its fatality; but in the cases in which peritonitis is the
ruling lesion, if begun early, it will show its power.In this
connection I will only add that in private practice the drug has been
perhaps more curative than in the hospital.I have seen many cases in
consultation, and a decided majority have recovered.In some instances
the patient has fallen into a pleasant sleep, only broken by some
administration, and ending with her recovery.In one instance a very
eminent physician had undertaken to treat a case by the opium plan, but
he had administered the drug so timidly that for fourteen days he had
done no more than hold the disease in check.After trial, I found that
I could not induce him to give the drug in my way, and I asked him to
give me sole charge of the patient for twenty-four hours.To this he
assented, remarking, "If you cure her, doctor, I will have it announced
to the profession that she was the sickest person I ever saw get well."In half the time allowed me I was able to establish the opium symptoms
as given farther on, and the lady slowly recovered.The treatment of any form of peritonitis by opium permits the use of
the drug itself, or of any extract or preparation of it which contains
its narcotic qualities, but it is wise to persevere with that one first
chosen unless there is strong reason for a change.This caution is
based on the fact that we cannot change from one to another and be
certain to obtain the same drug activity.For example, we begin with
laudanum, and find what it will do.We cannot take in its place the
sulphate of morphia with the certainty that we can so graduate it as to
get precisely the same effects.Then the quantity which will be
effectual in one case may be quite inadequate for the next.The
tolerance of opium in different persons varies remarkably, and probably
the disease itself increases the tolerance in all.This will be
illustrated by some of the details of this paper.The drug symptoms to be produced are as follows: Subsidence or marked
diminution of the pain; some or considerable tendency to sleep;
contraction of the pupils; reduction of the breathing to twelve
respirations in the minute; in the favorable cases a considerable
reduction in the frequency of the pulse; a gentle perspiration; an
itchy state of skin, or oftener of the nose; absolute inactivity of the
bowels, and after a time a subsidence of the tumor and tenderness in
them; some suffusion of the eyes.Of these several signs of opiumism there is none more easily observed
and none more valuable than the frequency of the respiration; and while
the physician aims to reduce it to twelve in a minute, there are
chances that he will see it fall to something below that.I have often
counted it at seven, and in perhaps two cases it fell to seven in two
minutes; and yet these cases of marked oppression from opium all
recovered.In the cases in which the respiration has fallen so low
there has been considerable obtuseness of the mind; but in no case
except in the hospital patient already referred to have I seen
unconsciousness.Then the sleepiness, so long as the patient is easily
awakened, is wholly within the limits of safety.As to the quantity of opium to be given, I have known two grains every
two hours do the work, and in other cases many times this {1149}
quantity was necessary to produce this condition of semi-narcotism.The
plan is to begin with a dose that is safe--say two or three grains of
opium or its equivalent of sulphate of morphia--and in two hours notice
its effects.If any of the opium symptoms have appeared, repeat the
dose; if none, increase by one grain, and so on at intervals of two
hours till the degree of tolerance in the patient is ascertained.After
that the case can be treated by a diminished occupation of the
physician's time--two or three visits a day.The dose is to be
increased if the opium symptoms diminish before the disease yields, but
always to be diminished or discontinued if narcotism is approaching.The duration of the treatment will be sometimes no more than two or
three days; it may be a week, or even a fortnight, and in one case
already mentioned the symptoms persisted mildly for forty days, and
then yielded.In this case the medicine used was the sulphate of
morphia, and the enormous dose reached by steady and graduated increase
was one grain and a quarter every forty minutes in a boy ten years old.In some puerperal cases the doses have been so large as to require
witnesses to make the statement of them credible, and the
administration of them criminal had not the effect of each dose been
carefully studied and the amount of each measured by the action or
inadequate action of the next preceding one.Here are the doses given a woman who fell sick October 13, 1857; the
record was made by C. H. Rawson during the treatment, and was kindly
given me two or three years ago: On the first appearance of her
disease, while the diagnosis was uncertain, 10 grains of Dover's powder
gave her a quiet night.The next day the disease was more manifest, and
she took of Magendie's solution (2 grains of sulphate of morphine to a
drachm of water) x minims every hour; growing worse, at night she took
xxx minims every hour; the next day, xl minims every hour, and no
change of symptoms.She took in twenty-four hours 32 grains of sulphate
of morphia; slept, but was awakened by the slightest noise.On the
fourth day 3-1/3 drachms of the solution, and opium as follows: at 4
P.M., 3 gr.; at 5 P.M., 4 gr.; at 6 P.M., 5 gr.; at 7 P.M., 6 gr., and
6 gr.Fifth day, in twenty-six hours
took in opium and morphine the equivalent of 208 gr.of opium; on the seventh day, 221 gr.of opium; on
the eighth, 224 gr.; on the ninth, the same quantity; on the tenth, the
same; on the eleventh, 247 gr., pulse subsiding; on the twelfth, 261
gr., other symptoms better; on the thirteenth, 144 gr.hourly; slept for the first time heavily, all other symptoms
improving, bowels moved freely, ate well, tympanites subsiding;
fifteenth day, 1 gr.of opium every two hours, and at night the last
dose.The woman denied the opium habit, and the
medicines were tested by the apothecary.Such doses can only find their
justification in the demonstrated fact that smaller doses will not
produce the degree of narcotism desired.In Keating's edition of Ramsbotham's _Midwifery_ a case is reported by
myself in which a woman, by pretty rapidly increasing doses, reached
forty-eight grain doses of opium, with the effect of curing her disease
and substituting a temporary active delirium.A word of caution is probably necessary regarding the use of opium in
high doses when peritonitis and Bright's disease coexist.I have {1150}
already said that I have but scanty personal knowledge of such a
concurrence, but in Bright's disease alone I have known a large,
non-heroic dose of an opiate fatal.For example: A young man had a
felon on his finger, and did not sleep, so great was his pain.His
physician prescribed 40 drops of laudanum at bedtime.Not sleeping on
this, he took another portion of 40 drops, and in the morning he was
found in a comatose condition, and in the course of the day he died.A
post-mortem examination revealed Bright's disease, which was not before
suspected.A woman took half a grain of the sulphate of morphine--for
what reason I do not know.I was called to see her when she was in a
semi-comatose state.The time between my seeing her and that of taking
the morphine was fourteen or fifteen hours; its removal from the body
was therefore hopeless.Her limbs were swollen with oedema, and the
urine contained albumen and casts.Although the usual means of opposing
the poisonous effects of opium were resorted to, they were of little
use, and the patient died in the course of the day.These are selected
from a considerable number of similar cases that show a similarity in
their action on the brain of opium and urea.It seems that opium
precipitates the uraemic coma, yet the coma produced by these agents
combined is not so profound as that produced by opium alone.There is
in it some movement of the limbs or body or some imperfect utterances,
yet it seems to be more fatal than the coma of opium unaided.Notwithstanding all this, I have met with several cases of cardiac
disease combined with Bright's--perhaps I should say many--in which
half a grain of morphia sulphate has been taken every night to procure
sleep with only beneficial results.This has been observed several
times when physicians have been the patients.These facts are stated to show the hesitation and prudence that should
control the administration of opium when there is urea in the blood,
whether there is peritonitis or not; but a case in which one form of
Bright's disease preceded, and perhaps caused, peritonitis will be more
instructive: A gentleman sixty-eight years of age was attacked by
peritonitis on Thursday evening.There was a moderate chill at the
onset (this being one of the few cases in which I have witnessed this
occurrence).The diagnosis was then uncertain, and he took quieting
doses of Dover's powder, which gave him sleep.The next day the
diagnosis was easily made.The urine was examined for albumen, and none
found.He took only six-eighths of a grain of
sulphate of morphine in the first twenty hours.It was then increased,
so that in the next twenty-four hours he took two grains of the
sulphate in divided doses--a quantity which has been greatly exceeded
in hundreds of cases with the best results; but in this case coma was
the result.on Sunday he was comatose, but not profoundly;
he could be aroused.The breaths were five in the minute, the pulse
increasing in frequency; secretion of urine next to none.After seven hours, while the respiration was growing
more natural, the pulse grew more frequent and the stupor increased.the breathing was fifteen in the minute, and full and
perfectly easy, but the pulse was running at 140, and the coma
unbroken, and the pupils of good size.The effects of the opiate had
passed off, but those of uraemia were profound.After the alarming symptoms occurred we tried to procure another
specimen of the urine for fuller examination, but {1151} could not.It
was only after his death that we procured the evidences that he had
shown symptoms of contracted kidney for months.The urine contained no
albumen at the time of our examination, as very often happens in that
disease.Regarding other points in the opium treatment there is little to be
said.The bowels should be left
entirely at rest till they recover their muscular tone; then they will
expel first the gas, and then the feces; or if, after the inflammation
is subdued, they do not move of their own accord, injections are
admissible.I have often left the bowels absolutely inactive for
fourteen days without any recognizable consequences.If I meet a
physician who believes that leeches are essential, I yield him his
point, but never advise them.I do this because a moderate bloodletting
will do no harm, and little if any good.The same rule I apply to
irritating applications to the surface of the abdomen.Mercurials, I
think, are harmful, and therefore I object to them.As to food, it
should be milk, fresh eggs beaten up with water and pleasantly
flavored, peptones, etc.selected from among those that leave no
refuse.The testimony of physicians who have adopted this plan within my own
circle is unanimously in favor of it.B. R. Palmer of Woodstock, Vt.,
afterward of Louisville, Ky., who was the first to test it, told me
after a few years' trial that he used to dread peritonitis as he would
dread the plague, but with opium in his pocket he met it cheerfully and
hopefully, as he did a pneumonia.Chalmers of New York, who is known by
many readers of this article, has a very extensive practice, and he
told me lately that he had not had a fatal case of peritonitis in
twenty-two years.From whom did the profession
adopt it?In 1836-37, I visited daily the hospitals of London,
Edinburgh, and Paris, was in frequent intercourse with the physicians
of those cities, and never saw a patient anywhere treated by opium, and
never heard the least allusion to it.I can safely appeal to any
physician who was familiar with the history of the profession before
the year 1840, or for two or three years later perhaps, to inquire
whether anything was generally known regarding this treatment of
peritonitis, or whether he himself ever heard of it.Let the inquiry be
made of Willard Parker of New York or Alfred Stille of
Philadelphia--men of a degree of intelligence and learning that has
made them leaders in the profession--and of all the profession at that
time.I venture to assume that they were as ignorant as I was of what
Graves and Stokes had done.The following fact is significant: In 1843, Graves published _A System
of Clinical Medicine_, the preface of which is dated January, 1843.In
this he says he had previously published essays, lectures, and articles
in several medical journals.In this volume he intends, he says, "to
revise what I have written, and to compress the whole within the limits
of a single volume."There is nothing in the table of contents or
explanatory headings of the several chapters of this volume which
alludes to treating peritonitis by opium.It is fair to infer that the
cases treated in 1823 had made little impression on his mind, and that
he did not think his treatment could take rank as a discovery; and yet
Stokes had made favorable mention of it eleven years before this
publication.Graves, then, did not {1152} publish his cases, and the
first knowledge which the profession could have of them was through
Stokes's paper, published in the _Dublin Journal of Medical and
Chemical Science_, No.Perhaps the reason why Stokes's
paper produced so little impression on the profession may be found in
the fact that first numbers of journals of every sort have few readers.Anyway, it was not till after the opium treatment had attracted much
attention in this country that anybody here knew that Graves or Stokes
had ever had anything to do with it.Besides, Graves and Stokes had
only used opium in cases of perforation, and they had no plan or
symptomatic guide in the use of the drug.There is something new and strange in the following case copied from
the _Medical Record_ of May 12, 1883, under the heading, "Operative
Measures in Acute Peritonitis:" "Dr.Reibel relates the case of a
child, eight years old, suffering from acute idiopathic peritonitis.The disease had resisted all treatment, and the child being,
apparently, about to die, it was determined to open the abdomen with a
view to removing the fluid and washing out the peritoneal cavity with a
solution of carbolic acid.No fluid was
found in the abdominal cavity.In prolonging the incision a loop of the
intestine was punctured, as evidenced by the escape of gas and
intestinal fluid.The wound was washed with carbolic acid and covered
with a layer of antiseptic cotton.The following day the little patient
was nearly free from pain, and was able to retain a little milk.The
temperature had fallen from 104 degrees to 101 degrees, and the
tympanitis was almost entirely gone.The (wounded) loop of intestine
was adherent to the abdominal wall, and there had been no escape of
fluid into the peritoneal cavity.The patient made an excellent
recovery."If the statements of this abstract are true, and the future supports
the practice pursued in this case, acute peritonitis is likely to
become a surgical rather than a medical disease.Reibel thinks that
opening the intestine in the way he did is a better plan than the
punctures with the exploring-needle to relieve the patient of the
tympanitis.But it will require more facts than one to persuade the
profession that this mishap of the scalpel can grow into a rule of
practice.(The _Record_ finds this report in the _Journal de Medecine
de Paris_.)I cannot say that I see the value of a distinction made in 1877 by
Gubler between peritonitis and peritonism.By the latter term is meant
the total of nervous and other symptoms that arise in the course of
peritonitis.Trasour has lately revived this distinction, and thinks it
important, and that a light peritonitis may be attended by a grave
peritonism.He holds that the distinction is important, because "the
treatment of peritonism consists in the administration of alcohol,
chloral, and especially of opium in large doses.Of the latter fifteen
grains may be given in twenty-four hours.""The symptoms [of
peritonism] are produced through the agency of the great
sympathetic."[6]

[Footnote 6: _Med.I cannot say that I have seen great effects follow small causes, but
think that, in general, the effects of peritonitis on the pulse,
strength, nervous tone, etc.are, to some extent at least, a measure of
its severity.CONSEQUENCES OF PERITONITIS.--These are usually nothing.When recovery
takes place it is commonly complete, but cases have been known {1153}
in which the intestines have been left bound to the abdominal wall and
to each other, and so made incapable of their natural action.The
results of this are a swollen, tympanitic abdomen and impaction of the
bowels, but the general health may be very good.A woman at Bellevue
was left in this condition, yet she performed the duties of nurse in
one of the wards for some years, and finally disappeared from the
institution, and I do not know how it ended with her--probably by the
breaking up of the adhesions and a return of the bowels to their
natural condition.In some few cases there remains new tissue, which in time is partly
broken up and remains partly attached.In this manner strings and bands
of considerable strength can be formed, and into these loops the
intestine may pass, so as to form an internal hernia of a very
dangerous character.In some bands are formed across the intestine,
which by contraction flatten the tube and obstruct the fecal movement.There is reason to believe that such bands and bridles are formed by
local inflammation of such imperfect manifestation by symptoms that the
patient knows nothing about it.A very striking case illustrating the
possible sequence of this inflammation came under my observation early
in my professional life: A <DW52> woman about twenty-five years of age
gave a very clear history of a peritonitis from the consequences of
which she had suffered two years before I saw her.About six months
after recovery she began to have constipation and to suffer from small
and frequent discharges of urine.The latter gradually grew milky and
to have a bad odor; the constipation grew more and more, and at length
came to be absolute for many days; then would come a diarrhoea of some
hours' continuance, after which she would have a feeling of relief.She was emaciated, and so feeble as
hardly able to leave her bed.She vomited occasionally, and her
appetite for food was all gone.The urine was heavily loaded with pus,
and was ammoniacal.At post-mortem
examination a firm membrane was found strained across the upper strait
of the pelvis, wholly separating the abdominal cavity from the pelvic.The left posterior border was drawn very
tensely over the colon where it passed into the pelvic cavity,
flattening it down completely and making stricture.To the under or
lower surface the fundus of the uterus and the base of the bladder were
firmly adherent, and in this way both were suspended.The effect of
this unnatural suspension of the inactive uterus did not seem to be
noticeable, but with the bladder it was very different: it contained
three to four ounces of water, ammoniacal and full of pus, and it could
never have emptied itself.During the
peritonitis a false membrane was effused on the pelvic viscera in situ.When the period of contraction which is common to all such structures
came, the new membrane was separated from the greater part of these two
organs, but not from their bases.The firm attachment to the brim of
the pelvis did the rest.So unusual a sequel of peritonitis I think
deserves a record.I should add there were no adhesions above the
pelvis.Such a structure as this, found long after the active symptoms
of peritonitis have passed, as also the bands and cords before spoken
of, does not give support to the doctrine that the false membranes are
broken down into fatty matter, and in this condition absorbed.{1154} The possible remote effects of peritonitis are shown in a case
reported by E. A. Mearns to the _Medical Record_, published Sept.15,
1883: A young man, aged nineteen, four years after he had had acute
general peritonitis was attacked with constipation, which was absolute.He had had before occasional attacks of pain in the bowels and
constipation, which were overcome.He had the
train of symptoms usual in intestinal obstruction.There was no fever
or tympanitis, and this time but little pain.There was a tangle and a constriction of the intestines at the middle
of the ileum, caused by the contraction and hardening of the effusion
of the old peritonitis, and the intestine was very much softened.H. B. Sands reports in another number of the same journal: "The patient
was a man about thirty who had suffered from acute obstruction for a
week.When the abdomen was opened the
intestinal coils were found extremely adherent one to another in
consequence of a former peritonitis.A careful search failed to
discover the nature or seat of the obstruction.The abdominal wound was
closed, and the patient died soon after."There is no part of the gastro-intestinal canal that may not, from one
cause or another, become the seat of ulceration.The jejunum is the
part of the tube long supposed to be an exception to this rule, but
even in it one or two observers have found ulcers.These ulcers often
exist without distinctive symptoms, and may go on to cicatrization
without announcing themselves.In the stomach, however, there are
commonly indications which will admit a conjecture of their existence,
and perhaps a diagnosis.Sometimes these ulcers penetrate all the
tissues of the tube and allow the contents of the intestine to escape
into the peritoneal cavity, or they may have destroyed all but the
external layer, and some succussion, as in coughing, sneezing,
laughing, or perhaps straining at stool, may make the opening complete,
with the same results.In these cases it seems to be inevitable that
inflammation should follow, unless it has preceded, the complete
opening and sealed it up by adhesions.The tendency of such an
inflammation is to be local and limited, but when the contents of
intestines escape into the peritoneal cavity it usually becomes
general.These accidents are usually attended by the sudden development
of local pain, by rapid increase in the frequency of the pulse,
paleness, and prostration.The perforation of the vermiform appendix is
often a partial exception to this statement, for, while the local
symptoms are marked, the sympathy of the general system is not so
quickly awakened.The same can be said of perityphlitis.The symptoms
are often local for some time--a day or more; sometimes subside, as if
the disease were cured, and then return in full form.This is produced
by the tendency of the inflammation to limit itself to the immediate
neighborhood of its cause.Lymph is effused at a short distance from
the point of irritation, and seals the parts together, so as to shut in
the offending substance; and though this substance may produce pus in
contact with intestine or appendix, that {1155} fluid is held for a
time, as in abscess.It may be permanently held in its new-made sac
till it burrows into some near part, as the intestine or bladder, or
remain an abscess till opened by Willard Parker's puncture.On the
other hand, the contents of this sac may be increased till it breaks
bounds and causes extension of the peritoneal inflammation or general
peritonitis.In one particular case this process of setting limits and
breaking through them occurred in a young lady four times at intervals
of from one to two days.When the limiting adhesions were established
symptoms would subside, so as to encourage in her physicians the hope,
even the expectation, of recovery; but again and again the fire was
rekindled, and she died eight days after the first attack.In the
greater number of cases the first breaking of the adhesions is followed
by full peritonitis, and this often by death.The perforations of the stomach which I have seen have not been
attended by the severe pain described by most authors, but by a sudden
prostration of strength and a feeling of disquiet and sinking at the
stomach; more of collapse than of inflammation in the symptoms; no
tumefaction of the bowels; almost nothing to indicate the nature of the
accident, but a sudden new sensation in the bowels, a rapid increase in
the frequency of the pulse, it growing small as it increases in
rapidity, and a pale and shrunken countenance, and death in from twelve
to thirty hours.Then, on inspection, hardly any signs of peritonitis
are found.The peritoneal vessels are fuller and the membrane redder
than in health, and its surface covered with the thinnest possible film
of lymphy exudation, and some serum in the deeper parts of the cavity.These ulcerations of the stomach are not always fatal by peritonitis.A
few instances are recorded in which adhesions of the outer surface of
the organ to adjoining organs have taken place, so as to protect the
peritoneum almost wholly from the fatal contact with the gastric
fluids, and death has occurred in some other way.I have a remarkable
specimen illustrating this fact.It was taken from the body of a woman
of about middle age who had long had symptoms of dyspepsia, and had
from time to time vomited a little blood.It was not difficult to
recognize ulcer, but the extent and peculiarities of it could be
learned only by inspection.She died suddenly of copious haematemesis.On examination an ulcer two and a half to three inches in its several
diameters was found, beginning near the pylorus and extending toward
the left, which in this large space had destroyed all the coats of the
stomach and exposed an inch and more of the right extremity of the
pancreas and about the same extent of the liver.The liver and pancreas
were both perceptibly eroded when exposed, and in the latter an artery
that would admit the head of a large pin was opened.The stomach,
outside of this extraordinary ulcer, was strongly attached to the
adjacent organs.The ulcerations of typhoid fever penetrate the intestine about three
times in a hundred cases of the fever.This result is reached by the
study of a large number of cases, and appears to be pretty generally
admitted.The point where this perforation occurs is in the ileum, near
the ileo-caecal valve--within a foot or eighteen inches of it in the
great majority of cases, although it has been known to occur
seventy-two inches above the valve, and it has been seen very rarely in
the caecum.The fever itself may be either severe or mild.Suddenly
severe pain {1156} sets in, oftenest in the lower part of the abdomen,
and spreads rapidly; the pulse is quickly accelerated and becomes
small; and it has been lately stated that in this and other intestinal
perforations the gases of the bowels, escaping into the peritoneal
cavity, will give resonance to percussion over the lower part of the
liver.Fetid gas found in this cavity after death is not without
importance; for example, a distinguished Senator at Washington died not
long ago of a very painful abdominal disease which his physicians
declined to relieve with opium, though the patient pleaded for it.Although the distance he had to
travel was many hundred miles, he found the patient alive and still
suffering.He at once gave morphine for the relief of the pain, but the
patient died.Now, this gentleman had diabetes a year or more before
his death, recognized by his physician at home and also by myself.While under my observation the urine ceased to contain sugar and its
quantity became normal, but soon after this albumen was occasionally
found in it.The quantity was generally small, and casts were only
found now and then.This new disease was mild, and seemed to be, within
certain limits, manageable.He went to Washington under injunction that
he was not to let official and professional labors bear with any weight
upon him.This last sickness and the death would naturally enough be
supposed to be some new phase or consequence of the previous illness.But, while a post-mortem examination was not permitted, the family
wished to have the body embalmed.The family physician accompanied the
embalmer, and as the latter made a cut through the abdominal walls
there was a gush of air laden with fecal odor, and he through this
opening saw the intestines covered with false membrane.He satisfied
himself that the intestine was not opened.This fetid gas came from the
peritoneal cavity.An ulcer had perforated the intestine somewhere, and
caused the death.The final disease could be only remotely dependent on
the patient's previous illness, if at all.His impaired health may have
made the ulcer possible.All kinds of perforations in the bowels, except those of the stomach,
caecum, and appendix, even the cancerous, have one history and the same
symptoms; and if treatment is ever successful in such occurrences it
must all be based on one set of rules--absolute rest, no pressure on
the bowels, and no movements of the muscles that will aggravate it;
food that will be wholly digested and absorbed by the stomach; complete
abstinence from cathartic and laxative medicines, and the free
administration of opium or morphine.By these means, I fully believe,
numbers have already been saved from the fatal consequences of
peritonitis caused by perityphlitis and perforation of the vermiform
appendix--some under my own observation and others under that of my
friends.A boy fourteen years of age was brought to bed by a pain in
the right iliac fossa.After a few hours his father, a physician,
desired me to see him.There was already a perceptible fulness, with
dulness on percussion, in the fossa, and some febrile excitement.I
gave a portion of morphine, and promised to call the next morning.In
the morning a message came from the father stating that the boy was
better and there was no need of further attendance.The pain had returned, and had spread over most of the
bowels.He took tincture of opium, of which
I believe the largest dose was 100 {1157} drops, reached after three or
four days of gradual but steady increase of dose.From that point the
patient got better, and the quantity of the medicine was
correspondingly reduced.There were a relapse and a repetition of the
treatment, and again the disease yielded.During convalescence, about
fourteen days from the attack, the boy, after emptying his bladder, was
suddenly pressed to continue the discharge.Now he voided what appeared
to be blood, two or three tablespoonfuls.It was, however, pus with
blood enough to color it.This purulent discharge from the bladder
continued for about three weeks, the boy steadily recovering his
health.This occurred twenty or more years ago, and that boy is now a
well-known physician.In 1850, or thereabout, I attended a physician through an attack of
typhoid fever.In the third week there was a sudden outbreak of
peritonitis.The opium treatment was resorted to, and he recovered, and
had good health for twenty years after.Peritonitis occurs rarely in
typhoid fever from any other cause than perforation, and its occurrence
in this case at this time, when perforation is more likely to occur,
renders it probable, at least, that this attack was produced by that
cause.March 3, 1883, autopsy of Wm.Fletcher, age 59, iron-worker.23d, he was attacked with pain in the region of the right
iliac fossa; it was severe.There was no chill, but little fever, and
only slight acceleration of the pulse.His stomach was a good deal
disturbed, and the bowels were soon distended with flatus.I saw him on
the Tuesday following, with James D. Elliott.The bowels were a good
deal swollen and very resonant on percussion; pulse 84.His stomach was
still greatly disturbed, so that he retained no food, yet there was no
green vomit, but much flatulency.The movements in respiration were
particularly noticeable, being nearly or quite as much abdominal as in
health.There was a short friction sound in inspiration, but an entire
absence of the sound produced by peristaltic action.There was no
dulness on percussing over the iliac fossa, and no pain on pressure
over any part of the abdomen.I was careful in examining the right
fossa, for the first pain was there, and it was severe; but there was
no physical sign by which the perforation could be ascertained.Still,
my mind dwelt on the probability of perforation, and I expressed my
fears to Elliott regarding it.The bowels had not moved for two or three days.The next day Flint was added to the consultation.The symptoms had
changed but little; the pulse was 102; no pain, no tenderness, no
peristaltic action; slight friction at one point only; the abdominal
respiration was as marked as before.Frequency of respiration, 18;
patient sleepy; pupils only slightly contracted.When we were in
consultation I again expressed my fear of perforation, but Flint
expressed the most decided opinion as to its absence, because there was
dulness to percussion over the liver.I had read his paper on the
intrusion of gas between the ribs and liver in cases of intestinal
perforation, and felt as if I were almost reproved for entertaining the
thought without this physical corroboration.Thursday, March 1st, the stomach had become much more retentive; there
were no pain and no tenderness on pressure; pulse 109; no friction
sound, no sound of peristaltic action, no dulness on percussion over
right iliac fossa, but resonance over the whole abdomen, excepting over
the {1158} pubes; there the resonance was not clear; over a small space
there was dulness; this was ascribed to moderate fulness of the
bladder, and, as there had been no difficulty in emptying it, nothing
was said of it.The abdominal respiratory movements were the same as
before.Friday morning, at 3 A.M., no marked change had occurred in the
symptoms, but from this time onward there was a steady sinking of the
vital powers.The pulse grew small and frequent, the hands became cool,
the breathing more frequent, and without any sudden change or new
symptom he died early in the morning.At the last visit there was no
resonance on percussion over the liver.Autopsy, Saturday, March 3d, 2 P.M.The bowels were distended, as they
mostly are in peritonitis, but not extraordinarily.There was now
pretty free resonance over the liver.The section to open the abdominal
cavity was carefully made, with the aim of ascertaining whether there
was air or gas in the peritoneal cavity.When a half-inch opening was
made through the peritoneum, gas was forced out through it for some
seconds with an unmistakable noise.The bowels were not opened by this
cut.The bowels exposed, a very thin film of false membrane was found
on all the middle and upper portions of the intestines, with a fringe
of injection where the folds came in contact.But two or three inches
above the symphysis pubis the section opened a collection of pus which
extended downward into the pelvis.Somewhere hereabout--neither of us
could say exactly where--was found a lump of fecal matter, not
indurated, as large as a marrowfat pea, the intestine still unopened.Search was made for the vermiform appendix.At first it was not
recognized on account of its remarkable shortness.It was found,
however, pointing directly toward the median line of the body, and was
short because a part had been separated from the rest by slough.The
end of what remained was marked by a border, one-eighth of an inch
deep, of a very dark-green gangrenous color.We did not attempt to
measure the quantity of pus.It was
completely bounded and shut in by adhesions.At no time during life was there resonance over the liver, but there
was some at the time of post-mortem examination before the bowels were
opened, due perhaps to the fact that at death the relaxation of the
muscles allowed the gas to rise higher than it did during life.The
unusual median position of the abscess is important in accounting for
absence of dulness, when it is usually found in slough or ulcer of the
vermiform appendix."A Fatal Case of Typhlitis without Recognizable Symptoms."Under this
title Jose M. Fisser published a case of inflammation of the vermiform
appendix causing general peritonitis in a young woman nineteen years of
age.The peculiarities of the case were that the appendix was not
perforated, and consequently there was no tumor in the right iliac
fossa--that the symptoms were all referred to the epigastrium, without
even tenderness in the fossa.She walked the floor and tossed about in
bed; the highest temperature was 103 degrees, and the most frequent
pulse was 120, and these continued but a short time.Of tympanitis
there was none till near death, and then but little.The obscurity in
diagnosis led to the publication of the case.The cause of this disease
was fecal matter, not very hard, in the appendix.[7]

[Footnote 7: _Med.{1159} As much has been said in this article on the diagnosis of
peritonitis, it may be well to introduce a case where that diagnosis
was conjectural, and yet quite another state existed.H----, when her disease was advanced, twice.My impression was that she
had peritonitis, but this opinion was held with grave doubt.After her
death, Smith sent me the following record of the autopsy: "Mrs.H----
died Friday evening at ten o'clock; next day, at three in the
afternoon, we made an autopsy.No gas or fluid in the peritoneal
cavity; the small intestines inflated almost to bursting, with
injection of the capillaries.In the left iliac region we at once
discovered a portion of the intestine almost black, and on examination
found a firm white band encircling and constricting that portion.Upon
liberating the gas the intestines collapsed, and the constricted
portion was released and easily removed.A further examination showed
that two of the epiploic appendages, coming off from the colon above
the sigmoid flexure, had united at their extreme points and formed a
loop two and a half to three inches long, and through this loop or ring
a portion of the ileum had passed, and was there constricted.The
constricted intestine was about four feet in length.This examination
has been gratifying to me.There was a small quantity of bloody serum
in the peritoneal cavity low down in the pelvis.The dark grumous blood
that passed the bowels on the second and third days can now be
accounted for, and corroborates your remark that the hemorrhage looked
like strangulation.This must be a new
cause of strangulation, and one that we could not anticipate."There was, before I saw her, a single vomit of a suspicious fluid, but
the evidence was not strong enough to enable us to pronounce it
stercoraceous.Some of the observers noticed bloody serum in the
peritoneal cavity, and perhaps some shreds of lymph, but that was in
consequence of the strangulation.This may occur anywhere in the broad extent of the peritoneum, and will
be more or less limited in different cases, or may be limited for a
time, and then become general.The
product of the diseased action may be serum or lymph or pus, or all of
them.The cause of this local inflammation is sometimes very obvious,
in other cases wholly unknown.The consequences vary all the way from
harmlessness to death; the symptoms are as variable as the
consequences, making the diagnosis easy in some cases, in others
impossible.Some cases in which it was not difficult to recognize it
have already been recorded--those caused by perityphlitis and
perforation of the vermiform appendix, for example.In such cases the
local pain, the swelling, the dulness or resonance on percussion,
depending on whether the tumor is made by inflammatory exudation or
gas, together with the general symptoms and the history, leave but
little ground for doubt regarding the character of the disease.Perhaps
one-half the local abscesses which form between the folds of the
peritoneum are recognizable during life by the local, associated with
the general, symptoms.When situated in the posterior and upper part of
the abdominal cavity, the hand gives little, {1160} perhaps no,
assistance, as in the most widely-known case of abscess that has been
recorded in all time.While the physicians were giving to the country
hopeful reports day by day, thousands of medical men shook their heads
and spoke sadly of the prospects.The illustrious patient was losing
rather than gaining strength and flesh, his appetite poor, his
digestion poor--a strong man growing helpless--and, above all, a pulse
that for months never fell below 100.With an adequate cause of
abscess, whether there were chills or not, what else could it be?Thus,
in peritoneal abscesses that cannot be felt the general symptoms are of
great importance to the diagnosis.When abscesses tend to discharge
their contents soon or late--sometimes into the intestine, sometimes
into the bladder, sometimes externally: in such cases there is a fair
chance.Sometimes they burst into the peritoneum: such cases are almost
inevitably fatal; even opium will not cure them.The pus of these
abscesses often has the fecal odor, which it acquires by the
transmission of the intestinal gases through the intestinal walls.I
was attending, with the late James R. Wood, a young lady in whom
peritoneal abscess had been recognized.It was anterior to the
intestines.In the consultation, while we were discussing the propriety
of using the trocar, the mother became alarmed at the odor and
appearance of the urine just passed, and summoned the doctors back to
the chamber.The urine
contained pus which gave off the fecal odor strongly.It should be added that these abscesses, as well as those of
the convex surface of the liver and those that are post-peritoneal,
sometimes pierce the diaphragm and produce empyema, or by previous
adhesion of the lung to its upper surface find a way into a bronchial
tube, and so the pus is expectorated.The history of local fibrinous exudations is not as easily told as that
of the purulent.We find from time to time, on the peritoneum, bands,
patches, or cords of false membrane, which were produced in so quiet a
way that we can get no information regarding the time when they were
formed, and perhaps the subject of them was not aware that anything was
wrong with the bowels till he began to have the symptoms of
obstruction.The omentum is found thickened and contracted.The mesentery and
mesocolon are seen in a similar condition, causing wrinkling and
shortening of the bowels.The spleen has on its surface patches or even
plates, or one great plate, of firm fibrinous deposit, often
cartilaginous in density, sometimes calcareous; and we can rarely fix
the time of these occurrences by any symptoms.It is not always so with
the liver.We are acquainted with a perihepatitis which is acute,
attended by pain in the right side, a febrile movement, and, if the
inflammation reaches the under surface of the organ, by jaundice, and
have learned to combat this with cups and opiates, the latter in rather
free but not heroic doses, and to expect recovery in a few days.This
may leave the liver wholly or partly invested with a layer of false
membrane which may have a sequel of importance.Then, again, we find
the organ invested with a thick contractile membrane, but cannot learn
that the symptoms of perihepatitis have ever occurred.The diseased
action which produced this bad investment appears to be analogous to
that which not only covers the organ with a thinner coat of similar new
tissue, but inlays it everywhere with the same material in cirrhosis.This also is {1161} unattended by local pain.The effects that may
result from this encasing of the liver in a strong contractile capsule
may be illustrated by the following case (the late Buck was the
physician): The patient was an unmarried lady of middle age who had
consecrated her life to charitable works.In searching for the
suffering poor she often had to ascend several flights of stairs.The
time came when she found this fatiguing and a tax on her respiration.She observed at the same time that the bowels were enlarged.She called
Buck, and he had no difficulty in discovering ascitic fluid.He was
surprised, as he knew that her habits were perfectly good, and she had
very little the appearance of an invalid.Notwithstanding the proper
use of the usual remedies for dropsy, the fluid slowly increased, and
at length he was obliged to draw it off.He found it to be a clear,
yellowish serum.In the course of about two years she was tapped four
times.I saw her, with Buck, after these tappings, when the fluid had
again been effused in quantity that half filled the peritoneal cavity.The emaciation was not considerable; there was nothing of the
semi-bronzed color of the skin so common in cirrhosis of similar
duration; her appetite and digestion were not materially impaired; the
temperature was natural; the pulse was increased in frequency only a
few beats.The skin over the abdomen was in a soft, natural state, and
there was nothing that suggested a hyperaemic or inflammatory dropsy.The liver on percussion appeared to be reduced in size.Taking all
things into account, and especially the patient's habits and the
absence cancerous cachexia, it seemed probable that the dropsy arose
from atrophy of the liver, and that the atrophy was caused by an
adventitious capsule of the organ, although the patient had never had
symptoms of perihepatitis.From this point the fluid did not increase
or diminish, but remained stationary till she died, perhaps two years
after, of some other disease.Meanwhile, the lady resumed her favorite
charity-work to a limited extent.At the post-mortem examination the
capsule was found investing nearly the whole liver, but not materially
obstructing the gall-duct.The new membrane was thick and strong,
having a thickness of at least one-twentieth of an inch.The remaining
liver structure was of natural appearance.The organ was reduced to
one-half its natural size.I have doubted whether any disease deserving this name really exists
independent of such low inflammatory action as may arise from the
irritations of tumors or heterologous deposits.This statement refers
to general not local peritonitis.I have never seen anything that would
lead me to believe that acute diffuse peritonitis can be deprived of
its acute character and still continue an inflammation.With me it has
always been death or cure.I have already referred to a case in which
after recovery the bowels were greatly disturbed by tympanitis for
years.But this came from adhesions: her general health was good.I
have at long intervals met with cases of ascites in which the
peritoneal membrane was redder than natural, and in which no
obstruction to the portal {1162} circulation was discovered.This,
however, I have regarded as hyperaemia rather than inflammation.Bauer,[8] however, gives to these cases the title latent general
peritonitis, especially when after death an abnormal adhesion is found
here and there.In the cases that I have seen there was a peculiar
state of the surface of the abdomen.The skin there was more or less
scaly and dry, but I do not remember whether there were internal
adhesions.Bauer regards the diagnosis of this form of disease as
difficult, but refers to the constantly present meteorism as well as
serous fluid.I have met with three or four instances in which at the
time of puberty an abdominal dropsy has rather suddenly occurred,
lasting one to three months, and disappearing on the use of diuretics.I have had no reason to attribute this effusion to inflammatory action,
except in one case.A lady of extraordinary symmetry and beauty of
form, in excellent health, whom I had treated for this disorder twelve
years before, applied to know whether there was anything in that
disease that would prevent her having children.She had been married
seven or eight years, and had not been pregnant.The question then
occurred to me, At the time of the dropsy could there have been lymphy
exudation that has since confined the ovaries in an unnatural position?The treatment which Bauer prefers for
his latent peritonitis consists in "painting with iodine, the use of
diuretics, and the regulation of diaphoresis by means of Turkish
baths."[Footnote 8: _Cyclopaedia of the Practice, etc._, vol.Another form of general chronic peritonitis is, according to Bauer,
that which follows acute peritonitis.He quotes several authorities in
support of his views.I must draw on him for a description of it, for,
as I have said, practically I know nothing about it.The symptoms of acute peritonitis are all toned down, but do not all
disappear.Vomiting occurs occasionally; tenderness is diminished, but
is quite perceptible; meteorism diminishes, but fluctuates greatly;
appetite is poor or variable; constipation alternates with diarrhoea or
is followed by dysentery; now there is a febrile heat, and then the
temperature is normal--this fever is most likely to come in the
evening; the pulse is frequent and varying; ultimately extreme
emaciation and anaemia.The most striking feature of this condition
appears to be sacculation of the fluid in the abdomen, wholly or
partially; this fluid then is not freely movable, but will give dulness
on percussion, which may contrast well with intestinal resonance in its
immediate neighborhood.When the tension of the abdominal wall is
diminished these sacs can be felt by the hand as uneven tumors.Colicky
pains occur, and in a case cited it was at one time very severe, at
another only slight.The majority of the cases terminate, after a
protracted course, fatally.Recovery may occur by absorption or
external evacuation of the fluid.Bauer makes still another class of cases of chronic peritonitis--those
arising in the course of old ascites; he, however, does not make much
out of it.He thinks the cases of this kind occur with cardiac and
hepatic disease, and particularly with the nutmeg liver.The symptoms,
he admits, are neither well defined nor severe, and the anatomical
changes consist "in thickening of the serous membrane by a slight
deposit of fibrin, {1163} slight turbidity of the ascitic fluid, and a
few flakes of fibrin suspended in it."He then, strangely, gives, as if
they were illustrations of such a disease, two cases in which death by
acute peritonitis followed the last of many tappings, in one of which a
pool of pus was found encysted in front of the intestines.Probably most practitioners who are in the habit of making post-mortem
examinations have seen the flakes of lymph in the ascitic fluid, etc.,
but the German physicians have been the first, I believe, to regard
such cases as belonging to separate forms of disease.William Pepper has published[9] a case observed by himself and G. A.
Rex which shows non-malignant chronic peritonitis better than any I can
recall to mind.The report forms the sequel to the case of the young
woman on whom he successfully performed paracentesis of the
pericardium.This young woman began to have double pleuritic effusion, and this was
soon followed by ascites three and a half months after the operation.From that time the ascites was better or worse, but did not wholly
leave her, and became considerable before her death.This was sudden,
she having some convulsive movements in extremis.Lesions were found in
the thoracic cavity like those discovered in the abdominal, showing, it
was believed, a special tendency in this person to plastic exudation on
the serous membranes."The lower part of the abdomen was found occupied
by an extensive effusion.There
were few if any signs of inflammation of the intestinal peritoneum, but
marked changes were observed in the parietal peritoneum and in the
capsules of the liver and spleen.The peritonitis was most marked in
the upper segment of the abdomen, while the parietal membrane presented
large patches of irregular thickening.No tubercles were found on any
part of the peritoneum.The capsules of the liver and spleen were
greatly thickened, whitish, opaque, and densely fibrous.The liver was
enlarged and heavy, and so tightly bound by its thickened capsule that
its shape was somewhat altered."The diaphragm, especially that part of it underlying the pericardial
sacs, had undergone marked fibroid degeneration.The muscular tissue
was much atrophied; many fasciculi had evidently disappeared, while
many others were markedly narrowed, some of them shading off to a width
of less than 1/3000 of an inch, and finally disappearing altogether.They retained, however, even in their narrowest dimensions, their
transverse striae."(It may be remarked, in passing, that this substitution of fibrous for
muscular tissue follows the same law that it does in the heart when
that organ is the seat of fibrosis or fibrous degeneration.Here it was
supposed to be the consequence of a low grade of inflammatory action.In the abdomen these observers found nothing which suggested the
possibility of tubercles or any obscure form of cancer.In the
pericardium, on the heart side, were found numerous small nodular
roughnesses.Irregularities of the pericardial false membrane are so
common that nothing but the close and universal adhesions would raise
any question of these relations.But tubercles would hardly be here and
nowhere else.{1164} Delafield says that one form of the chronic disease is the
continuance of his cellular peritonitis.In this, he says, the surface
of the omentum is covered with cells which look as if they were derived
from the endothelium and connective-tissue cells, although they differ
from the normal shape of these.The new cells are for the most part
polygonal, of different size, with one or several nuclei, and
giant-cells--large granular masses filled with nuclei.Although these
new cells are produced over the entire surface of the peritoneum, yet,
as a rule, they are more numerous in little patches here and there.These little patches may be heaped together in such numbers as to form
nodules visible to the naked eye.There is never any stroma between
these cells.This form of peritonitis occurs most frequently with organic heart
disease, with cirrhosis of the liver, with chronic pulmonary phthisis,
and with acute general tuberculosis.In the two latter diseases he
thinks they have been improperly called tubercles.He describes a form of chronic adhesion of peritoneal surfaces that
occurs without the intervention of fibrin, but, as he supposes, by
coalescence of the branching cells and a production from them of a
fibrillated basement substance, the fibrils crossing in all directions.In the midst of these fibrils he finds the nuclei of these cells.He
finds also in the immediate neighborhood of these adhesions thousands
of branching cells that are attached one to another and float free in
the water, the fixed end being attached to the peritoneum.He regards
such a peritonitis with adhesions as a more advanced stage of the forms
of cellular peritonitis already described, and the new cells are
changed into membrane.Sayre has published an extraordinary case in the _Transactions of the
Pathological Society_.He calls it chronic proliferative peritonitis;
it might be called more aptly the consequence of peritonitis.A large, strong man fell from a hammock, the rope breaking, upon his
shoulders, and felt a severe pain in his stomach, and soon developed
symptoms of peritonitis.About one month after he was tapped, and
240 ounces of serum were drawn.He was tapped one hundred and
eighty-seven times, and 1203-5/16 pounds of fluid were taken from him
during the remainder of his life.The liver and spleen were covered by a
thick layer of false membrane, intestines were glued together in the
upper part of the abdomen, and the stomach was adherent to the lower
surface of the liver.The portal vein was contracted by this membranous
coating.There were numerous other lesions in the heart and pleura, but
these will account for the dropsy.This man was unusually strong and hearty until 1876, when he had an
attack of double pleuro-pneumonia, and in 1878 he slipped on the front
steps and fell, but seemed to recover from the effects of this.The
fall from the swing occurred in July, 1879.[10]

[Footnote 10: _Med.{1165} Tubercular Peritonitis.This form of disease is by no means uniform in its first symptoms or in
its progress.The only things uniformly attending it are tubercles on
the peritoneum and more or less of inflammatory effusion, chiefly lymph
and serum; tumor and hardness of the bowels, general or local; deranged
function of the stomach and intestines; emaciation; and extreme
fatality.In some cases the invasion is acute and marked--a chill followed by
fever, vomiting, early development of meteorism, and in a few days a
point or points of resistance to pressure, but not necessarily dulness
on percussion.In a few days the febrile action and the meteorism may
subside, leaving the symptoms of local peritonitis.But we have not
long to wait for a renewal of them and an evident extension of the
inflammatory action.Remission and relapse alternate at varying
intervals, until the whole extent of the peritoneal surface seems to be
involved in inflammation.With this mode of development meteorism may
not be renewed in the most common way.The lymphy product of
inflammation may so bind the intestines to the posterior walls of the
abdomen that they cannot extend forward, but are pushed upward against
the liver and diaphragm, and so encroach on the thoracic space.But
then the anterior parietes are tense and hard, and do not move in
respiration.The febrile heat may not continue more than two or three
months, but the pulse will be frequent to the end.There will be a
thinning of bowel walls, and here and there a knuckle of adherent
intestines may cause some prominence and give some resonance on
percussion.There will be also occasional vomiting, and the dejections
will be irregular--maybe only deficient or thin; there may be an
alternation of constipation and diarrhoea.Tuberculous ulcerations of the mucous layer of the bowels is not
uncommon in tubercular peritonitis, and these ulcers have in rare cases
perforated and allowed the fecal matter to accumulate in considerable
quantity in a sac limited by previous adhesions.In all forms of
tubercular peritonitis death is caused as often by grave complications
as by what appears to be the primary disease.The affection occurs in
probably every instance in those who had at the beginning, or had
acquired in its progress, what we call the tubercular diathesis.We are
not surprised, therefore, to find on inspection a wide diffusion of
tubercles in the body, particularly on other serous membranes, and in
the lungs.Death may occur, then, from phthisis pulmonalis or from
pleurisy or meningitis, as well as from the exhaustion and accidents of
the peritoneal disease.The effusion serum or turbid serum is very
common in tubercular peritonitis, and can be recognized by the dulness
it produces in part of the cavity, and sometimes by fluctuation.It is
often sacculated, but it is not constantly found after death, it having
been absorbed before, and perhaps long before, that event.In other cases the invasion of the disease is stealthy and deceiving.It comes so quietly that the patient is not conscious of any local
disorder beyond a dyspepsia and irregular action of the bowels.He has
a pulse of growing frequency, but if he knows it he ascribes it to his
dyspepsia.He is slowly losing flesh and strength; this he accounts for
in the same way.At length a perceptible swelling of the bowels
attracts his attention.At this stage the physician finds that the
swollen bowels are tympanitic everywhere or only in the upper, while
there is evidence of fluid {1166} effusion in the more depending,
parts.He discovers some, it may be little, tenderness on pressure, and
a pulse of 85, or maybe 90, increasing in frequency toward evening.The
appetite is poor, the digestion slow, and occasionally there is
vomiting; the complexion is pale and a little dingy; the skin of the
abdomen may be dry and rough or may be natural; some colicky pains have
been or soon will be felt.From this point the disease gradually
advances.The distension of the bowels slowly increases or they are
firmly retracted; the emaciation increases; the strength diminishes;
there is often cough, which is generally dry; the bowels are slow or
diarrhoea alternates with constipation; with the distended bowels there
is always more than natural resonance on percussion, except when there
is fluid effusion, though not often the full tympanitic sound observed
in acute diffuse peritonitis.This resonance is not equal, always, in
different parts of the abdomen; the respiration is embarrassed and
almost wholly thoracic.The abdomen is often as large as that of a
female at full term of pregnancy, and indeed the condition has been
mistaken for pregnancy.This is an inexcusable blunder in a case like
that which I have in mind--a young unmarried woman.She had no dulness
on percussion in the space that would be occupied by the gravid uterus,
but rather resonance.The case might have been a little less clear if
there had been fluid effusion in the abdominal cavity, but if this were
not encysted it would flow from one side of the abdomen to the other
when the patient turned correspondingly in bed; if it was encysted,
there would be small chances that it would have the shape and position
of the gravid uterus; if it had, there would be no chance of hearing in
it the foetal heart or feeling the foetal movements; and after all this
there remains the experimentum crucis--a vaginal examination.Some aid is found,
possibly, in the medical history of the family, in tuberculous
antecedents, yet I remember cases in which no phthisis could be found
in any living or dead member of the family on the paternal or maternal
side as far back as it could be traced.Some aid is found if the
patient himself has any of the physical or rational indications of
pulmonary phthisis, and yet there are recorded cases in which the
abdominal symptoms were the first to appear.The prominent German
physicians attach great importance to the pre-existence of a cheesy
mass or degeneration somewhere in the body as the real parent of
tubercles wherever they appear.The truth of this doctrine, I do not
think, has received anything like universal recognition; and if it had,
as this cheesy degeneration is often, perhaps commonly, only
discoverable after death, it could rarely give any assistance in
diagnosis, so that the early diagnosis is always difficult, and a very
early one often impossible.But as time goes on, and the symptoms are
better defined and show themselves one after another as they are above
described, it seems as if a careful observer could not confound it with
anything except perhaps one of the other forms of chronic peritonitis
or cancerous peritonitis.As to the latter, the cough which exists in
most cases of tubercular peritonitis will assist in the distinction,
but a physical examination much more; for a cough does not always
attend phthisis when this disease exists; for example, I visited a
daughter of one of the distinguished gentlemen of Vermont.She had had
the bowel symptoms that indicated tubercular peritonitis for eight or
ten months, and the diagnosis was not {1167} difficult.Remembering
Louis's opinion that if tubercles invade any other part of the body,
they are likely to be found at the same time in the lungs and in a more
advanced condition, I examined the lungs, and found in the upper part
of the right a cavity so large that it could have received a fist.I
was only surprised by the fact that she did not cough, and had not
coughed.She herself assured me of that (she was twenty-one years old);
her physician, who was present at the visit, had never heard her cough,
and had no suspicion of any pulmonary complication; but, more than all,
her mother, who had walked with her, slept with her, eaten with her,
travelled with her, and from the beginning of the illness had not been
out of her company more than twenty minutes in any twenty-four hours
since the disease began, had never heard her cough.Here, then, the
nervous deviation to the abdomen, or whatever else it may have been,
had so benumbed the sensibility of the pulmonary nerves that the
alarm-bell of phthisis had never been sounded; but the cavity, had
there been any doubt whether the bowel disease was cancerous or
tuberculous, would have almost fully settled the question.But more of
the peculiarities of cancerous peritonitis a little farther on.The lesions of this disease (or its pathological anatomy) differ
considerably, but the differences are in the amount of tuberculous
deposit and the secondary results, not in the real nature of the
disease.Lebert has published among his plates of pathological anatomy
one which shows the peritoneum thickly sprinkled over with small
tuberculous grains, and represents each particular grain surrounded by
a little zone of inflammatory injection.There is yet no exudation, but
that would soon follow.A fibrinous exudation will soon come over this
primary deposit, and undergo a kind of organization, or at least get
blood-vessels, which in their turn can furnish the material for a new
crop of tubercles.These again provoke a new layer of fibrous tissue,
which also becomes studded with tubercles, and so on, till a thick
covering is formed over the intestines.But the same material is
interposed between their folds, separating one from another and
compressing them and diminishing their calibre; at the same time this
agglomerated mass is firmly adherent to the abdominal walls everywhere.The new material may have a thickness of half an inch or even more.I
remember how surprised and confused I was when I made my first
inspection of such a case.The abdominal walls were cut through, but
they could not be lifted from the intestines, but were firmly adherent
to something.They were carefully dissected off and the bowel cavity
(?)exposed; there was apparently an immense tumor filling the whole
space: no intestines, no viscera, could be seen.A section was made
through this mass from above downward, and another parallel with it and
an inch distant from it, and this part removed.It appeared like a
large, hard tumor, through which the intestine made several
perforations.The new material appeared to be fibrous, with
grayish-white tubercles sprinkled in through it everywhere, and pretty
abundantly.In another case this fibro-tubercular material may occupy
one part of the abdomen, and a large serous cyst or serous cysts
another.The tuberculo-fibrous material may be found in markedly less
quantity than is so far described, till there will be no more than in a
case from Ziemssen's clinique, quoted by Bauer: "In the peritoneal
cavity about four liters of yellowish-brown, slightly turbid fluid.Omentum {1168} thickened, stretched, adherent to the anterior wall of
the abdomen and beset with hemorrhages; the same was true of the
parietal peritoneum; between the hemorrhages whitish-yellow and
entirely white tubercles occur, varying in size from the head of a pin
to a lentil.The
intestines intensely inflated; a number of ulcers on the mucous
membrane, one approaching perforation.Covering of the liver thickened
by fibrinous deposition."The lungs and serous membranes generally will, in all probability, show
more or less of tubercular deposit, the pericardium less frequently
than the others.The result in this affection, after it is fully established, is
believed to be uniformly fatal, and at its commencement the difficulty
of diagnosis may lead one to doubt whether his apparent success is
anything better than apparent.Still, a plan which I have relied on is,
I believe, worth announcing.As soon as the disease is recognized the
patient is put upon the use of the iodide of potassium and the iodide
of iron, in full average doses, and a solution of iodine in olive oil
is applied to the whole surface of the abdomen by such gentle friction
as will produce no pain; and after a minute or two of such friction the
oil is brushed thinly over the surface and the whole covered with oiled
silk.The quantity of iodine to
an ounce of oil will vary considerably in different persons; for some,
seven to ten grains will be enough; for others, thirty will be needed.The iron is to make the application moderately irritating, and if it
produce pinhead blisters or blisters a little larger, all the better.When the application becomes painful the oil is washed off, and the
application is not renewed for two or three days.In this manner it may
be continued for two or three months.Meantime, the patient is put upon
the diet and regimen of the consumptive, the appetite encouraged; he
takes sustaining food, with plenty of milk and cream, or cod-liver oil,
as much fresh air as possible, and friction is applied to other parts
of the body with dry flannel.Benign tumors of the abdomen are not frequently the cause of general
peritonitis, and when they are, the grade of the disease is acute
rather than chronic.They very often provoke local inflammation and
become adherent to the neighboring structures.The same is true of
malignant growths in the abdominal cavity, except that the adhesions
are earlier formed and more likely to occur.Localized cancer, of
whatever variety, is not very prone to produce general peritonitis,
even though there be multiple developments of it.But when the disease
takes the disseminated form, and is sprinkled over the whole extent of
the peritoneum, then inflammation is almost certain to occur--not of
high grade, and yet deserving the name subacute rather than chronic.A
case which illustrates this statement has come under my observation
within the last year.I will recite it with sufficient detail to make
it intelligible.A lady about forty years of age had, up to the summer of 1881, enjoyed
very good health, though she was never robust.At that time she felt
her strength abating and her stomach disordered.She sought {1169}
health in various places, and took professional advice in September.It
availed her little; the bowels were gradually swelling and fluctuation
could be felt.There was not a
cachectic countenance, but the features were growing sharp.She had
suffered but little from pain till October.At that time she was at the
family country home.Then she began to suffer from a severe pain in the
left thigh; and this, it was noticed, increased as the accumulation in
the bowels increased, and at length her physician felt compelled to tap
her--not so much on account of great distension of the bowel as in the
hope of relieving the pain.He drew off nine quarts of gluey, viscid
fluid, and her pain was wholly relieved.Twelve or fifteen days after
this she was brought to her city home, and her city physician, seeing
that her case was a grave one, sought the aid of a distinguished
gynaecologist.She was then again tapped to give him a more
satisfactory examination.He found the ovaries considerably enlarged
and hard.They could not, however, be felt by pressing the fingers into
the pelvis from above--only by the vagina.I saw her on the 10th of
November.The fluid had again made considerable tumefaction of the
bowels, and she was again suffering great pain in the region of the
right kidney and in the leg of the same side, together with cramps.The
relief given by the first tapping induced us to propose its repetition.It was, however, delayed till the 14th, that the physician who had
tapped her before might be present and assist.The quantity of water
drawn was again nine quarts, and again the pains and spasms were
quieted.It was
nearly clear, reddish, of syrupy flow and consistence, and so viscid
that while a portion of it had remained on the slide of the microscope
long enough for the examination of its constituents the thin cover
became so firmly attached to the slide that it could not be removed
without breaking or long maceration.The albumen was so abundant that
the fluid was completely consolidated on boiling.Fibrinous threads
were running through it in great numbers, and here and there was a cell
of large size, round, granular, but not plumped up with granules, with
a nucleus barely less in size than the cell itself; its outer border
within, but only just within, the boundary or wall of the cell.It was
the nucleus that was granular, for there was little room for granules
between the nucleus and the cell wall.The vial containing the fluid
had been standing three or four hours for a sediment.This in a vial
four inches high occupied the lower half, and gave nothing to the
dropping-tube till the sedimentary matter was drawn into it by suction.This matter consisted of fibrillated fibrin in large quantity; a great
number of the cells just described, some grouped, but most separate or
single.There were pus-cells in moderate quantity, each having the
amoeboid movements, and a considerable number of red blood-corpuscles,
some of natural form, some crenate.Immediately after the tapping the flaccid condition of the abdominal
walls admitted an examination.A solid, hard mass was found running
across the upper part of the bowels, a nodule of which was lying on the
stomach at the point of the ensiform cartilage.A harder mass of
irregular shape was also found just above the pelvis on the right side,
extending upward and to the right.This was in extent two by three
inches.The ovary, however, could not be detected by pressure from
above {1170} downward.The diagnosis up to this time was hardly
doubtful, but these revelations made it complete, and crushed any
lingering hope of the patient's recovery.While the pain and spasm ceased after the tapping, the oedema of the
left leg, which came on some time before the last tapping, did not
diminish.The hard spot near the right iliac fossa was tender on
pressure, but otherwise hardly painful.While the fluid did not exceed
six quarts or so, she had little pain anywhere.There were no external
glandular swellings.Her appetite was poor, and she took but little
food.She vomited very little till the end was approaching.The urine
contained a few globules of pus, some pigment matter, two or three
hyaline casts, but no trace of albumen.For sixteen days following
November 14th the patient was comfortable, but the fluid was slowly
filling the bowels again.At that time the pains already referred to
began to return.On December 5th they required another tapping, and
preparations were made for it, but vomiting, rather severe, led to its
postponement to the next day.The quantity of fluid drawn was nine and
a half quarts.It was of the same syrupy consistence as that previously
drawn, and under the microscope showed exactly the same constituents
and gave the same quantity of albumen.The next day stercoraceous
vomiting commenced, with no movement of the bowels, except what was
produced by 10 grains of calomel given on the second day of this
vomiting.She after
this took no food by the mouth, but milk and beef-tea were injected
into the rectum.Still, the fecal vomiting returned, and she died on
the 15th.The post-mortem examination was made on the 17th by William H. Welch.His report is complete as to the main features of
the case, though it does not furnish an explanation of the spasms and
the oedema of the left leg, regarding which Welch was not informed.The
pain and spasm were doubtless due to backward pressure of a diseased
part on a nerve or nerves, and the oedema to a narrowing of the iliac
vein by pressure or constriction by fibro-cancerous matter on its outer
sides."The peritoneal cavity," he says, "contained somewhat over a
gallon of clear, yellow serum.Both the visceral and parietal layers of
the peritoneum were thickened, in some places more than in others; this
was especially marked on the anterior of the stomach and on the lower
part of the ileum and in the left iliac region.The omentum was greatly
thickened and retracted into a firm mass (or roll), which extended
somewhat obliquely across the body, more to the left than to the right.The mesentery was much thickened and contracted, drawing the intestines
backward.In a few places only was the peritoneal surface coated with
fibrin, and the intestines were mostly free from adhesions.The coils
of the lower part of the ileum, however, were firmly matted together by
organized connective tissue in such a way that they were twisted, often
at a sharp angle, so as greatly to constrict the calibre of the gut.The serous and muscular layers of the intestine at this point were
greatly thickened.By these causes there appeared to be a complete
obstruction at a point about six inches above the ileo-caecal valve.By
careful dissection these coils were straightened out, so as to remove
the main cause of obstruction.The peritoneal covering of the liver was
adherent to the parietal layer.{1171} "The surface of both the visceral and parietal peritoneum was
studded over with hundreds of small, firm, whitish nodules, generally
not larger than a pea, and often not larger than a pin's head.In some
places they had coalesced and made firm patches an inch in extent.This
same material was found in the contracted omentum in considerable
quantity.In a few places, particularly on the uterus, a blackish
pigmented deposit appeared."The ovaries were not adherent, but both were enlarged to the size of a
hen's egg.The outer surface of each was rough and corrugated.The new
growth was deposited on the exterior and penetrated each a quarter to
half an inch.It was of uniform white color and of firm consistence."The stomach wall was thickened nearly throughout its extent, but
particularly in the anterior part, where it amounted to thrice the
normal thickness.This consisted wholly of hypertrophy of the muscular
coat and increase of fibrous tissue in the peritoneal layer.This new
growth was traced, in the interlacing bands, from the surface into the
muscular coat.In the outer layer of the stomach were found three small
white nodules.The mucous membrane of the organ was healthy or a little
pale."The retro-peritoneal glands along the aorta were enlarged, soft, and
of a reddish-gray color.A nodule was found in the wall of the duodenum
outside the mucous membrane, and one in the Fallopian tube."Every organ in the abdomen and chest was examined, but nothing
important found except what is here recorded.Welch concludes his
record with the following diagnosis: "Primary scirrhous carcinoma of
the ovaries.Secondary deposits in the peritoneum, in the outer layer
of the right Fallopian tube, of the stomach and duodenum, and in the
retro-peritoneal glands.This case presents to the reader so accurately the usual course of
cancerous peritonitis, and the inspection its lesions, that a treatise
on the subject is hardly called for.It often happens that cancerous
antecedents in the patient or his relatives will lend an aid to the
diagnosis, which this case did not present.To distinguish this disease
from tubercular peritonitis no question can arise except in its
dropsical form, and then the lungs in every case of the latter that I
have met with have the physical signs of tubercles, though not always
the rational indications.The pulse is much more accelerated in the
tuberculous variety.I omitted to state that the temperature of this
patient was often taken, and till the closing scene was never found
more than one or two degrees above the healthy standard, and the
morning and evening heat did not materially vary; the opposite of both,
then, would be expected in a tuberculous case.The existence of
meteorism is much more common in the tubercular disease; indeed, in the
cancerous case recited there was none of it.The duration of the two is
different--that of the cancerous kind is recorded in months, while the
tuberculous variety may continue two years.The cancerous is more
likely to be attended by alarming accidents, like the complete
obstruction of the bowels, large hemorrhages, and a sudden lighting up
of acute peritonitis.Finally, in the light of the case here recorded,
it seems probable that the examination of the abdominal fluid will
become of great importance.I have never carefully examined the fluid
of tubercular dropsy, but it does not seem probable that it will have
the syrupy {1172} appearance, the large amount of albumen, the
abundance of fibrin-fibres, and the granular large cells with nuclei
only perceptibly less in size than the cells themselves, that were
repeatedly found in this case--found by two observers, and at every
tapping after the first.TREATMENT cannot be curative; it therefore consists of such
administrations as will relieve pain, give sleep, improve the appetite,
increase the flow of urine if it be scanty, and relieve the bowels if
there is a tendency to constipation.It is as much the duty of the
physician to put off the fatal day, when he can, in incurable
affections as it is to cure those that will yield to his prescription
and advice.In the case just narrated opium or an opiate alone produced
such unpleasant after-effects that she was unwilling to take it, but
when the extract of belladonna was given with it she slept pleasantly,
and could take her food the next day.Infantile Peritonitis, or Peritonitis of Childhood.Bauer, in _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia of Practice of Medicine_, and
Wardell, in _Reynolds's System of Medicine_, have each devoted a
chapter to this form of disease.They refer to the fact that the foetus
may have peritonitis before birth or be born with it, or may have it
when a few days old.They say that this form of the disease occurs most
frequently in lying-in asylums or foundling hospitals, and that it has
been supposed to depend on a syphilitic taint.They say, too, that it
follows erysipelas, scarlet fever, measles, etc.I do not perceive that
the description of either of these authors makes any marked distinction
between this and the same disease in adults, except what may arise from
the inability of the infant to describe its sensations, and the more
rapid course of the disease to a fatal result--in some cases
twenty-four hours.Having myself had no obstetrical practice, or next
to none, I have nothing to add to their statements, and can from my own
knowledge abate nothing.I therefore refer the reader to these
chapters, and to the references given by the first of these authors,
for a fuller knowledge of the matter.Regarding the comparative exemption of children, after the first few
weeks of life, from spontaneous peritonitis, referred to by one of
these authors, I can fully confirm his statement.Though I have
assisted in the treatment of many children suffering from peritonitis,
I have difficulty in recalling to mind a single case in which the
disease was not caused by perforation of the intestine or vermiform
appendix of the caecum, and in much the greatest frequency perforation
of the appendix.B. F. Dawson,[11] after reciting a case in which the liver had
undergone a peculiar degeneration and was attended by peritonitis
before birth, states that Sir J. Y. Simpson observed nine cases in his
own practice "and notes more than a dozen from different sources."These cases seemed to have been caused by the ill-health of the mother
during gestation, or excessive labor, injuries, venereal disease, and
were mostly attended by grave disease; the viscera often, the liver;
but sometimes the mother was perfectly healthy, and the peritonitis was
the primary disease.Death almost always occurred in utero or shortly
after birth.Record_ takes the following from _Schmidt's
Jahrbucher_ for Jan.Oscar Silbermann recognizes two
varieties of peritonitis in the new-born.The non-septic or chronic is
developed usually in the first third of foetal life, and is generally
syphilitic in origin.If the peritoneum covering the intestines be
involved, as well as that over the liver and spleen, various forms of
intestinal obstruction may result.Most frequently there is occlusion
of the anus, less often stenosis or complete stricture of the small
intestine.Of a number of cases of congenital occlusion of the
intestine collected by the author, all ended fatally, only one living
beyond twelve days."The second, acute or septic, form of peritonitis in the new-born the
author divides into two varieties, according as the peritonitis is only
a part of general infection or is the sole manifestation of the septic
poison.In either case the point of entrance of the poison is always
the navel wound.The symptoms, which need not all be present in a given
case, are vomiting, watery stools, meteorism, ascites, abdominal
tenderness, icterus, etc.The pulse and temperature may vary in degree
in different cases.A cure of the septic form is possible; therefore
the treatment should be carefully considered.The navel wound should be
cleansed, and the child is to be isolated from its mother.To control
the fever quinine may be given.Priessnitz's sheet is of value;
vomiting may be checked by chloral (one-half to one grain in water).The strength should of course be maintained by stimulants if
necessary."The accumulation of fluid indicated by this name has already been
referred to in its relations to several causes.There are, however,
conditions producing it which have not been considered or only
considered partially.The most prolific source of abdominal dropsy is obstruction of the
portal circulation on its way to or through the liver.Condensation of
the liver structure in cirrhosis, with destruction of many of the
portal capillaries and compression of many more, is prominent in this
connection.The compression of the liver caused by an adventitious
external covering, referred to under the head of Local Peritonitis,
acts similarly, whether it compresses the vein at its entrance into the
liver or not, although it is not known to produce any destruction of
the portal capillaries.Some enlargements of the organ are attended by
the same result, but they are always associated with a hardening of its
structure.The disease lately called waxy liver, now often denominated
lardaceous, belongs to this class, as does that condition in which the
organ is enlarged, hardened, and fissured, regarded as syphilitic
liver.That both these diseases may have a syphilitic and mercurial
origin is not a point now under consideration.They both harden the
hepatic structure and obstruct the portal circulation, while they may
not in equal degree hinder the progress of arterial blood.This is
explained when we remember the diminished force that propels the portal
blood.Neither of these diseases produces dropsy early in its progress,
but, as I have seen it, always before it reaches its fatal termination.Fatty liver has not, in my observation, produced dropsy, {1174}
although I have seen livers made very large by that disease, and the
absence of dropsy when the liver has been large has aided me in
distinguishing it from the waxy disease.Cancer of the liver in some
instances does, and in others does not, produce dropsy of the bowels.It is only certain to have this result when a tumor is in position to
press upon and obstruct the portal.Hypertrophy of the liver, caused by
mitral regurgitation or other disease of the heart, does not generally
produce dropsy, but, aided by anaemia or watery condition of the blood,
such a result is possible.In children, however, it is not very rare to
see the bowels distended by dropsy, and to discover that the liver is
enlarged at the same time.It is common in such cases that the dropsy
and the hypertrophy disappear after a few weeks of treatment.This may
occur in a child that is anaemic, but without any disease of the heart.Such a case was brought to me two or three months ago, and after four
weeks of treatment by tonics and diuretics the health was
re-established.There is one point in these cases of some importance.When the child lies on his back, if the abdomen is much distended, the
liver cannot be felt.It has sunk away into the fluid, and in this
position ordinary percussion cannot ascertain its dimensions.In the
July number (1840) of a quarterly journal edited by Swett and Watson, I
published an article in which I reported the conjoined labors of the
late Camman and myself on a new method of combining auscultation and
percussion, with its results, under the heading "Auscultatory
Percussion."By the method described in that article--viz.by placing a
solid stethoscope, or for that Laennec's first stethoscope, a rolled-up
pamphlet, on the chest at a point where the liver has not fallen away
from its walls, and percussing on the abdomen from below upward--a
point is reached whence the percussion sound is brought sharply to the
ear, while half an inch below the sound is dull and distant.The lower
edge of the liver is thus easily recognized, and its upper boundary is
found in a similar manner or by ordinary percussion, so the difficulty
of measurement disappears.In such case, when the dropsy disappears and the liver recovers its
natural dimensions at the same time, the inference is that the
hypertrophy caused the dropsy, and that the hypertrophy was of the kind
called simple.The nutmeg liver is thought to have an agency in
producing dropsy, but as it is for the most part associated with
diseases that have been called dropsy-producing, its bearing on this
effusion may yet be regarded as uncertain.It is common to speak of heart dropsy in such a way as to imply that
disease of the heart alone can produce abdominal effusion.I even doubt whether the heart alone can cause the anasarca that is so
often attributed to it.In following a great multitude of heart
diseases from the time they were recognized to their termination, I
have been struck with the ease with which the patients attend to their
business, sometimes even laborious business, for years--in one instance
fifty years--with almost no complaint, and how rapidly their condition
changes as soon as albumen and casts appear in the urine.I have been
compelled by these observations to ascribe the anasarca and oedema that
makes this last stage of heart disease so distressing to the kidneys,
and not to the heart.Double pleuritic effusion is not uncommon under
these circumstances, but every physician must have noticed the rareness
of troublesome abdominal {1175} dropsy, while there is
sometimes--perhaps often--a little effusion; and when in the
exceptional cases there has been much, it was almost always accounted
for by a dropsy-producing change in the abdominal organs, not, perhaps,
discovered during life; so that for me, while they produce overwhelming
effusions in other parts of the system, they are minor agents in the
production of ascites.Phthisis is occasionally attended, toward its
close, by oedematous legs and albuminous urine, but I cannot report any
important relation between these and peritoneal effusion.I can say the
same of chronic bronchitis.I record this negative testimony regarding
the two last-named diseases, because I find them enumerated among the
causes of abdominal dropsy.Cancer may invade the portal vein, tumors of adjacent parts other than
those of the liver, or an aneurism may compress it and cause dropsy.Diseases of the pelvic organs, both acute
and chronic, may produce it, but then the disease would fall into the
class of those produced by chronic or subacute peritonitis.DaCosta thinks he has lately had a case of chronic peritonitis attended
by ascites.It was in a woman thirty years of age, who had been thrown
with force upon the frame of an iron bedstead, striking the lower part
of the bowels.These were not confined to
the injured part, but extended to the whole abdomen; and there was
menorrhagia.After a time there was fluid effusion in the peritoneal
cavity, which slowly increased till her state demanded relief from
tapping.The pain and
tenderness were constant symptoms all through.She slowly improved, and
at the time the case was reported it was believed that she would soon
be discharged from the hospital.The only doubt which DaCosta finds
regarding the diagnosis is in the facts that the liver was diminished
in size and that the spleen was moderately enlarged, and he admits the
possibility that an adventitious capsule of the liver may have caused
the ascites, but believes that it was dependent on chronic peritonitis.Acute peritonitis subsiding into chronic, with increase of fluid
effusion, as I have already said, I am not familiar with.That
occurring in cancerous and tuberculous peritonitis has already been
considered.But in relation to these some facts regarding frequency of
occurrence, collected by Bristowe, are worth quoting.He says that in
48 cases of tubercular peritonitis, dropsy was found in 12, and that in
22 of peritoneal cancer, 12 had more or less ascites.He further adds,
regarding cirrhosis, that of 46 cases observed post-mortem, there was
dropsy in only 20.This is not surprising, as in all the diseased
conditions of the liver that produce dropsy the anatomical changes must
reach the point at which there is considerable portal obstruction
before the effusion will occur.The amount of fluid found in ascites varies greatly.In some it may
remain for a long time stationary at four or five quarts; in others the
suffering caused by an accumulation of nine or ten quarts will demand
its removal; and in a few cases twenty quarts have been removed in one
operation.It is in cirrhosis that the largest quantity is found, and
it is in this disease and in cancerous peritonitis that the most
frequent tappings are required.The quality of the fluid also varies
markedly: from being almost as clear and thin as spring-water it may be
almost ropy, or in color greenish or yellowish or slightly red; it is
very likely to contain {1176} albumen; and it is probable that a
further study of its microscopic elements may enable us to resolve
doubts regarding the cause of the effusion.It very often contains
blood-corpuscles.Bristowe finds from hospital records that ascites occurs in about equal
frequency in males and females, but, as everybody has noticed, that
hepatic dropsy is much more frequent in men than in women.Ascites, he
says, is most frequent between the ages of thirty and fifty, and next
between twenty and thirty and between fifty and sixty, but is not
uncommon above the latter age; and it occurs in children.SYMPTOMS.--In general, ascites is easily recognized by the swollen
state of the bowels: a well-rounded swelling when the patient stands or
sits, but spread out in the flanks when he lies on his back; the
fulness of the side on which the patient may be lying, and the
flattened condition of the opposite side,--belong to this disease, and
as a group to no other.The results of percussion are significant in
the movement it causes in the fluid, and for the resonance or flatness
it produces.When the patient lies on his back, tapping with the
finger-ends on one side of the abdomen sends a wave of the fluid across
to the other side, where it is perceived as a gentle blow by the
applied fingers of the other hand.If the abdomen is not full, this
wave will be produced at the upper level of the fluid, but not above
that.If this wave cannot be sent across the body, it may be found on
either side by percussing above and feeling for it below; percussion
also teaches where the fluid is, and where it is not, by the dull sound
it produces.It is rare in ascites that the intestines do not float on
the surface of the fluid, at least from the umbilicus upward, and there
give a loud percussion sound, while toward the back, and often toward
the pelvis, it is dull, or even flat; changing the position of the
body, the resonance will be uppermost and the dulness in the most
dependent part.Then the softness or impressibility of the abdomen till
the tension becomes great is noticeable.The changed position of the
fluid as the body is turned from side to side is important.A very
small quantity of fluid can be detected in this manner.The patient is
placed on his right side and percussion is made in the right flank:
there is dulness, while in the left flank there is resonance.The
patient turns on to the left side: dulness now changes position, and is
on the left, and on the right resonance.If it is feared that some
undetected fluid remains in the pelvic cavity, the pelvis may be raised
by pillows and the same examination repeated, or he may be placed in
the knee-and-elbow position referred to by Bristowe, and the percussion
will then be made upward in the umbilical region.In some cases the
contraction of the mesentery will not allow the intestines to rise
through a large amount of fluid and float on it; but such cases are
almost confined to the cancerous and the tuberculous varieties of the
disease; and as in these the symptoms are grave, the physician will
probably have visited his patient many times before this contraction
will embarrass him.Besides, when mesenteric contraction occurs there
is a very strong probability that the omentum will also be contracted,
be rolled up, and lumpy; as this can almost always be felt above the
level of the umbilicus, he has in it an explanation of the absence of
resonance on the fluid.It has happened that oedema of the abdominal
walls or fatty accumulations there have given a delusive though feeble
fluctuation on percussion.In such cases, if the patient make moderate
pressure with the back of a small book in {1177} the course of the
median line, that kind of wave will be broken, while a wave in the
abdominal cavity will not be prevented.When there is considerable
distension of the abdomen by fluid, weak spots in the abdominal wall
often yield and make a tumor.This is very common at the umbilicus,
where a little bladder is lifted half an inch or more above the general
curve of the abdomen.The fluid frequently follows the track of
hernias.In females it has been known to press the anterior wall of the
vagina backward and downward, so as to make it protrude at the vulva.It has, in one of my own cases, by downward pressure caused complete
prolapse of the uterus.It is very often attended by oedema of the
lower limbs.This is accounted for by the pressure of the abdominal
fluid on the veins that return the blood from these parts, or in
cirrhosis by contraction of the ring or notch through which the vena
cava passes in the liver.If there is general oedema, the cause will
probably be found in disease of the kidneys; or if in one limb, in
pressure or thrombosis of one iliac vein.As the disease advances the
accumulating fluid forces the diaphragm upward, diminishes the
breathing room, and threatens the life still more.Then the patient
cannot lie down in bed, but spends his nights as well as days in an
easy-chair, and sleeps leaning forward on a support for his forehead.The veins on the abdominal surface will fix attention.With almost any
large tumor in the cavity they become more or less enlarged.But in
cirrhotic dropsy this becomes more striking than in any other
affection.The enlargement is attended by a reversion of the
blood-current on the lower half of the abdomen.This is early shown by
emptying an inch or two of a vein with the finger, drawing it either
upward or downward, and noticing from which direction it is refilled
when the pressure is removed.The pelvic veins do not readily discharge
their blood by the natural channels, and by anastomosing branches it is
forced over the surface of the abdomen and into the thoracic veins,
these latter becoming in turn greatly enlarged.The appetite is
commonly poor, the digestion flatulent, the pulse accelerated.The urine is commonly scanty, and in
cirrhosis of a reddish hue.The skin is apt to be dry, particularly so
in simple chronic peritonitis.The tongue has no characteristic fur,
and is often, almost always toward the close, dry.The mind is not
affected till near the end; then often the patient is delirious,
commonly mildly.Diarrhoea is not uncommon, and even dysentery has been
observed.The result is almost always unfavorable, or, as has been
said, lethal.When, as in chronic peritonitis
and in tuberculous peritonitis, the fluid is confined in a sac or sacs,
each particular pool will be yielding to pressure, but elastic, and
will give the percussion wave, though it may extend but a short
distance.To distinguish ovarian dropsy--ovarian cysts, as it is now
called--from ascites may require a few words.Ovarian tumors of all
kinds are found to be more prominent on one side when they rise from
the pelvis than on the other.The
uterus and its appendages lie in front of the pelvic intestine, and
when any of them ascend above the pelvis they must occupy the same
relative position.In other words, a large ovarian cyst must lie in
front of the intestines, while intestinal resonance should be found
behind and in the sides.But if the ovarian cyst does not occupy the
whole height of the bowels, intestinal resonance {1178} may exist above
it, and the dulness may be found below, bounded by a portion of a
circle, and sometimes the cyst walls are resisting enough to allow its
boundaries to be ascertained by the fingers.This cyst can also be felt
in the vagina; and the uterus, instead of being pressed down, is
sometimes lifted upward, so that it cannot be reached in the vagina,
but can be felt through the abdominal walls just above the pelvic
bones.A condition more troublesome than this is when ovarian cyst and
ascites occur together.Then the posterior or lateral resonance is lost
when the patient lies on her back, but can be found on one side when
she lies on the other.In that concurrence, in dorsal decubitus it is
possible by pressure or a little blow to send a wave of the ascitic
fluid over the front of the cyst.Should the patient take the knee-and-elbow position, the intestinal
resonance may be restored in both flanks.TREATMENT.--In opening the chapter on the treatment of ascites it is
usually said, Give principal consideration to the diseased conditions
that have caused the dropsy; in other words, cure cirrhosis, cancerous
peritonitis, tubercular peritonitis, heart disease, and the secondary
affections of the abdominal organs, release the liver from the
dangerous compression to which it is subjected, and all will go well.But they do not inform us how these impossibilities--at least in most
cases impossibilities--are to be achieved.It is true that the
physician would not shrink hopelessly from the treatment of simple
chronic peritonitis.But this is one of the rarest causes of ascites.A
physician in a long lifetime may not have seen a case.It is true,
ascites is a symptom, always a secondary, or even a tertiary,
affection; and theoretically there can be no better advice, but
practically it cannot amount to much.Then, if the cause cannot be
removed, it remains to do our best to relieve the patient of his load
and strive to prolong his life to its utmost possible limit.In doing
this the physician will often find himself able to give gratifying
relief, and once in a great while to rejoice in a cure.The three great emunctories, the skin, the bowels, and the kidneys, are
chiefly appealed to for relief in this as in other serous
accumulations.Most physicians prefer to use the diuretics--first,
because if they will act at all, they act so quietly and produce so
little debility that whatever can be gained by them is obtained at
small cost to the system.The form of ascites that most resists
diuretics is that which originates in cirrhosis.Often a full trial of
them, with suitable changes from time to time, is of no avail, yet now
and then the kidneys yield to persuasion and act freely.The saline
diuretics and digitalis are most in favor with some.In the early part
of the present century a pill composed of squill and digitalis in
powder, and calomel, each one grain, given three times a day, was
almost universally chosen.In place of the calomel the blue mass was
often preferred.When this prescription had produced a little ptyalism
the mercurial was omitted and the squill and digitalis continued.It
has often been observed in dropsies of all kinds that diuretics act
better after a little mercurial action is set up in the system.The
diuretic that I most frequently prescribe is made of the carbonate of
potass.ounce ss and water ounce vj; to a tablespoonful of this a
tablespoonful of fresh lemon-juice is added.This is taken every two
hours, and at the same time a dessertspoonful of the infusion of
digitalis or more is taken three times a day.This is an {1179} old
prescription.Sometimes the old sal diureticus is used.It is not always kindly received by the stomach.At Bellevue Hospital the following is much used: viz.infusion of
digitalis, ounce iv; bitartrate of potash, ounce j; simple syrup, ounce
ss; and water added to make a pint.But it
would require many pages to exhaust the diuretics.I will only add that
I have more confidence in the salts of potash and soda, singly or
combined, aided by digitalis and a mercurial, than in any others.The diaphoretics that are most efficient are warm water and steam.A
foot-bath long continued and frequently repeated, the patient covered
with blankets, and the water kept at 90 degrees or warmer, are very
effectual in producing perspiration.Bricks heated or hot water in
bottles, or potatoes heated, and enveloped in damp cloths and laid
alongside of the body and limbs, form an extemporaneous vapor-bath of
considerable efficiency.A vapor-bath can be easily extemporized in the
following way: Have a kitchen vessel furnished by the tinman with a
cover which has an inch tube fitted to this and bent so as reach the
floor six feet from the fire.The pot should have a capacity of a
gallon or more, and should be kept boiling briskly.Meantime, the
patient, in his night-dress, has a double blanket brought over his
shoulders from behind, and another from before, and fastened.Now he
takes a chair (wooden), under which the steam is delivered.The blanket
from behind is kept off his body by the back of the chair, and the
front one by his knees.The steam, shut in in this way, soon brings on
a sweat, and when it is sufficiently active the front blanket is thrown
off, and the patient wrapped in the rear one and put to bed, when the
sweating can be regulated by blankets.This is better than what is
called the alcohol sweat, for in that the patient is bathed in carbonic
acid gas as well as heat.A patient is sometimes enveloped in a hot,
wet blanket with good effect.Pilocarpine has come into use lately as a
sudorific.I have witnessed its effects many times and can testify to
its certainty as a sudorific; but it is too debilitating for common
use.Digitalis has sometimes acted with extraordinary power in this
way, but there are grave risks in administering large doses.Among the cathartics that may be used in ascites, it has seemed to me
that the milder hydragogues are safest.One ounce of Epsom salts with a
drachm of the fluid extract of senna can be taken every second or third
day for months, if need be, with little reduction of strength, and
sometimes with an increase of it.I had charge of a young man in the
hospital in whom cirrhosis was unquestionable, and dropsy at one time
extreme, in whom the abdominal veins had made furrows that would
receive the little finger, who was wholly relieved by a drastic dose of
elaterium every second day.I saw him three years after his discharge,
and then his health was good.Notwithstanding this, I prefer the milder
medicines.Bristowe has seen no cures from either sudorifics, diuretics, or
purgatives.I have seen one or more from each of those agents, all
cirrhotic.He "has seen cures occasionally from mercury, iodide and
bromide of potash, copaiba, and a combination of fresh squills and
crude mercury."I agree with him in his statement that
counter-irritants are useless, making exception for chronic peritonitis
and the early stage of the tubercular variety.He thinks quinia, iron,
and cod-liver oil are useful.{1180} Paracentesis in almost every case will at length become
necessary, and the question comes whether it should be practised early
or late.If it be delayed till the oppression of the breathing makes it
imperative, the walls of the abdomen will be so stretched as to present
little resistance to the reaccumulation of the fluid, and a second
tapping will be required in fifteen to twenty-five days.A bandage is a
poor substitute for muscular contraction.If, on the other hand, the
fluid is withdrawn before the muscularity is not stretched out of the
muscles, then accumulation will be less rapid and the patient will be
spared the suffering which large accumulations cause.But tapping is
not always an innocent operation.It is sometimes followed by acute
peritonitis.By the early tapping this risk is oftener taken.Reginald
Smith suggests the use of a small canula by which only ten or twenty
ounces of the fluid can escape each hour.This mode, he thinks, removes
the danger of syncope and makes the bandage needless.Hemorrhagic Effusion

in the peritoneum is a topic on which there is little to be said.A
primary effusion of this kind probably does not occur.In
haematophilia, where the mucous membrane of the nose and wounds bleed
dangerously, there is no record of spontaneous bleeding into the
peritoneal cavity.The same thing can be said of that very rare disease
which has been called bloody sweat.An unmarried lady applied to me
fifteen years ago with this disorder.The blood would ooze out at
hundreds of points on the inner face of the arm; these would run
together and drop off the arm, or the same thing would occur on the
chest and in the bend of the knee.This would continue for two or three
minutes, and then cease of itself, but to recur in one or more, rarely
several, places.There was no
irregularity of the menses.I could find no visceral disease; there was
no nose-bleed.This kind of
bleeding continued for several years.She is now approaching fifty
years of age, and for the last two or three years has had no recurrence
of the bleeding.There was never anything in this case to lead to the
suspicion of peritoneal or other serous hemorrhage.In the few similar
cases on record there is the same absence of all evidence of internal
bleeding.It has already been said that a certain amount of blood, as shown by
its corpuscles, is to be expected in cancerous ascites, and with less
uniformity in tubercular ascites, and not unfrequently in hepatic
dropsy, as well as in acute peritonitis.This may not deserve to be
called hemorrhage, on account of the moderate quantity of blood that is
effused; but aside from that which results from rupture of
blood-vessels it is about the only kind of it with which we are
familiar.Scurvy, and conditions of the blood analogous to those produced by that
disease, make it almost certain that if pleurisy or pericarditis occurs
while these conditions exist, it will be hemorrhagic.I am not,
personally, acquainted with a single instance in which peritonitis in
this condition has occurred.Copeland, however, says that hemorrhage in
peritonitis has been noticed by Broussais and others.The blood is
mixed {1181} with the serum and stains the surface of the false
membrane, as in hemorrhagic pleurisy and pericarditis, and the disease
is of an asthenic type, "occurring in the hemorrhagic diathesis.""The
symptoms are inflammatory from the beginning, and rapidly pass into
those indicating great depression; the pulse becomes rapid, small, and
soft, death quickly supervening, with convulsions, cold and damp
extremities and surface," etc.Copeland has himself not seen a case, and regards its occurrence as
very rare.Delafield states that "Friedreich describes two cases
occurring in patients with ascites who had been frequently tapped.He
says that both the parietal and visceral peritoneum was covered with a
continuous membrane of a diffuse, yellowish-brown color, mottled with
small and large extravasations of blood.The membrane was thickest over
the anterior abdominal wall.It could be separated into a number of
layers.These layers were composed of blood-vessels, masses of pigment,
branching cells, and fibrillated basement substance.In many places the
extravasated blood was coagulated in the shape of round, hard, black
nodules.The new membrane could be readily stripped off from the
peritoneum, and there were no adhesions between the visceral and
parietal portions of the peritoneum."The erosions of abdominal cancer sometimes open vessels of considerable
size, causing large hemorrhage into this cavity and sudden death.When aneurisms of the abdominal aorta rupture, they sometimes flood the
abdominal cavity; oftener they open into the structures under the
peritoneum on the left side, and make a large flat tumor extending from
the point of rupture downward to the brim of the pelvis, and even
beyond it.A gentleman whose health was usually good, thirty-five years of age,
felt an unwonted exhaustion and feebleness creeping over him.His
countenance became pale, his pulse rapid, growing smaller and smaller.It seemed certain that there was hemorrhage somewhere, but until it was
noticed that the bowels were growing tumid and hard there was nothing
to guide us to its seat.Even then we were left to conjecture regarding
the bleeding vessel.After
death it was found that a small aneurism had been formed on one of the
vessels of the omentum, not larger than a small walnut, and had
ruptured by a very small opening, and that it was by this small opening
that life had oozed away.Bleedings from stabs and other wounds of the bowels, from lacerations
of the liver, spleen, uterus, and sometimes of the kidneys, should be
mentioned in this connection; but as they, for the most part, fall into
the hands of the surgeons, this is not the place to give the details
regarding them.{1182}

DISEASES OF THE ABDOMINAL GLANDS (TABES MESENTERICA).BY SAMUEL C. BUSEY, M.D.DEFINITION.--Tabes mesenterica may be briefly defined to be
tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.This definition may seem too
limited, because it recognizes the identity of tuberculosis and
scrofulosis of the lymph-glands, and excludes those hyperplastic
conditions which do not certainly undergo the cheesy degeneration.It
is supported, however, by the absence of any essential difference in
the histological changes which take place in tuberculous and scrofulous
(Wagner) lymph-glands; by the frequent simultaneous occurrence of each
in the same subject; by the secondary development of tubercles during
the course of scrofulous affections; and by the fact that the cheesy
transformation is alike common to both these conditions of new
formations.Schuppel maintains that the presence of tubercles is
necessary to the production of the cheesy metamorphosis of
lymph-glands, and that "scrofulous glands are always tuberculous
glands."In this view Rindfleisch coincides, and expresses the belief
that the inflammatory and hyperplastic changes are secondary to the
formation of the tubercles.Birch-Hirschfeld asserts that cheesy
degeneration of the mesenteric glands is always accompanied by
tubercular formations.This definition is therefore adopted as the expression of the result of
the most recent investigations.It must, nevertheless, be admitted that
a few equally competent observers deny the identity of the tuberculous
and scrofulous new formations in lymph-glands.It must also be conceded
that occasionally hyperplastic processes in the lymph-glands undergo
the cheesy metamorphosis independent of tubercular development.SYNONYMS.--The differences of opinion, especially among the older
authors, in regard to the nature of this disease are very distinctly
indicated in the varying significance of the numerous synonyms, of
which the following list is only a part: Atrophia mesenterica; Atrophia
infantum (Hoffmann); Febris hectica infantum (Sydenham); Scrofula
mesenterica (Sauvages); Paralysma mesentericum (Good); Physconia
mesenterica (Baumes); Mesenteritis chronica (Stewart); Mesenteric
fever, Hectic fever, Marasmus (Underwood); Carreau, Entero-mesenterite
of the French; Darrsucht der Kinder and Gekroschwindsucht of the
Germans; Tubercles of the mesentery; Tuberculous disease of the
abdomen; Phthisis mesenterica; Tabes glandularis; Tabes scrofulosa;
Macies infantum; Paedatrophia; and Rachialgia mesenterica.{1183} Some of these synonyms indicate the theoretical and unsupported
opinions of their authors, and others refer merely to a symptom.The
name carreau refers to a hardness of the abdomen; physconia, to the
presence of a non-fluctuating and non-sonorous abdominal tumor; and
that of entero-mesenterite presupposes a secondary origin from a
primary enteritis.Good classes it among his numerous varieties of
mesenteric turgescence, but characterizes this special form as a
scrofulous turgescence always associated with the strumous diathesis.The terms tabes and atrophy originated when the nomenclature of disease
was derived from symptoms, and not from pathology.HISTORY AND PATHOLOGY.--The history of tabes mesenterica is coeval with
that of scrofula and pulmonary consumption.The ancient authors
recognized the existence of a chronic disease of the mesenteric glands,
characterized by enlargement and induration, followed by destruction of
the gland-parenchyma, which was associated with digestive disturbances,
emaciation, hectic fever, and usually terminated in death.At first,
the degenerative process was regarded as suppurative.But as the study
of scrofula progressed, and frequent observations were made of the
occurrence of disease of the external lymphatics and of the mesenteric
glands in the same subject, disputes arose as to the identity of the
two affections.These controversies led to the general acceptance of
the belief that the scrofulous degeneration of lymph-glands and the
process of destruction in tabes mesenterica were identical.Consentaneous with these investigations, and for a long time
subsequent, even down to a very late period, which is, perhaps, not yet
concluded, the relation of scrofulous disease of the lymph-glands to
pulmonary consumption was discussed and studied with great assiduity.As the knowledge concerning these diseases advanced, and the results of
investigations were accepted, the doctrine of the identity of the
morbid processes in scrofulous disease of the external glands and
mesenteric phthisis became firmly established.The history of
scrofulosis and tuberculosis cannot be separated.The connection and
identification of the two processes have been subjects of constant
discussion from the discovery of tubercle to the present time.Occasionally, the dividing-line seemed definitely fixed.Then would
follow the general acceptance of the doctrine of identity.With the
discovery of miliary tubercle a determined reaction took place against
this view, and for a while many regarded scrofulosis merely as a form
or stage of tuberculosis.As the conclusions in regard to these
questions changed, so did the opinions concerning the true nature of
tabes mesenterica change, until, finally, the investigations of
Rindfleisch, Schuppel, and others seem to have established the
tuberculous nature of the disease.Many authors of a comparatively
recent date have applied the term tuberculosis to this condition, not
because they knew or believed the development of true tubercle was a
constant or essential characteristic, but because they regarded the
words scrofulosis and tuberculosis as synonymous.Notwithstanding the obscurity in which, for so long a time, the
pathology of this disease was involved, certain facts well known to the
earliest writers have been confirmed by continuous observation down to
the present.Its secondary character has been so uniformly recognized
that some of the older authors based its origin upon the absorption and
conveyance along the lymphatic vessels to the glands of some peccant
material originating {1184} in a primary focus of disease.The constant
coexistence with scrofulous affections and pulmonary consumption had
long ago established the direct and primary relation of these diseases
to tabes mesenterica, and authors of recent date, though not so
generally holding the opinion that it is always an intercurrent
complication of these maladies, yet maintain its secondary development.Even Schuppel, whose investigations and conclusions lead in the
direction of an idiopathic origin, admits that the only primary element
is the tuberculosis, which finds its cause in some peripheral
irritation.In the earlier times, as now, tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands has
been observed during every period of life from birth to advanced old
age, but then, as at the present time, the greater number of cases were
known to occur during infancy and childhood.But few cases have been
observed during the earlier months of life or before weaning.Between
the ages of two and eight years is the period of greatest frequency.Though rarer during the later years of childhood, the older the child
the more rapid its progress to a fatal termination.Nursing infants are
not exempt, but those nursed by healthy mothers are much less liable
than the wet-nursed.Among hand-fed infants it is not an uncommon
disease, but it is much more common among the farmed-out children.While, as has been stated, the greatest number of cases occur in those
between two and eight years of age, statistics show that the liability
to it increases from the age of two and a half years up to the eighth,
and, according to some authors, up to the tenth year.At the latter age
there is a remarkable diminution in the number of cases.This fact is
probably due to the greater prevalence of the acute diseases of the
respiratory organs and of the exanthematous diseases among children
during this period of life.Some have attributed it to the more rapid
development and increased functional activity of the mesenteric glands.This circumstance might afford a plausible explanation for the apparent
sudden increase in frequency after the completion of the second year
because of the independent subsistence of children at that age, and the
additional duties imposed upon the alimentary tract and its
dependencies; still, if this were so, the period of greatest frequency
ought to begin at an earlier age and more nearly correspond with the
time of weaning.It is, however, a fact that tubercularization of the
mesenteric glands is more frequently associated with chronic intestinal
inflammation in those over one year than in those under that age.This
fact, together with the greater liability of artificially-fed infants,
would seem to connect, at least in such cases, its secondary origin
with some primary irritation of the intestinal canal.Authors are not yet agreed in regard to the relative frequency of this
disease in boys and girls, though opinions predominate in favor of the
greater number among the males.The statistics of Rilliet and Barthez
and Schmalz show a decidedly greater prevalence among boys.The comparative frequency of tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands
cannot be determined.Louis found disease of the mesenteric glands in
one-fourth of the autopsies of persons dying of phthisis; in 100 adults
dying of the same disease Lombard found tuberculosis of these glands in
10; and in the bodies of 100 tuberculous children he found the glands
tuberculous in 34 cases.In the Hopital des Enfants Maladies tubercles
were found in the mesentery of one-half of the children dying of {1185}
tuberculous affections.In the bodies of children dying of tuberculous
disease in the Children's Hospital of Washington tuberculous
degeneration of the mesenteric glands has been found in two-thirds of
the cases, and without a single exception in those dying of rickets.Authors differ also, and the statistics are equally unreliable, in
regard to the relative frequency of tubercularization of the bronchial
and mesenteric glands.The general opinion seems to be in favor of the
greater frequency in the bronchial glands.In a majority of cases both
sets of glands are found diseased.The geographical distribution of tabes mesenterica is as universal as
that of scrofula and pulmonary phthisis.No country or climate is
exempt, yet there is no locality in which it is endemic.It has been
observed among all civilized nations, in the cold regions as well as in
the tropical countries.Wherever scrofulous and phthisical diseases are
known, there also are found cases of tabes mesenterica.Livingstone has
stated that scrofula is unknown in some regions in Central Africa, and
other travellers have made similar statements in regard to some Indian
tribes.The statistics of the Children's Hospital of Washington show a
far greater frequency among the African race than among the whites.It
belongs to no class or condition of life, but occurs more frequently
among the children of the squalid than among the children of the
affluent and well-to-do.ETIOLOGY.--Predisposing Causes.--Modern as well as the older authors
have very generally accepted the conclusion that a constitutional
tendency or liability to this disease is its most frequent and
potential etiological factor.This predisposition may be either
inherited or acquired.The ancients called it the strumous, and the
more recent writers the scrofulous or tuberculous, diathesis.Lugol
maintained that this diathesis is begotten of old and syphilitic
fathers, and others state that children of parents nearly related and
of those broken down by disease and excesses may inherit it.That it is
transmitted by scrofulous and phthisical parents no one can doubt, but
as yet it cannot be defined to be anything more than a peculiarity of
the constitution which may exhibit abnormal reactions against
irritating influences.The scrofulous habit is believed to be indicated
by physical appearances which represent two extremes.The erethic form
is characterized by a feeble and delicate frame; deficient muscular
development; transparent, smooth, and florid skin; light hair and blue
eyes, large pupils; precocious intellect and sanguine temperament; the
torpid form, by a large head; large and tumid upper lip; soft and
flaccid flesh, bloated appearance; short and thick neck; muscular
incapacity, tumid abdomen, and sluggish intellect.Some of these
features are more frequently symptoms of the actual disease than of the
existence of a predisposition to it, and, except so far as they may
refer to a primary scrofulous or pulmonary disease, cannot be accepted
as indicative of the presence of a constitutional tendency to
tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.A tumid abdomen, rapid
emaciation, and anaemia are far more valuable signs of the disease of
these glands.Bad air and bad food are also important predisposing causes.They are
conditions to which the children of the poor, especially in large
cities, are constantly exposed.Insufficient protection from climatic
influences, neglect of person, and unhygienic surroundings must be
classed in the same category.It is claimed that vitiated air,
unwholesome habitation, {1186} insufficient or improper food, squalor
and filth may cause the constitutional tendency, as they will certainly
precipitate the development of the disease in those predisposed to it.Exciting Causes.--The border-line between the predisposing and exciting
causes cannot be positively fixed.The presence of tuberculosis or of
some form of scrofulous disease in some other part of the body so
constantly precedes the development of tuberculosis of the mesenteric
glands, even in those who have not exhibited the characteristic
phenomena of the scrofulous diathesis, that such affections must be
regarded as exciting as well as predisposing causes.No one can doubt
the frequent infection of the mesenteric glands in cases of pulmonary
tuberculosis.The probability of systemic infection from a single focus
is universally admitted.These facts and circumstances do not exclude
the possibility of localized tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.Whether such exclusively local development of tubercles ever occurs
independent of the scrofulous diathesis cannot be determined, but that
the disease does find its exciting cause in inflammatory conditions of
the intestinal mucous membrane cannot be doubted.Schuppel, who asserts
the primary development of the tubercle-formation in lymphatic glands,
does not claim an idiopathic origin, but admits the necessity of a
primary peripheral irritation in direct connection with the affected
gland.The intimate connection between diseases of the intestinal
mucous membrane and of the mesenteric glands is established beyond a
doubt.Vogel and Steiner assert that tabes mesenterica is a common
result of enteritis folliculosa.A primary inflammatory process may not
contain any element which could be classed as tubercle, yet it may
excite secondary tuberculosis of the glands.Whether such a result only
occurs in those who may have acquired or inherited the predisposition
is yet undecided.In many of the cases of tabes mesenterica tuberculous
ulcers are found in the intestines, but it cannot be claimed that such
ulcers are always the primary foci of tuberculous development.If
primary, it is not difficult to understand how the virus may be
transmitted to the glands.It has been claimed that certain articles of food will produce the
disease.Potatoes and rye bread in large quantities and a coarse
vegetable diet have been mentioned among the exciting causes.Deficiency in the quantity of food is a much more frequent cause than
inferiority in quality, yet there can be no doubt that any and every
article of diet that will set up catarrhal inflammation of the
intestinal mucous membrane may become a cause.Irritation of the mucous
membrane of the alimentary tract, induced by coarse, stimulating, or
imperfectly-digested food, or by the improper and frequent use of
purgative medicines, may give rise to disease of the glands; and, even
though the irritation may in itself be trivial, its long continuance or
frequent renewal may prove sufficient, especially in those in whom the
predisposition is present.Malarial and exanthematous diseases have
also been considered exciting causes, and among the latter class
measles and scarlet fever, because of the inflamed condition of the
intestinal mucous membrane which they leave, are the most frequent.Difficult dentition and whooping cough must also be classed in this
category.Recently attention has been called to the probable transmission of the
disease through the milk of diseased cows, but further investigation
and {1187} more reliable data are necessary to establish this
connection.Klebs has deduced the conclusion from recent experiments
that the use of the milk of cows in advanced phthisis will always
produce tuberculosis, which begins as an intestinal catarrh and extends
to the mesenteric glands.Some of the older authors believed that the cure of some chronic
diseases of the skin and mucous membranes and the suppression of
chronic discharges might induce tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands;
but these conditions are now known to be most frequently the initial
manifestations of the scrofulous diathesis, and the mesenteric
complications are far more likely to occur when these primary foci are
neglected and the patient is left to suffer the unabated progress of
the disease.MORBID ANATOMY.--It is not usual to find all the glands of the
mesentery affected at once, nor of those affected all in the same stage
of disease.Newly-affected glands may be found alongside of others in
an advanced condition.In the first stage the glands are enlarged, but
rarely exceeding the size of a filbert; they are firm, but not
inelastic.This change consists in hyperplasia of the
gland-constituents.Microscopic examination shows abundant
cell-proliferation, but the cells are badly constructed and prone to
undergo retrogressive metamorphosis.The cells accumulate in clusters
without any intercellular substance, and compress the lymph-sinuses and
blood-vessels.The second stage is characterized by the commencement of the cheesy
degeneration.The glands enlarge and coalesce in clusters, sometimes
forming large masses of hardened and inelastic glands.On section they
exhibit in the beginning foci of cheesy material imbedded in the
gland-parenchyma.In the further progress of the change the whole gland
is transformed into a homogeneous yellowish substance.In this
condition there are found on microscopic examination globular
corpuscles, nuclei, shrivelled cells, sometimes giant-cells, and most
frequently tubercles.The tubercles are usually found in the follicular
substance.Birch-Hirschfield says the cheesy formations in secondary
tuberculous mesenteric glands are only found in discrete foci, and the
tubercles occur in the follicular substance imbedded in relatively
normal tissue.The cheesy transformation is, according to Virchow, a
necrobiosis of the hyperplastic gland-elements, but Schuppel insists
that it is the result of tubercular development.After a time the
cheesy masses soften, and the glands are converted into sacs containing
a purulent fluid mixed with debris.In this condition they are most
frequently coalesced in bunches, sometimes forming large tumors.The
intervening walls may break down and the whole bunch be transformed
into one large sac filled with purulent fluid and debris.Occasionally
these masses of agglutinated glands become adherent to the abdominal
parietes or to the intestines.Rupture of their walls may occur, and
the contents may be emptied into either the peritoneal cavity or the
intestines.When communication with the intestines takes place, it is
usually through an ulcer on the mucous surface.It is probable that the
cheesy substance may sometimes be absorbed, as Virchow thinks, by
gradual softening proceeding from the surface toward the centre.It is believed that these degenerated glands sometimes undergo the
cretaceous transformation.Such an instance has been reported by
Carswell: "The patient, who when a child had been affected with tabes
{1188} mesenterica and also with swellings of the cervical glands, some
of which ulcerated, died at the age of twenty-one years of inflammation
of the uterus seven days after delivery.Several of the mesenteric
glands contained a dry cheesy matter mixed with a chalky-looking
substance; others were composed of a cretaceous substance; and a tumor
as large as a hen's egg, included within the folds of the peritoneum,
and which appeared to be the remains of a large agglomerated mass of
glands, was filled with a substance resembling a mixture of putty and
dried mortar, moistened with a small quantity of serosity.In the neck,
and immediately behind an old cicatrix in the skin, there were two
glands containing, in several points of their substance, small masses
of hard cretaceous matter."Calcareous concretions have been observed
by Andral and others in the mesenteric glands in cases of chronic
pulmonary disease; and Soemmering records several observations of a
tartar-like substance found in devastated mesenteric glands in cases of
rickets.The morbid appearances in tabes mesenterica are not usually confined to
the changes in the glands.In very many cases the evidences of disease
of the peripheral glands are quite manifest, and in much the larger
number of cases pulmonary phthisis and disease of the bronchial glands
are present.These
consecutive morbid changes are succinctly set forth in the following
notes of an autopsy taken from the records of the Children's Hospital
of Washington, D.C.The subject was a <DW64> boy aged ten, who had been
taken sick a year previous to his death with a bad cold and cough,
followed several months afterward by enlargement and suppuration of the
cervical glands on both sides: "The body was greatly emaciated, the
lips and teeth covered with sordes.Cheesy masses were scattered
throughout the substance of both lungs.The right lung was firmly
adherent to the thoracic walls, the left adherent at apex.The liver
was enlarged and adherent to all adjacent tissues, and contained many
cheesy nodules scattered throughout its substance and over the surface.The gall-bladder was distended with bile.The spleen was normal in
size, very dark, and filled with cheesy masses.The pancreas contained
many similar masses.The peritoneal cavity contained a quantity of
muddy fluid.The peritoneum was dark in color, studded with tubercles,
and ulcerated in a few places.The stomach and intestines were
distended with gas; the walls of stomach thickened, the inner surface
covered with a shiny mucus; in its lower wall was one large ulcer,
penetrating to the peritoneal coat and measuring three-fourths of an
inch in diameter.The peritoneal coat was thickly studded with nodules
resembling tubercles.The small intestines were gangrenous in a few
places; on the inner surface were found fourteen ulcers, varying in
size from one-fourth to one and one-fourth inches in diameter, with
elevated edges and red bases; two penetrated the peritoneal coat.On the mucous surface of the large
intestines there were seven large ulcers, similar in appearance to
those found in the small intestines.Some of Peyer's patches were
ulcerated.The mesenteric glands, some as large as walnuts, were filled
with cheesy material, and the mesentery was dotted over with small
masses of similar matter."In two of the reported cases of chylous effusion into the peritoneal
cavity the rupture of the lacteals was caused by degeneration of the
{1189} mesenteric glands; and in several other cases the rupture was
produced by the presence of tumors, apparently formed by the
agglomeration of numerous degenerated glands.Several cases of fatty diarrhoea from mesenteric phthisis have been
reported.Of these the most conclusive is the case of Hall.[1] The
clinical history of the case and the detection of enlarged mesenteric
glands in the umbilical and hypogastric regions placed the diagnosis
beyond a doubt.It was, however, verified by the discovery of several
vomicae in the lungs, and of mesenteric glands "universally enlarged
and affected with strumous disease.The intestinal mucous membrane was
dotted with patches of ulceration, with here and there prominent masses
of strumous deposit on the surface."[Footnote 1: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, vol.i., 3d Series, 1855, p.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--It is not possible to describe a definite and uniform
clinical history of this disease.As a secondary complication of
pulmonary phthisis and scrofulous affections the preliminary symptoms
are so constantly identified with the development and progress of these
maladies that, as a rule, the initial stage cannot be recognized by any
special assemblage of symptoms.In any tuberculous or scrofulous child
the possible implication of the mesenteric glands may be predicated
upon any array of symptoms that would establish the presence of these
classes of disease.And even in the absence of the rational and direct
signs of such affections, in those exhibiting the physical evidences of
the strumous diathesis, more especially when it is inherited, the
symptoms of any trivial departure from health, such as the catching of
cold, irritation of the alimentary tract, or protracted convalescence
from any of the exanthematous or intestinal diseases, may constitute
the initial history of tabes mesenterica.In such subjects debility and
anaemia, from whatsoever cause they may apparently result--and, in
fact, any manifest lowering of the standard of health, whether gradual
or precipitate, and without assignable cause--may mark the beginning of
the process of change in the parenchyma of the glands that will
terminate in tuberculosis.The later as well as the earlier history may
be completely masked by the symptomatology of other diseases belonging
to the tuberculous class; and so grave, as a rule, are such primary and
coexisting affections that definite recognition of this complication or
localized extension of the systemic infection becomes more a matter of
skilful diagnosis than of practical utility.But in those cases where disease of the respiratory organs and of the
bronchial glands can be excluded the general symptomatology becomes of
paramount importance.And in view of the value of prophylactic measures
which may be employed to arrest, limit, or delay the localized
tuberculosis of these glands, the precursory symptoms may be of special
significance.This condition may be characterized by languor and
dulness or marked debility and anaemia, with loss of color, attended
with flatulence, stomachal disturbance, frequent eructations consisting
mainly of mucus, a sense of uneasiness in the abdomen after the
ingestion of food, a variable appetite, sometimes voracious and
occasionally depraved.Sometimes a dislike for fatty foods is a
prominent symptom.The tongue may be coated, the breath is usually
foul, and some have said the body emits an acid odor.If these symptoms
occur in a child of the {1190} scrofulous diathesis, or be directly or
remotely associated with a previous gastro-intestinal disease, or occur
or persist during the convalescence of some of the acute affections of
infancy and childhood which stand in etiological relation to this
disease, they may justify a reasonable presumption of commencing change
in the mesenteric glands.This presumption will be strengthened by
emaciation, a more marked disturbance of the digestive function,
attended with fetid and occasionally whitish stools, a tumid belly, and
deep, lancinating abdominal pains of short duration, recurring at long
intervals and neither relieved nor aggravated by pressure or an
evacuation.Some have attributed special importance to a chalky
appearance and loss of consistency of the stools, indicating the
suspension of absorption by the lacteals.There may also be slight
evening fever.Later, the enlargement of the belly increases, the
emaciation becomes more marked and rapid, the appetite more variable,
sometimes very voracious, the alvine discharges more fetid or less
consistent, sometimes putty-like, and generally irregular or
constipated.The febrile exacerbations are more decided, and sometimes
chills may occur at irregular intervals.When, in addition to these
symptoms, either during the earlier or later stages, the enlargement of
the glands can be detected, the clinical picture is complete.In
consequence of the tympanitic distension of the abdomen, which usually
increases with the progress of the disease, it is impossible in a
majority of cases to detect the glandular enlargement; especially is
this true when the affected glands are separate; but, as frequently
happens during the last stage, when large tumors are formed by the
coalescence of a number of diseased glands the diagnosis may be easily
determined.In the absence of the discovery of enlarged glands the
diagnosis cannot be considered positive.They are usually most readily
found in the region of the umbilicus, and may in some cases, even when
the tension of the abdomen is very great, be detected by grasping the
abdomen with the hand and compressing it between the fingers and thumb
so that the enlarged glands will be brought in close contiguity to the
walls and be felt immediately under the fingers.If a tumor should be
present and the peritoneal cavity be free from fluid, its locality may
be recognized by a sense of resistance and circumscribed area of
diminished resonance, and then definitely outlined by palpation.Underwood says: "Indigestion, costiveness or purging, irregular
appetite, flushed cheeks or a total loss of color, impaired strength
and spirits, remitting fever, and a hard and tumid belly, with
emaciated limbs, are amongst the more common symptoms, attending at one
period or other, of this disease."When the diagnosis has been made out, it is not impossible to determine
the stage of the disease.The progressive intensity of the symptoms,
with rapid emaciation as a rule, bears a definite relation to the
progress of the morbid changes taking place in the glands.It must,
however, be borne in mind that children have died of tabes mesenterica
who had enjoyed excellent health up to the moment of death, and the
autopsy disclosed the condition of the glands, which had not been
suspected during life.In the case previously cited, in which the
autopsy exhibited such grave lesions of the stomach, liver, spleen,
pancreas, and intestinal mucous membrane, the clinical phenomena were
at no time commensurate with the gravity of the morbid changes.{1191} DIAGNOSIS.--In the absence of the proof of the presence of
enlarged glands or of a tumor the diagnosis cannot be positively
determined.The enlargement and tympanitic distension of the abdomen do
not necessarily establish the existence of glandular disease, for they
are present in a great many conditions of ill-health in children.Nor
is the coexistence of a tumid belly, emaciation, and fever sufficient,
for they are found in other tuberculous and in gastro-intestinal
diseases.The discovery of enlarged discrete glands by palpation, as
before described, in connection with such disturbances of nutrition as
have been set forth, constitute the strongest presumption in favor of
tabes mesenterica.The presence of enlarged glands unaccompanied by the
ordinary symptoms of the tuberculous or scrofulous processes is
inconclusive, because the glandular hypertrophy may be a simple
hyperplasia, entirely independent of any tendency to retrogressive
metamorphosis.There is usually some tenderness on pressure, but this
may be present in any disease of the abdominal viscera.When the glands
are of sufficient size, they may, by pressure, produce secondary
derangements.Cramps in the legs may be caused by pressure on nerves.Oedema of the legs and dilatation of the superficial abdominal veins
may result from compression of venous trunks."If," says Eustace Smith,
"these veins are seen to ramify on the abdominal surface and to join
the veins on the thoracic walls, tabes may be suspected in the absence
of chronic peritonitis and enlargement of the liver."Ascites may be
present, but is not a necessary result of disease of the glands.When a tumor has been discovered by palpation, it is necessary to
determine its glandular nature.If situated about the umbilicus, in
front of the spinal column, if irregular, hard, and feeling like a
congeries of irregularly-rounded nodules, the evidence is very decided
in favor of its glandular origin.But care must be taken to exclude
tumors formed by fecal accumulations and masses attached to the
omentum.Omental tumors are usually more movable, better defined, more
superficial, and regular in form.Cancerous masses sometimes simulate
glandular tumors.The general history of the case and the age of the
patient are usually sufficient to make a diagnosis by exclusion.Rilliet and Barthez distinguished a cancerous pancreas by the presence
of vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pains.The writer has many times based a conjectural diagnosis--which was
verified by a post-mortem examination--upon the presence of a tumid
abdomen, increasing emaciation, with the history of a protracted
gastro-intestinal catarrh, and an irregular febrile curve characterized
by frequent subnormal temperatures.He has also observed a number of
cases of protracted diarrhoea in children, accompanied with extreme
emaciation, notwithstanding the appetite was good, sometimes even
voracious, and the food taken was ample, nutritious, and easily
digested, in which the stools, varying from two to three, or twice as
many, daily, were whitish, leaden, or slate-, sometimes
semi-fluid, at other times containing lumps or masses of putty
consistence, presenting to the naked eye a greasy appearance and to the
touch a fatty feel, and at the autopsy has found only thinness and
transparency of the coat of the small intestines and degenerated
mesenteric glands.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is decidedly unfavorable.So far as is known
to the writer, there is but one recorded case of recovery in which the
{1192} diagnosis was indisputable and the fact of a cure was
established by an autopsy.This was the case reported by Carswell,
before referred to.The older and some of the modern authors have
claimed many recoveries, but it must be manifest to every student of
pathological anatomy that the mistaken diagnoses must have been nearly
if not quite as numerous as the cases of cure.The writer has not
witnessed a single case of recovery, but he has observed very many
cured cases of disease which exhibited all the subjective and objective
symptoms of tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands, save and except
those by which its existence can alone be definitely and positively
established.The case of Carswell demonstrates a remote possibility of
cure by the cretaceous metamorphosis of the degenerated glands in a
subject exhibiting the scrofulous diathesis.In view of this isolated
observation, one cannot refuse to accept a similar possibility in cases
in which the disease may be localized and confined to a few of the
glands.In such cases, if recognized previous to the formation of
cheesy foci, the possibility of staying, limiting, and perhaps
occasionally curing, the disease should not be regarded as absolutely
hopeless; yet the opportunities of examining the glands in the first
stage of change has so rarely occurred that no one is authorized to
assert that the hyperplasia is the true picture of the condition in
which those in the advanced stage had its beginning; nor has any one
claimed to have witnessed the progressive stages of resolution taking
place in such glands.The cretaceous transformation is an accepted though remote possibility,
and absorption by means of gradual softening of the cheesy masses is
perhaps a reasonable hypothesis.But even if either of these processes
was an occasional termination of the disease, it could only lessen its
gravity and prolong life, with an incomplete recovery, in those few
cases in which the tuberculous or scrofulous changes were confined to a
less number of glands than was necessary to maintain the nutrition of
the body.For while there is no serious obstacle to the flow of chyle
through the glands in the condition of simple hyperplasia, it is
completely obstructed in those transformed into cheesy masses or
purulent collections.The channels through the glands must sooner or
later be obliterated by the presence of the abundant cell-proliferation
which characterizes the initial stage of change in this disease.For if
the compression is sufficient to cut off the supply of blood, it must
prove equally destructive to the complex system of lymph-paths.To the
impermeability of the glands must the emaciation and exhaustion which
mark the course of the disease, to a greater or less degree according
to the number of glands involved, be due.If the investigations of Schuppel should be verified, and the primary
tubercle-formations be accepted as the initial stage of change, the
prognosis will be less favorable, but a distinct line of demarcation
may be established between two classes of cases in each of which cheesy
transformation may occur, but in one the tubercle-formations may be
primary, and in the other secondary.In the latter class the prognosis
may be more favorable, because treatment may be effective if commenced
prior to the beginning of the retrogressive metamorphosis.COURSE, DURATION, AND COMPLICATIONS.--When tabes is a complication of
pulmonary or bronchial phthisis, or when either of the latter {1193}
diseases appears as an intercurrent affection during the course of a
primary localized tuberculosis of these glands, the glandular
degeneration runs a more rapid course.When it appears as an extension
of external scrofulous affections or finds its cause in
gastro-intestinal irritation, its course is usually less rapid.The
number of glands involved greatly influences its duration.The
mechanical impediment to nutrition offered by a large number of
impermeable glands promotes rapid emaciation and exhaustion.The
condition of the mucous coat of the alimentary tract offers many
considerations that affect its course and duration.Follicular
enteritis hastens, and tuberculous ulceration of the mucous membrane
speedily brings, the case to a fatal termination.Some of the older authors refer to the frequent complication of rickets
with tabes mesenterica, and the writer in numerous post-mortem
examinations of the bodies of children dying of rickets has invariably
found cheesy mesenteric glands.In view of the fact that rickets is
constantly associated with disturbance of the alimentary tract, it
should not be a surprise to find the glands in such close contiguity
to, and having vascular communication with, the diseased mucous surface
in a condition of hyperplasia.Simple hypertrophy is probably a common
complication in cases which terminate by recovery, but there must be
some element of cause, other than inflammation of the mucous membrane
of the intestines, that determines the retrogressive metamorphosis.Several of the older authors have classed rickets in the category of
strumous diseases, and it may be that in the fatal cases tuberculosis
of the mesenteric glands is a local expression of this diathesis.TREATMENT.--The treatment consists, for the most part, in methods of
prevention and palliation.The tendency to disease of the lymphatic
glands in scrofulous children is so constant that it is important to
remove all sources of irritation and to combat all influences likely to
hasten or promote the localization of the constitutional condition.All
chronic discharges and diseases of the skin and mucous membrane, the
continuance of which might produce glandular complications, should be
cured as speedily as possible, slight colds should receive prompt
attention, and catarrhal inflammations of the respiratory organs should
be arrested as quickly as the resources of science will permit.The
alimentary tract demands constant and careful observation.Trivial
disorders should not be neglected: the causes should be ascertained and
removed.Digestion and nutrition should be maintained at a healthy
standard.The hygiene of person, dwelling, and sleeping apartments
merits constant and intelligent supervision.As stated above, tabes of the mesenteric glands is so frequently
secondary to other diseases of a scrofulous nature that the danger lies
in the failure to arrest or cure such affections.It is unfortunately
too true that some of them are often beyond the resources of medical
skill, but in many cases the initial manifestations of the strumous
diathesis are either entirely neglected or inappropriately treated.In
many such cases the final and fatal complication of mesenteric phthisis
could be prevented.The treatment of these affections belongs properly
to the subjects of tuberculosis and scrofula, to be found in other
parts of this System of Medicine.Localized tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands is so often, either
{1194} directly or indirectly, connected with catarrhal inflammations
of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane that the cure of these
affections cannot be too strongly insisted upon as an effective method
of prevention.This is especially true with children exhibiting the
physical signs of the strumous diathesis.When it is inherited from a
diseased mother, it may be necessary to resort to artificial feeding
before the proper time for weaning has been reached.In such cases no
uniform rule can be arbitrarily followed.The condition of both mother
and child must be considered, and cases will occur which will demand
the exercise of the most cautious discretion and diligent observation.When the disease has become established but little can be accomplished.In such cases the treatment refers to the palliation of symptoms and
the maintenance of nutrition.Pain, when present, must be relieved--if
necessary by anodynes, either given internally or applied in the form
of cataplasms.Most often it is due to the coexisting disease of the
intestinal mucous membrane or to the ingestion of unsuitable foods.The
diet should be regulated and limited to nutritious and easily-digested
articles.Sometimes, even in cases of advanced degeneration of the
glands, great benefit may be temporarily obtained by attention to the
diet.Diarrhoea should be controlled, but when dependent upon
tuberculous ulcerations of the intestinal mucous membrane but little
can be done toward delaying the fatal termination.When a large number
of glands are affected, it will be necessary to limit the diet to such
nutrient fluids as may be absorbed from the stomach.The medical treatment is confined to a few remedies.Faulty nutrition
is the predominant factor, and the drugs employed should be directed to
the improvement of the assimilative functions.The lacto-phosphate of
iron in the form of syrup, or the phosphates in the form of the
compound syrup, sometimes prove valuable tonics.The lacto-phosphate
may be given in combination with cod-liver oil.This latter, either
internally or by inunction, is the most valuable and universally
applicable of all remedies.The mistake is very frequently made of
giving too large quantities.Few children can digest as much as a
drachm administered three times a day.In Washington it is usually
given in the form of the phosphatic emulsion, and has proved in the
service of the Children's Hospital a valuable and effective remedy in
the nutritional disorders of children.Of the chalybeates, the syrup of
the iodide of iron is by far the most valuable; this may be given alone
or in combination with cod-liver oil.It is specially indicated when
anaemia is a marked characteristic.Some recent reports favor the
employment of pancreatized foods.The ointment of the iodide of lead
has been highly extolled as a local application to the belly.The
nature of the disease should be constantly borne in mind, and all
depressing agencies should be sedulously avoided.{1195}

END OF VOLUME II.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A System of Practical Medicine By
American Authors, Vol.It is difficult to make a precise calculation as to the average
expense of every common shell or carcass, actually thrown against the
enemy; but it is generally supposed and admitted, that, on a moderate
estimate, these missiles, one with another, cannot cost government
less than £5 each; nor can this be doubted, when, in addition to the
first cost of the ammunition, that of the _ordnance_, and _the charges
incidental to its application_, are considered.But as to the Rocket
and its apparatus, it has been seen, that the _principal expense_ is
that of the first construction, an expense, which it must be fairly
stated, that the charges of conveyance cannot more than double under
any circumstances; so that where the mode of throwing carcasses by
32-pounder Rockets is adopted, there is, at least, an average saving
of £3 on every carcass so thrown, and proportionally for the larger
natures; especially as not only the conflagrating powers of the
spherical carcass are equalled even by the 32-pounder Rocket, but
greatly exceeded by the larger Rockets; and the more especially indeed,
as the difference of accuracy, for the purposes of bombardment, is not
worthy to be mentioned, since it is no uncommon thing for shells fired
from a mortar at long ranges, to spread to the right and left of each
other, upwards of 500 or even 600 yards, as was lately proved by a
series of experiments, where the mortar bed was actually fixed in the
ground; an aberration which the Rocket will never equal, unless some
accident happens to the stick in firing; and this, I may venture to
say, does not occur oftener than the failure of the fuze in the firing
of shells.The fact is, that whatever aberration does exist in the
Rocket, it is distinctly seen; whereas, in ordinary projectiles it is
scarcely to be traced--and hence has arisen a very exaggerated notion
of the inaccuracy of the former.But to recur to the economy of the Rocket carcass; how much is not the
saving of this system of bombardment enhanced, when considered with
reference to naval bombardment, when the expensive construction of the
large mortar vessel is viewed, together with the charge of their whole
establishment, compared with the few occasions of their use, and their
unfitness for general service?Whereas, by means of the Rocket, every
vessel, nay, every boat, has the power of throwing carcasses without
any alteration in her construction, or any impediment whatever to her
general services.So much for the comparison required as to the application of the Rocket
in bombardment; I shall now proceed to the calculation of the expense
of this ammunition for field service, compared with that of common
artillery ammunition.In the first place, it should be stated that the
Rocket will project every species of shot or shell which can be fired
from field guns, and indeed, even heavier ammunition than is ordinarily
used by artillery in the field.But it will be a fair criterion to make
the calculation, with reference to the six and nine-pounder common
ammunition; these two natures of shot or shell are projected by a small
Rocket, which I have denominated the 12-pounder, and which will give
horizontally, and _without apparatus_, the same range as that of the
gun, and _with apparatus_, considerably more.The calculation may be
stated as follows:--

                                           £._s._  _d._
                      {Case and stick      0    5     6
  12-pounder Rocket   {Rocket composition  0    1    10½
                      {Labour, &c.0    2     0
                                          --------------
                                          £0    9     4½
                                          --------------

But this sum is capable of the following reduction, by substituting
elementary force for manual labour, and by employing bamboo in lieu of
the stick._s._  _d._
                    {Case and stick  0   4     0
  [B]Reduced Price  {Composition     0   1    10½
                    {Driving         0   0     6
                                    -------------
                                    £0   6     4½
                                    -------------

    [B] And this is the sum that, ought to be taken in a general
        calculation of the advantages of which the system is
        _capable_, because to this it _may_ be brought.Now the cost of the shot or spherical case is the same whether
projected from a gun or thrown by the Rocket; and the fixing it to the
Rocket costs about the same as strapping the shot to the wooden bottom.This 6_s._ 4½_d._ therefore is to be set against the value of the
gunpowder, cartridge, &c. required for the gun, which may be estimated
as follows:--

                                                         £._s._  _d._

Taking the average, therefore, of the six and nine-pounder ammunition,
the Rocket ammunition costs 3_s._ 2¾_d._ a round more than the common
ammunition.Now we must compare the simplicity of the use of the Rocket, with the
expensive apparatus of artillery, to see what this trifling difference
of first cost in the Rocket has to weigh against it.In the first
place, we have seen, that in many situations the Rocket requires no
apparatus at all to use it, and that, where it does require any, it
is of the simplest kind: we have seen also, that both infantry and
cavalry can, in a variety of instances, combine this weapon with their
other powers; so that it is not, in such cases, _even to be charged
with the pay of the men_.These, however, are circumstances that can
_in no case_ happen with respect to ordinary artillery ammunition; the
use of which never can be divested of the expense of the construction,
transport, and maintenance of the necessary ordnance to project it,
or of the men _exclusively_ required to work that ordnance.What
proportion, therefore, will the trifling difference of first cost, and
the average facile and unexpensive application of the Rocket bear to
the heavy contingent charges involved in the use of field artillery?It
is a fact, that, in the famous Egyptian campaign, those charges did not
amount to less than £20 per round, one with another, _exclusive_ of the
pay of the men; nor can they for any campaign be put at less than from
£2 to £3 per round.It must be obvious, therefore, although it is not
perhaps practicable actually to clothe the calculation in figures, that
the saving must be very great indeed in favour of the Rocket, in the
field as well as in bombardment.Thus far, however, the calculation is limited merely as to the bare
question of expense; but on the score of general advantage, how is not
the balance augmented in favour of the Rocket, when all the _exclusive_
facilities of its use are taken into the account--the _universality_
of the application, the _unlimited_ quantity of instantaneous fire
to be produced by it for particular occasions--of fire not to be by
any possibility approached in quantity by means of ordnance?Now to
all these points of excellence one only drawback is attempted to be
stated--this is, the difference of accuracy: but the value of the
objection vanishes when fairly considered; for in the first place, it
must be admitted, that the general business of action is not that of
target-firing; and the more especially with a weapon like the Rocket,
which possesses the facility of bringing such quantities of fire on any
point: thus, if the difference of accuracy were as ten to one against
the Rocket, as the facility of using it is at least as ten to one in
its favour, the ratio would be that of equality.The truth is, however,
that the difference of accuracy, for actual application against troops,
instead of ten to one, cannot be stated even as two to one; and,
consequently, the compound ratio as to effect, the same shot or shell
being projected, would be, even with this admission of comparative
inaccuracy, greatly in favour of the Rocket System.But it must still
further be borne in mind, that this system is yet in its infancy, that
much has been accomplished in a short time, and that there is every
reason to believe, that the accuracy of the Rocket may be actually
brought upon a par with that of other artillery ammunition for all the
important purposes of field service.Transcriber’s Notes


Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of
inconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.In the table of Ranges:

  Transcriber rearranged parts of the column headings, but “as
  follow” (singular) in the table’s title was printed that way in
  the original.The column heading “55 to 60°” was misprinted as “55 to 66°”;
  corrected here.Shirley, you've got a fine color--only it's laid on in
spots.""You're spattery, too," she retorted."I must go help lay out the
supper now.""Will anyone want supper, after so many cherries?"Some of the boys brought the table from the house, stretching it out to
its uttermost length.Boyd provided,
and unpacked the boxes stacked on the porch.From the kitchen came an
appetizing odor of hot coffee.Hilary and Bell went off after flowers
for the center of the table."We'll put one at each place, suggestive of the person--like a place
card," Hilary proposed.Boyd and cut her one of these old-fashioned
spice pinks," Hilary said."Better put a bit of pepper-grass for the Imp," Tracy suggested, as the
girls went from place to place up and down the long table."Paul's to have a <DW29>," Hilary insisted.She remembered how, if it
hadn't been for Pauline's "thought" that wet May afternoon, everything
would still be as dull and dreary as it was then.At her own place she found a spray of belated wild roses, Tom had laid
there, the pink of their petals not more delicate than the soft color
coming and going in the girl's face."We've brought for-get-me-not for you, Shirley," Bell said, "so that
you won't forget us when you get back to the city.""Sound the call to supper, sonny!"Tom told Bob, and Bob, raising the
farm dinner-horn, sounded it with a will, making the girls cover their
ears with their hands and bringing the boys up with a rush."It's a beautiful picnic, isn't it?"Patience said, reappearing in time
to slip into place with the rest."And after supper, I will read you the club song," Tracy announced."Read it now, son--while we eat," Tom suggested.Tracy rose promptly--"Mind you save me a few scraps then.First, it
isn't original--"

"All the better," Jack commented."Hush up, and listen--

  "'A cheerful world?--It surely is.And if you understand your biz
    You'll taboo the worry worm,
    And cultivate the happy germ."'It's a habit to be happy,
    Just as much as to be scrappy.So put the frown away awhile,
    And try a little sunny smile.'"Tracy tossed the scrap of
paper across the table to Bell."Put it to music, before the next
round-up, if you please.""We've got a club song and a club badge, and we ought to have a club
motto," Josie said."It's right to your hand, in your song," her brother answered."'It's
a habit to be happy.'"Pauline seconded him, and the motto was at once adopted.CHAPTER VIII

SNAP-SHOTS

Bell Ward set the new song to music, a light, catchy tune, easy to pick
up.It took immediately, the boys whistled it, as they came and went,
and the girls hummed it.Patience, with cheerful impartiality, did
both, in season and out of season.It certainly looked as though it were getting to be a habit to be happy
among a good many persons in Winton that summer.The spirit of the new
club seemed in the very atmosphere.A rivalry, keen but generous, sprang up between the club members in the
matter of discovering new ways of "Seeing Winton," or, failing that, of
giving a new touch to the old familiar ones.There were many informal and unexpected outings, besides the club's
regular ones, sometimes amongst all the members, often among two or
three of them.Frequently, Shirley drove over in the surrey, and she and Pauline and
Hilary, with sometimes one of the other girls, would go for long
rambling drives along the quiet country roads, or out beside the lake.Shirley generally brought her sketch-book and there were pleasant
stoppings here and there.And there were few days on which Bedelia and the trap were not out,
Bedelia enjoying the brisk trots about the country quite as much as her
companions.Hilary soon earned the title of "the kodak fiend," Josie declaring she
took pictures in her sleep, and that "Have me; have my camera," was
Hilary's present motto.Certainly, the camera was in evidence at all
the outings, and so far, Hilary had fewer failures to her account than
most beginners.Her "picture diary" she called the big scrap-book in
which was mounted her record of the summer's doings.Those doings were proving both numerous and delightful.Shaw, as
an honorary member, had invited the club to a fishing party, which had
been an immense success.The doctor had followed it by a moonlight
drive along the lake and across on the old sail ferry to the New York
side, keeping strictly within that ten-mile-from-home limit, though
covering considerably more than ten miles in the coming and going.There had been picnics of every description, to all the points of
interest and charm in and about the village; an old-time supper at the
Wards', at which the club members had appeared in old-fashioned
costumes; a strawberry supper on the church lawn, to which all the
church were invited, and which went off rather better than some of the
sociables had in times past.As the Winton _Weekly News_ declared proudly, it was the gayest summer
the village had known in years.Paul Shaw's theory about
developing home resources was proving a sound one in this instance at
least.Hilary had long since forgotten that she had ever been an invalid, had
indeed, sometimes, to be reminded of that fact.She had quite
discarded the little "company" fiction, except now and then, by way of
a joke."I'd rather be one
of the family these days.""That's all very well," Patience retorted, "when you're getting all the
good of being both.Patience had not
found her summer quite as cloudless as some of her elders; being an
honorary member had not meant _all_ of the fun in her case.She wished
very much that it were possible to grow up in a single night, thus
wiping out forever that drawback of being "a little girl."Still, on the whole, she managed to get a fair share of the fun going
on and quite agreed with the editor of the _Weekly News_, going so far
as to tell him so when she met him down street.She had a very kindly
feeling in her heart for the pleasant spoken little editor; had he not
given her her full honors every time she had had the joy of being
"among those present"?There had been three of those checks from Uncle Paul; it was wonderful
how far each had been made to go.It was possible nowadays to send for
a new book, when the reviews were more than especially tempting.There
had also been a tea-table added to the other attractions of the side
porch, not an expensive affair, but the little Japanese cups and
saucers were both pretty and delicate, as was the rest of the service;
while Miranda's cream cookies and sponge cakes were, as Shirley
declared, good enough to be framed.Even the minister appeared now and
then of an afternoon, during tea hour, and the young people, gathered
on the porch, began to find him a very pleasant addition to their
little company, he and they getting acquainted, as they had never
gotten acquainted before.Sextoness Jane came every week now to help with the ironing, which
meant greater freedom in the matter of wash dresses; and also, to
Sextoness Jane herself, the certainty of a day's outing every week.To
Sextoness Jane, those Tuesdays at the parsonage were little short of a
dissipation.Miranda, unbending in the face of such sincere and humble
admiration, was truly gracious.The glimpses the little bent, old
sextoness got of the young folks, the sense of life going on about her,
were as good as a play, to quote her own simile, confided of an evening
to Tobias, her great black cat, the only other inmate of the old
cottage."I reckon Uncle Paul would be rather surprised," Pauline said one
evening, "if he could know all the queer sorts of ways in which we use
his money.But the little easings-up do count for so much.""Indeed they do," Hilary agreed warmly, "though it hasn't all gone for
easings-ups, as you call them, either."She had sat down right in the
middle of getting ready for bed, to revel in her ribbon box; she so
loved pretty ribbons!The committee on finances, as Pauline called her mother, Hilary, and
herself, held frequent meetings."And there's always one thing," the
girl would declare proudly, "the treasury is never entirely empty."She kept faithful account of all money received and spent; each month a
certain amount was laid away for the "rainy day"--which meant, really,
the time when the checks should cease to come---"for, you know, Uncle
Paul only promised them for the _summer_," Pauline reminded the others,
and herself, rather frequently.Nor was all of the remainder ever
quite used up before the coming of the next check."You're quite a business woman, my dear," Mr.Shaw said once, smiling
over the carefully recorded entries in the little account-book she
showed him.She wrote regularly to her uncle; her letters unconsciously growing
more friendly and informal from week to week.They were bright, vivid
letters, more so than Pauline had any idea of.Paul
Shaw felt himself becoming very well acquainted with these young
relatives whom he had never seen, and in whom, as the weeks went by, he
felt himself growing more and more interested.Without realizing it, he got into the habit of looking forward to that
weekly letter; the girl wrote a nice clear hand, there didn't seem to
be any nonsense about her, and she had a way of going right to her
point that was most satisfactory.It seemed sometimes as if he could
see the old white parsonage and ivy-covered church; the broad
tree-shaded lawns; the outdoor parlor, with the young people gathered
about the tea-table; Bedelia, picking her way along the quiet country
roads; the great lake in all its moods; the manor house.Sometimes Pauline would enclose one or two of Hilary's snap-shots of
places, or persons.At one of these, taken the day of the fishing
picnic, and under which Hilary had written "The best catch of the
season," Mr.Somehow he had never
pictured Phil to himself as middle-aged.If anyone had told him, when
the lad was a boy, that the time would come when they would be like
strangers to each other--Mr.Paul Shaw slipped the snap-shot and letter
back into their envelope.It was that afternoon that he spent considerable time over a catalogue
devoted entirely to sporting goods; and it was a fortnight later that
Patience came flying down the garden path to where Pauline and Hilary
were leaning over the fence, paying a morning call to Bedelia, sunning
herself in the back pasture."You'll never guess what's come _this_ time!And Jed says he reckons
he can haul it out this afternoon if you're set on it!And it's
addressed to the 'Misses Shaw,' so that means it's _mine, too_!"Patience dropped on the grass, quite out of breath.The "it" proved to be a row-boat with a double set of oar-locks, a
perfect boat for the lake, strong and safe, but trig and neat of
outline.Hilary named it the "Surprise" at first sight, and Tom was sent for at
once to paint the name in red letters to look well against the white
background and to match the boat's red trimmings.Some of the young people had boats over at
the lake, rather weather-beaten, tubby affairs, Bell declared them,
after the coming of the "Surprise."A general overhauling took place
immediately, the girls adopted simple boating dresses--red and white,
which were their boating colors.A new zest was given to the water
picnics, Bedelia learning to know the lake road very well.August had come before they fairly realized that their summer was more
than well under way.In little more than a month the long vacation
would be over.Tom and Josie were to go to Boston to school; Bell to
Vergennes."There'll never be another summer quite like it!""I can't bear to think of its being over.""It isn't--yet," Pauline answered."Tom's coming," Patience heralded from the gate, and Hilary ran indoors
for hat and camera.Pauline asked, as her sister came
out again."Out by the Cross-roads' Meeting-House," Tom answered."Hilary has
designs on it, I believe.""You'd better come, too, Paul," Hilary urged."It's a glorious morning
for a walk.""I'm going to help mother cut out; perhaps I'll come to meet you with
Bedelia 'long towards noon."_I'm_ not going to be busy this morning," Patience insinuated."Oh, yes you are, young lady," Pauline told her."Mother said you were
to weed the aster bed."Patience looked longingly after the two starting gayly off down the
path, their cameras swung over their shoulders, then she looked
disgustedly at the aster bed.It was quite the biggest of the smaller
beds.--She didn't see what people wanted to plant so many asters for;
she had never cared much for asters, she felt she should care even less
about them in the future.By the time Tom and Hilary reached the old Cross-Roads' Meeting-House
that morning, after a long roundabout ramble, Hilary, for one, was
quite willing to sit down and wait for Pauline and the trap, and eat
the great, juicy blackberries Tom gathered for her from the bushes
along the road.It had rained during the night and the air was crisp and fresh, with a
hint of the coming fall."Summer's surely on the down grade," Tom
said, throwing himself on the bank beside Hilary."So Paul and I were lamenting this morning.I don't suppose it matters
as much to you folks who are going off to school.""Still it means another summer over," Tom said soberly.He was rather
sorry that it was so--there could never be another summer quite so
jolly and carefree."And the breaking up of the club, I suppose?""I don't see why we need call it a break--just a discontinuance, for a
time."There'll be a lot of you left, to keep it going.""Y-yes, but with three, or perhaps more, out, I reckon we'll have to
postpone the next installment until another summer."Tom went off then for more berries, and Hilary sat leaning back against
the trunk of the big tree crowning the top of Meeting-House Hill, her
eyes rather thoughtful.From where she sat, she had a full view of
both roads for some distance and, just beyond, the little hamlet
scattered about the old meeting-house.Before the gate of one of the houses stood a familiar gig, and
presently, as she sat watching, Dr.Brice came down the narrow
flower-bordered path, followed by a woman.At the gate both stopped;
the woman was saying something, her anxious, drawn face seeming out of
keeping with the cheery freshness of the morning and the flowers
nodding their bright heads about her.As the doctor stood listening, his old shabby medicine case in his
hand, with face bent to the troubled one raised to his, and bearing
indicating grave sympathy and understanding, Hilary reached for her
camera."I want it for the book Josie and I are making for you to take away
with you, 'Winton Snap-shots.'Tom looked at the gig, moving slowly off down the road now.He hated
to say so, but he wished Hilary would not put that particular snap-shot
in.He had a foreboding that it was going to make him a bit
uncomfortable--later--when the time for decision came; though, as for
that, he had already decided--beyond thought of change.He wished that
the pater hadn't set his heart on his coming back here to practice--and
he wished, too, that Hilary hadn't taken that photo."It's past twelve," Tom glanced at the sun."Maybe we'd better walk on
a bit."But they had walked a considerable bit, all the way to the parsonage,
in fact, before they saw anything of Pauline.There, she met them at
the gate."Have you seen any trace of Patience--and Bedelia?""They're both missing, and it's pretty safe guessing they're together.""But Patience would never dare--"

"Wouldn't she!""Jim brought Bedelia 'round about
eleven and when I came out a few moments later, she was gone and so was
Patience.We traced them as far as the
Lake road.""I'll go hunt, too," Tom offered."Don't you worry, Paul; she'll turn
up all right--couldn't down the Imp, if you tried.""But she's never driven Bedelia alone; and Bedelia's not Fanny."However, half an hour later, Patience drove calmly into the yard,
Towser on the seat beside her, and if there was something very like
anxiety in her glance, there was distinct triumph in the way she
carried her small, bare head.she announced, smiling pleasantly from
her high seat, at the worried, indignant group on the porch."I tell
you, there isn't any need to 'hi-yi' this horse!""Did you ever hear the beat of that!"Shaw said, and Patience climbed obediently
down.She bore the prompt banishment to her own room which followed,
with seeming indifference.Certainly, it was not unexpected; but when
Hilary brought her dinner up to her presently, she found her sitting on
the floor, her head on the bed.It was only a few days now to
Shirley's turn and it was going to be such a nice turn.Patience felt
that for once Patience Shaw had certainly acted most unwisely.Hilary put the tray on the table and sitting
down on the bed, took the tumbled head on her knee."We've been so
worried!You see, Bedelia isn't like Fanny!""That's why I wanted to get a chance to drive her by myself for once!out on the Lake road I just let her loose!"For
the moment, pride in her recent performance routed all contrition from
Patience's voice--"I tell you, folks I passed just stared!""Patience, how--"

"I wasn't scared the least bit; and, of course, Bedelia knew it.Uncle
Jerry says they always know when you're scared, and if Mr.Allen is the
most up in history of any man in Vermont, Uncle Jerry is the most in
horses."Hilary felt that the conversation was hardly proceeding upon the lines
her mother would have approved of, especially under present
circumstances."That has nothing to do with it, you know, Patience,"
she said, striving to be properly severe.I think it's nice not being scared of
things.You're sort of timid 'bout things, aren't you, Hilary?""It's going to be such a dreadful long
afternoon--all alone.""But I can't stay, mother would not want--"

"Just for a minute.I--coming back,
I met Jane, and I gave her a lift home--and she did love it so--she
says she's never ridden before behind a horse that really went as if it
enjoyed it as much as she did.That was some good out of being bad,
wasn't it?And--I told you--ever'n' ever so long ago, that I was
mighty sure Jane'd just be tickled to death to belong to our club.I
think you might ask her--I don't see why she shouldn't like Seeing
Winton, same's we do--she doesn't ever have fun--and she'll be dead
pretty soon.She's getting along, Jane is--it'd make me mad's anything
to have to die 'fore I'd had any fun to speak of.Jane's really very
good company--when you draw her out--she just needs drawing out--Jane
does.Seems to me, she remembers every funeral and wedding and
everything--that's ever taken place in Winton."Patience stopped,
sheer out of breath, but there was an oddly serious look on her little
eager face.Hilary stroked back the tangled red curls."Maybe you're right, Patty;
maybe we have been selfish with our good times.I'll have to go now,
dear.You--I may tell mother--that you are sorry--truly, Patty?""But I reckon, it's a good deal on account of
Shirley's turn," she explained."You don't suppose you could fix that up with mother?You're pretty
good at fixing things up with mother, Hilary."Hilary laughed, but when she had closed the door, she
opened it again to stick her head in."I'll try, Patty, at any rate,"
she promised.Shaw was busy in the
study and Pauline had gone out on an errand.Hilary went up-stairs
again, going to sit by one of the side windows in the "new room."Over at the church, Sextoness Jane was making ready for the regular
weekly prayer meeting; never a service was held in the church that she
did not set all in order.Through one of the open windows, Hilary
caught sight of the bunch of flowers on the reading-desk.Jane had
brought them with her from home.Presently, the old woman herself came
to the window to shake her dust-cloth, standing there a moment, leaning
a little out, her eyes turned to the parsonage.Pauline was coming up
the path, Shirley and Bell were with her.They were laughing and
talking, the bright young voices making a pleasant break in the quiet
of the garden.It seemed to Hilary, as if she could catch the wistful
look in Jane's faded eyes, a look only half consciously so, as if the
old woman reached out vaguely for something that her own youth had been
without and that only lately she had come to feel the lack of.A quick lump came into the girl's throat.Life had seemed so bright
and full of untried possibilities only that very morning, up there on
Meeting-House Hill, with the wind in one's face; and then had come that
woman, following the doctor down from the path.Life was surely
anything but bright for her this crisp August day--and now here was
Jane.And presently--at the moment it seemed very near indeed to
Hilary--she and Paul and all of them would be old and, perhaps,
unhappy.And then it would be good to remember--that they had tried to
share the fun and laughter of this summer of theirs with others.Hilary thought of the piece of old tapestry hanging on the studio wall
over at the manor--of the interwoven threads--the dark as necessary to
the pattern as the bright.Perhaps they had need of Sextoness Jane, of
the interweaving of her life into theirs--of the interweaving of all
the village lives going on about them--quite as much as those more
sober lives needed the brightening touch of theirs."I'm coming," Hilary answered, and went slowly down to where the others
were waiting on the porch."I've been having a think--and I've come to the conclusion that we're a
selfish, self-absorbed set."Pauline went to the study window, "please come out here.Hilary's calling us names, and that isn't polite.""I hope not very bad names," she said.Hilary swung slowly back and forth in the hammock."I didn't mean it
that way--it's only--"  She told what Patience had said about Jane's
joining the club, and then, rather reluctantly, a little of what she
had been thinking."I think Hilary's right," Shirley declared."Let's form a deputation
and go right over and ask the poor old soul to join here and now.""I would never've thought of it," Bell said."But I don't suppose I've
ever given Jane a thought, anyway.""Patty's mighty cute--for all she's such a terror at times," Pauline
admitted."She knows a lot about the people here--and it's just
because she's interested in them.""Come on," Shirley said, jumping up."We're going to have another
honorary member.""I think it would be kind, girls," Mrs."Jane will
feel herself immensely flattered, and I know of no one who upholds the
honor of Winton more honestly or persistently."Shaw," Shirley coaxed, "when we come back, mayn't
Patience Shaw, H. M., come down and have tea with us?""I hardly think--"

"Please, Mother Shaw," Hilary broke in; "after all--she started this,
you know.That sort of counterbalances the other, doesn't it?""Well, we'll see," her mother laughed.Pauline ran to get one of the extra badges with which Shirley had
provided her, and then the four girls went across to the church.Sextoness Jane was just locking the back door--not the least important
part of the afternoon's duties with her--as they came through the
opening in the hedge."Good afternoon," she said cheerily, "was you
wanting to go inside?""No," Pauline answered, "we came over to invite you to join our club.We thought, maybe, you'd like to?""And wear one of
them blue-ribbon affairs?""See, here it is," and she pointed to
the one in Pauline's hand.Sextoness Jane came down the steps."Me, I ain't never wore a badge!Oncet, when I was a little youngster,'most
like Patience, teacher, she got up some sort of May doings.We was all
to wear white dresses and red, white and blue ribbons--very night
before, I come down with the mumps.Looks like I always come down when
I ought to've stayed up!""But you won't come down with anything this time," Pauline pinned the
blue badge on the waist of Jane's black and white calico."Now you're
an honorary member of 'The S. W. F.She was still stroking it softly as she walked slowly away towards
home.CHAPTER IX

AT THE MANOR

  "'All the names I know from nurse:
    Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse,
    Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock,
    And the Lady Hollyhock,'"

Patience chanted, moving slowly about the parsonage garden, hands full
of flowers, and the big basket, lying on the grass beyond, almost full.Behind her, now running at full speed, now stopping suddenly, back
lifted, tail erect, came Lucky, the black kitten from The Maples.Lucky had been an inmate of the parsonage for some weeks now and was
thriving famously in her adopted home.Towser tolerated her with the
indifference due such a small, insignificant creature, and she
alternately bullied and patronized Towser."We haven't shepherd's purse, nor lady's smock, that I know of, Lucky,"
Patience said, glancing back at the kitten, at that moment threatening
battle at a polite nodding Sweet William, "but you can see for yourself
that we have hollyhocks, while as for bachelor's buttons!Just look at
that big, blue bunch in one corner of the basket."It was the morning of the day of Shirley's turn and Pauline was
hurrying to get ready to go over and help decorate the manor.She was
singing, too; from the open windows of the "new room" came the words--

  "'A cheerful world?--It surely is
    And if you understand your biz
    You'll taboo the worry worm,
    And cultivate the happy germ.'"To which piece of good advice, Patience promptly whistled back the gay
refrain.On the back porch, Sextoness Jane--called in for an extra half-day--was
ironing the white dresses to be worn that afternoon.And presently,
Patience, her basket quite full and stowed away in the trap waiting
before the side door, strolled around to interview her."Well, I was sort of calculating
on going over for a bit; Miss Shirley having laid particular stress on
my coming and this being the first reg'lar doings since I joined the
club.I told her and Pauline they mustn't look for me to go junketing
'round with them all the while, seeing I'm in office--so to speak--and
my time pretty well taken up with my work."I--"  Patience edged nearer the porch.Behind Jane stood the tall
clothes-horse, with its burden of freshly ironed white things.At
sight of a short, white frock, very crisp and immaculate, the blood
rushed to the child's face, then as quickly receded.--After all, it
would have had to be ironed for Sunday and--well, mother certainly had
been very non-committal the past few days--ever since that escapade
with Bedelia, in fact--regarding her youngest daughter's hopes and
fears for this all-important afternoon.And Patience had been wise
enough not to press the matter."But, oh, I do wonder if Hilary has--"  Patience went back to the side
porch.Hilary was there talking to Bedelia."You--you have fixed it
up?"Patience repressed a sudden desire to stamp her foot, and Hilary,
seeing the real doubt and longing in her face, relented."Mother wants
to see you, Patty.From the doorway, she looked back--"I just knew
you wouldn't go back on me, Hilary!I'll love you forever'n' ever."Pauline came out a moment later, drawing on her driving gloves."I
feel like a story-book girl, going driving this time in the morning, in
a trap like this.I wish you were coming, too, Hilary.""Oh, I'm like the delicate story-book girl, who has to rest, so as to
be ready for the dissipations that are to come later.I look the part,
don't I?"Pauline looked down into the laughing, sun-browned face."If Uncle
Paul were to see you now, he might find it hard to believe I
hadn't--exaggerated that time.""Well, it's your fault--and his, or was, in the beginning.You've a
fine basket of flowers to take; Patience has done herself proud this
morning.""It's wonderful how well that young lady can behave--at times."When I hear mother tell how like her you used to
be, I don't feel too discouraged about Patty.""That strikes me as rather a double-edged sort of speech," Pauline
gathered up the reins."Good-by, and don't get too tired."Shirley's turn was to be a combination studio tea and lawn-party, to
which all club members, both regular and honorary, not to mention their
relatives and friends, had been bidden.Following this, was to be a
high tea for the regular members."That's Senior's share," Shirley had explained to Pauline."He insists
that it's up to him to do something."Dayre was on very good terms with the "S. W. F.As for
Shirley, after the first, no one had ever thought of her as an outsider.It was hard now, Pauline thought, as she drove briskly along, the lake
breeze in her face, and the sound of Bedelia's quick trotting forming a
pleasant accompaniment to her, thoughts, very hard, to realize how soon
the summer would be over.But perhaps--as Hilary said--next summer
would mean the taking up again of this year's good times and
interests,--Shirley talked of coming back.As for the winter--Pauline
had in mind several plans for the winter.Those of the club members to
stay behind must get together some day and talk them over.One thing
was certain, the club motto must be lived up to bravely.If not in one
way, why in another.There must be no slipping back into the old
dreary rut and routine.It lay with themselves as to what their winter
should be."And there's fine sleighing here, Bedelia," she said."We'll get the
old cutter out and give it a coat of paint."Bedelia tossed her head, as if she heard in imagination the gay
jingling of the sleighbells."But, in the meantime, here is the manor," Pauline laughed, "and it's
the prettiest August day that ever was, and lawn-parties and such
festivities are afoot, not sleighing parties."The manor stood facing the lake with its back to the road, a broad
sloping lawn surrounded it on three sides, with the garden at the back.For so many seasons, it had stood lonely and neglected, that Pauline
never came near it now, without rejoicing afresh in its altered aspect.Even the sight of Betsy Todd's dish towels, drying on the currant
bushes at one side of the back door, added their touch to the sense of
pleasant, homely life that seemed to envelop the old house nowadays.Shirley came to the gate, as Pauline drew up, Phil, Pat and Pudgey in
close attention."I have to keep an eye on them," she told Pauline."They've just had their baths, and they're simply wild to get out in
the middle of the road and roll.I've told them no self-respecting dog
would wish to come to a lawn-party in anything but the freshest of
white coats, but I'm afraid they're not very self-respecting.""Patience is sure Towser's heart is heavy because he is not to come;
she has promised him a lawn-party on his own account, and that no
grown-ups shall be invited.She's sent you the promised flowers, and
hinted--more or less plainly--that she would have been quite willing to
deliver them in person."Oh, but I'm afraid you've robbed yourself!""The boys have been putting
the awning up."Dayre's fellow artists, who had come up a
day or two before, on a visit to the manor.One of them, at any rate,
deserved Shirley's title."Looks pretty nice,
doesn't it?"he said, with a wave of the hand towards the red and white
striped awning, placed at the further edge of the lawn.Shirley smiled her approval, and introduced him to Pauline, adding that
Miss Shaw was the real founder of their club."It's a might jolly sort of club, too," young Oram said."That is exactly what it has turned out to be," Pauline laughed."Are
the vases ready, Shirley?"Shirley brought the tray of empty flower vases out on the veranda, and
sent Harry Oram for a bucket of fresh water."Harry is to make the
salad," she explained to Pauline, as he came back."Before he leaves
the manor he will have developed into a fairly useful member of
society.""You've never eaten one of my salads, Miss Shaw," Harry said."When
you have, you'll think all your previous life an empty dream.""It's much more likely her later life will prove a nightmare,--for a
while, at least," Shirley declared."Still, Paul, Harry does make them
rather well.Betsy Todd, I am sorry to say, doesn't approve of him.But there are so many persons and things she doesn't approve of;
lawn-parties among the latter."Pauline nodded sympathetically; she knew Betsy Todd of old.Her wonder
was, that the Dayres had been able to put up with her so long, and she
said so."'Hobson's choice,'" Shirley answered, with a little shrug."She isn't
much like our old Therese at home, is she, Harry?But nothing would
tempt Therese away from her beloved New York.Nevaire have
I heard of zat place!'she told Harry, when he interviewed her for us.Senior's gone to Vergennes--on business thoughts intent, or I hope they
are.He's under strict orders not to 'discover a single bit' along the
way, and to get back as quickly as possible.""You see how beautifully she has us all in training?"Suddenly she looked up from her flowers with sobered
face."I wonder," she said slowly, "if you know what it's meant to
us--you're being here this summer, Shirley?Sometimes things do fit in
just right after all.It's helped out wonderfully this summer, having
you here and the manor open.""Pauline has a fairy-story uncle down in New York," Shirley turned to
Harry.I've met him, once or twice--he didn't strike me as
much of a believer in fairy tales.""He's made us believe in them," Pauline answered."I think Senior might have provided me with such a delightful sort of
uncle," Shirley observed."I told him so, but he says, while he's
awfully sorry I didn't mention it before, he's afraid it's too late
now.""Uncle Paul sent us Bedelia," Pauline told the rather perplexed-looking
Harry, "and the row-boat and the camera and--oh, other things.""Because he wanted them to have a nice, jolly summer," Shirley
explained."Pauline's sister had been sick and needed brightening up.""You don't think he's looking around for a nephew to adopt, do you?""A well-intentioned, intelligent young man--with no
end of talent.""For making salads," Shirley added with a sly smile."Oh, well, you know," Harry remarked casually, "these are what Senior
calls my'salad days.'"Whereupon Shirley rose without a word, carrying off her vases of
flowers.The party at the manor was, like all the club affairs, a decided
success.Never had the old place looked so gay and animated, since
those far-off days of its early glory.The young people coming and going--the girls in their light dresses and
bright ribbons made a pleasant place of the lawn, with its background
of shining water.The tennis court, at one side of the house, was one
of the favorite gathering spots; there were one or two boats out on the
lake.The pleasant informality of the whole affair proved its greatest
charm.Allen was there, pointing out to his host the supposed end of the
subterranean passage said to connect the point on which the manor stood
with the old ruined French fort over on the New York side.The
minister was having a quiet chat with the doctor, who had made a
special point of being there.Mothers of club members were exchanging
notes and congratulating each other on the good comradeship and general
air of contentment among the young people.Sextoness Jane was there,
in all the glory of her best dress--one of Mrs.Shaw's handed-down
summer ones--and with any amount of items picked up to carry home to
Tobias, who was certain to expect a full account of this most unusual
dissipation on his mistress's part.Even Betsy Todd condescended to
put on her black woolen--usually reserved for church and funerals--and
walk about among the other guests; but always, with an air that told
plainly how little she approved of such goings on.The Boyds were
there, their badges in full evidence.And last, though far from least,
in her own estimation, Patience was there, very crisp and white and on
her best behavior,--for, setting aside those conditions mother had seen
fit to burden her with, was the delightful fact that Shirley had asked
her to help serve tea.The principal tea-table was in the studio, though there was a second
one, presided over by Pauline and Bell, out under the awning at the
edge of the lawn.Patience thought the studio the very nicest room she had ever been in.It was long and low--in reality, the old dancing-hall, for the manor
had been built after the pattern of its first owner's English home; and
in the deep, recessed windows, facing the lake, many a bepatched and
powdered little belle of Colonial days had coquetted across her fan
with her bravely-clad partner.Dayre had thrown out an extra window at one end, at right angles to
the great stone fireplace, banked to-day with golden rod, thereby
securing the desired north light.On the easel, stood a nearly finished painting,--a sunny corner of the
old manor kitchen, with Betsy Todd in lilac print gown, peeling apples
by the open window, through which one caught a glimpse of the tall
hollyhocks in the garden beyond.Before this portrait, Patience found Sextoness Jane standing in mute
astonishment."Betsy looks like she was just going to say--'take your hands out of
the dish!'Betsy had once helped out
at the parsonage, during a brief illness of Miranda's, and the young
lady knew whereof she spoke."I'd never've thought," Jane said slowly, "that anyone'd get that fond
of Sister Todd--as to want a picture of her!""Oh, it's because she's such a character, you know," Patience explained
serenely.Jane was so good about letting one explain things."'A
perfect character,' I heard one of those artist men say so.""Not what I'd call a 'perfect'
character--not that I've got anything against Sister Todd; but she's
too fond of finding out a body's faults."Patience went off then in search of empty tea-cups.She was having a
beautiful time; at present only one cloud overshadowed her horizon.Already some tiresome folks were beginning to think about going.There
was the talk of chores to be done, suppers to get, and with the
breaking up, must come an end to her share in the party.For mother,
though approached in the most delicate fashion, had proved obdurate
regarding the further festivity to follow.Had mother been willing to
consider the matter, Patience would have cheerfully undertaken to
procure the necessary invitation.Shirley was a very obliging girl."And really, my dears," she said, addressing the three P's
collectively, "it does seem a pity to have to go home before the fun's
all over.And I could manage it--Bob would take me out rowing--if I
coaxed--he rows very slowly.I don't suppose, for one moment, that we
would get back in time.I believe--"  For fully three minutes,
Patience sat quite still in one of the studio window seats, oblivious
of the chatter going on all about her; then into her blue eyes came a
look not seen there very often--"No," she said sternly, shaking her
head at Phil, much to his surprise, for he wasn't doing anything."No--it wouldn't be _square_--and there would be the most awful to-do
afterwards."Shaw called to her to come, that
father was waiting, Patience responded with a very good grace.Dayre caught the wistful look in the child's face."Bless me," he said
heartily."You're not going to take Patience home with you, Mrs.Let her stay for the tea--the young people won't keep late hours, I
assure you.""Sometimes, I find it quite as well not to think things over," Mr."Why, dear me, I'd quite counted on Patience's being
here.You see, I'm not a regular member, either; and I want someone to
keep me in countenance."So presently, Hilary felt a hand slipped eagerly into hers."And oh, I
just love Mr.Then Patience went back to her window seat to play the delightful game
of "making believe" she hadn't stayed.She imagined that instead, she
was sitting between father and mother in the gig, bubbling over with
the desire to "hi-yi" at Fanny, picking her slow way along.The studio was empty, even the dogs were outside, speeding the parting
guests with more zeal than discretion.But after awhile Harry Oram
strolled in."You're an
artist, too, aren't you?""So kind of you to say so," Harry murmured."I have heard grave doubts
expressed on the subject by my too impartial friends.""I mean to be one when I grow up," Patience told him, "so's I can have
a room like this--with just rugs on the floor; rugs slide so
nicely--and window seats and things all cluttery.""May I come and have tea with you?"It'll be really tea--not pretend kind," Patience said."But I'll have
that sort for any children who may come.Hilary takes pictures--she
doesn't make them though.Harry glanced through the open doorway, to where
Hilary sat resting.She was "making" a picture now, he thought to
himself, in her white dress, under the big tree, her pretty hair
forming a frame about her thoughtful face.Taking a portfolio from a
table near by, he went out to where Hilary sat."Your small sister says you take pictures," he said, drawing a chair up
beside hers, "so I thought perhaps you'd let me show you these--they
were taken by a friend of mine.""Oh, but mine aren't anything like these!Hilary bent over the photographs he handed her; marveling over their
soft tones.They were mostly bits of landscape, with here and there a
water view and one or two fleecy cloud effects.It hardly seemed as
though they could be really photographs."I wish I
could--there are some beautiful views about here that would make
charming pictures.""She didn't in the beginning," Harry said, "She's lame; it was an
accident, but she can never be quite well again, so she took this up,
as an amusement at first, but now it's going to be her profession.""And you really think--anyone
could learn to do it?""No, not anyone; but I don't see why the right sort of person couldn't.""I wonder--if I could develop into the right sort.""May I come and see what you have done--and talk it over?""Since this friend of mine took it up, I'm ever so interested in camera
work."She had never thought of her camera
holding such possibilities within it, of its growing into something
better and more satisfying than a mere playmate of the moment.Supper was served on the lawn; the pleasantest, most informal, of
affairs, the presence of the older members of the party serving to turn
the gay give and take of the young folks into deeper and wider
channels, and Shirley's frequent though involuntary--"Do you remember,
Senior?"calling out more than one vivid bit of travel, of description
of places, known to most of them only through books.Later, down on the lower end of the lawn, with the moon making a path
of silver along the water, and the soft hush of the summer night over
everything, Shirley brought out her guitar, singing for them strange
folk-songs, picked up in her rambles with her father.Afterwards, the
whole party sang songs that they all knew, ending up at last with the
club song."'It's a habit to be happy,'" the fresh young voices chorused, sending
the tune far out across the lake; and presently, from a boat on its
further side, it was whistled back to them.Edna said,

"Give it up," Tom answered."Someone who's heard it--there've been
plenty of opportunities for folks to hear it.""Well it isn't a bad gospel to scatter broadcast," Bob remarked."And maybe it's someone who doesn't live about here, and he will go
away taking our tune with him, for other people to catch up," Hilary
suggested."But if he only has the tune and not the words," Josie objected, "what
use will that be?""The spirit of the words is in the tune," Pauline said."No one could
whistle or sing it and stay grumpy.""They'd have to 'put the frown away awhile, and try a little sunny
smile,' wouldn't they?"Patience had been a model of behavior all the evening.Mother would be
sure to ask if she had been good, when they got home.That was one of
those aggravating questions that only time could relieve her from.No
one ever asked Paul, or Hilary, that--when they'd been anywhere.Dayre had promised, the party broke up early, going off in the
various rigs they had come in.Tom and Josie went in the trap with the
Shaws."It's been perfectly lovely--all of it," Josie said, looking
back along the road they were leaving."Every good time we have seems
the best one yet.""You wait 'til my turn comes," Pauline told her."I've such a scheme
in my head."She was in front, between Tom, who was
driving, and Hilary, then she leaned forward, they were nearly home,
and the lights of the parsonage showed through the trees."There's a
light in the parlor--there's company!""And one up in our old room, Hilary.Goodness,
it must be a visiting minister!I didn't know father was expecting
anyone.""I just bet it
isn't any visiting minister--but a visiting--uncle!I feel it in my
bones, as Miranda says.""I feel it in my bones," Patience repeated."I just _knew_ Uncle Paul
would come up--a story-book uncle would be sure to.""Well, here we are," Tom laughed."You'll know for certain pretty
quick."CHAPTER X

THE END OF SUMMER

It was Uncle Paul, and perhaps no one
was more surprised at his unexpected coming,
than he himself.That snap-shot of Hilary's had considerable
to do with it; bringing home to him the
sudden realization of the passing of the years.For the first time, he had allowed himself to
face the fact that it was some time now since
he had crossed the summit of the hill, and that
under present conditions, his old age promised
to be a lonely, cheerless affair.He had never had much to do with young
people; but, all at once, it seemed to him that
it might prove worth his while to cultivate
the closer acquaintance of these nieces of his.Pauline, in particular, struck him as likely to
improve upon a nearer acquaintance.And
that afternoon, as he rode up Broadway, he
found himself wondering how she would
enjoy the ride; and all the sights and wonders
of the great city.Later, over his solitary dinner, he suddenly
decided to run up to Winton the next day.He would not wire them, he would rather like
to take Phil by surprise.So he had arrived at the parsonage,
driving up in Jed's solitary hack, and much plied
with information, general and personal, on the
way, just as the minister and his wife reached
home from the manor.Doesn't father look
tickled to death!"Patience declared, coming
in to her sisters' room that night, ostensibly
to have an obstinate knot untied, but inwardly
determined to make a third at the usual
bedtime talk for that once, at least.It wasn't
often they all came up together."He looks mighty glad," Pauline said."And isn't it funny, bearing him called
Phil?"Patience curled herself up in the
cozy corner."I never've thought of father
as Phil."Hilary paused in the braiding of her long
hair."I'm glad we've got to know him--Uncle
Paul, I mean--through his letters, and
all the lovely things he's done for us; else, I
think I'd have been very much afraid of him.""So am I," Pauline assented.Oram meant--he doesn't look as if
he believed much in fairy stories.But I like
his looks--he's so nice and tall and straight.""He used to have red hair, before it turned
gray," Hilary said, "so that must be a family
trait; your chin's like his, Paul, too,--so
square and determined.""You cut to bed, youngster," Pauline
commanded."You're losing all your beauty
sleep; and really, you know--"

Patience went to stand before the mirror."Maybe I ain't--pretty--yet; but I'm going
to be--some day.Dayre says he likes
red hair, I asked him.He says for me not to
worry; I'll have them all sitting up and taking notice yet."At which Pauline bore promptly down
upon her, escorting her in person to the door
of her own room."And you'd better get to
bed pretty quickly, too, Hilary," she advised,
coming back."You've had enough excitement for one day."Paul Shaw stayed a week; it was a
busy week for the parsonage folk and for
some other people besides.Before it was
over, the story-book uncle had come to know
his nieces and Winton fairly thoroughly;
while they, on their side, had grown very well
acquainted with the tall, rather silent man,
who had a fashion of suggesting the most
delightful things to do in the most matter-of-fact manner.There were one or two trips decidedly
outside that ten-mile limit, including an all day
sail up the lake, stopping for the night at a
hotel on the New York shore and returning
by the next day's boat.There was a visit to
Vergennes, which took in a round of the shops,
a concert, and another night away from home.Hilary
sighed blissfully one morning, as she and her
uncle waited on the porch for Bedelia and
the trap.Hilary was to drive him over to
The Maples for dinner."Or such a summer altogether," Pauline
added, from just inside the study window."I should think it has; we ought to be
eternally grateful to you for making us find
them out," Pauline declared.Shaw smiled, more as if to himself."I
daresay they're not all exhausted yet.""Perhaps," Hilary said slowly, "some
places are like some people, the longer and
better you know them, the more you keep
finding out in them to like.""Father says," Pauline suggested, "that one
finds, as a rule, what one is looking for.""Here we are," her uncle exclaimed, as
Patience appeared, driving Bedelia."Do you
know," he said, as he and Hilary turned out
into the wide village street, "I haven't seen the
schoolhouse yet?"It isn't
much of a building," Hilary answered."It is said to be a very good school for the
size of the place."Hilary turned Bedelia
up the little by-road, leading to the old
weather-beaten schoolhouse, standing back
from the road in an open space of bare ground.I would've been this June, if I
hadn't broken down last winter.""You will be able to go on this fall?"He says, if all his patients got on so
well, by not following his advice, he'd have
to shut up shop, but that, fortunately for
him, they haven't all got a wise uncle down in
New York, to offer counter-advice."Shaw remarked,
adding, "and Pauline considers herself through school?"I know she would like
to go on--but we've no higher school here and--She
read last winter, quite a little, with
father."Supposing you both had an opportunity--for
it must be both, or neither, I judge--and
the powers that be consented--how about
going away to school this winter?"she
cried, "you mean--"

"I have a trick of meaning what I say," her
uncle said, smiling at her."I wish I could say--what I want to--and
can't find words for--" Hilary said."We haven't consulted the higher authorities
yet, you know.""And--Oh, I don't see how mother could
get on without us, even if--"

"Mothers have a knack at getting along
without a good many things--when it means
helping their young folks on a bit,"
Mr."I'll have a talk with her
and your father to-night."That evening, pacing up and down the
front veranda with his brother, Mr.Shaw
said, with his customary abruptness, "You
seem to have fitted in here, Phil,--perhaps, you
were in the right of it, after all.I take it
you haven't had such a hard time, in some ways."Looking back nearly twenty years, he told
himself, that he did not regret that early
choice of his.He had fitted into the life here;
he and his people had grown together.It had
not always been smooth sailing and more than
once, especially the past year or so, his
narrow means had pressed him sorely, but on the
whole, he had found his lines cast in a
pleasant place, and was not disposed to rebel
against his heritage."Yes," he said, at last, "I have fitted in;
too easily, perhaps."Except in the accumulating of books," his
brother suggested."I have not been
able to give unlimited rein even to that mild
ambition.Fortunately, the rarer the
opportunity, the greater the pleasure it brings
with it--and the old books never lose their charm."Paul Shaw flicked the ashes from his
cigar."And the girls--you expect them to
fit in, too?"A note the elder
brother knew of old sounded in the younger
man's voice."Don't mount your high horse just yet,
Phil," he said."I'm not going to rub you up
the wrong way--at least, I don't mean to; but
you were always an uncommonly hard chap to
handle--in some matters.I grant you, it is
their home and not a had sort of home for a
girl to grow up in."Shaw stood for a
moment at the head of the steps, looking off
down the peaceful, shadowy street.It had
been a pleasant week; he had enjoyed it
wonderfully.Already the city
was calling to him; he was homesick for its
rush and bustle, the sense of life and movement."You and I stand as far apart to-day, in
some matters, Phil, as we did twenty--thirty
years ago," he said presently, "and that eldest
daughter of yours--I'm a fair hand at reading
character or I shouldn't be where I am to-day,
if I were not--is more like me than you.""So I have come to think--lately.""That second girl takes after you; she
would never have written that letter to me
last May.""No, Hilary would not have at the time--"

"Oh, I can guess how you felt about it at
the time.But, look here, Phil, you've got
over that--surely?After all, I like to think
now that Pauline only hurried on the
inevitable."Paul Shaw laid his hand on the
minister's shoulder."Nearly twenty years is
a pretty big piece out of a lifetime.I see now
how much I have been losing all these years.""It has been a long time, Paul; and,
perhaps, I have been to blame in not trying more
persistently to heal the breach between us.I
assure you that I have regretted it daily.""You always did have a lot more pride in
your make-up than a man of your profession
has any right to allow himself, Phil.But if
you like, I'm prepared to point out to you
right now how you can make it up to me.Here comes Lady Shaw and we won't
waste time getting to business."That night, as Pauline and Hilary were in
their own room, busily discussing, for by no
means the first time that day, what Uncle Paul
had said to Hilary that morning, and just
how he had looked, when he said it, and was
it at all possible that father would consent,
and so on, _ad libitum_, their mother tapped at the door."That is how you take it," Mrs.She was glad, very glad, that this
unforeseen opportunity should be given her
daughters; and yet--it meant the first break
in the home circle, the first leaving home for them."I'll try and run up for a day or two, before
the girls go to school," he promised his
sister-in-law."Let me know, as soon as you have
decided _where_ to send them."Patience was divided in her opinion, as to
this new plan.It would be lonesome without
Paul and Hilary; but then, for the time
being, she would be, to all intents and purposes,
"Miss Shaw."Also, Bedelia was not going
to boarding-school--on the whole, the
arrangement had its advantages.Of course,
later, she would have her turn at school--Patience
meant to devote a good deal of her
winter's reading to boarding-school stories.She told Sextoness Jane so, when that
person appeared, just before supper time."A lot of things
keep happening to you folks right along," she
observed."Nothing's ever happened to me,
'cept mumps--and things of that sort; you
wouldn't call them interesting."They're 'round on the porch, looking at
some photos Mr.Oram's brought over; and
he's looking at Hilary's.Hilary's going in
for some other kind of picture taking.I wish
she'd leave her camera home, when she goes to
school.Do you want to speak to them about
anything particular?""I'll wait a bit," Jane sat down on the
garden-bench beside Patience.the latter said, as the
front gate clicked a few moments later.she called, "You're wanted, Paul!""You and Hilary going to be busy
tonight?"Jane asked, as Pauline came across
the lawn."Well," Jane said, "it ain't prayer-meeting
night, and it ain't young peoples' night and it
ain't choir practice night, so I thought maybe
you'd like me to take my turn at showing you
something.Not all the club--like's not they
wouldn't care for it, but if you think they
would, why, you can show it to them sometime.""So can I--if you tell mother you want me
to," Patience put in."A good two miles--we'd best walk--we
can rest after we get there.Maybe, if you
like, you'd better ask Tom and Josie.Your
ma'll be better satisfied if he goes along, I
reckon.I'll come for you at about half-past
seven.""All right, thank you ever so much," Pauline
said, and went to tell Hilary, closely
pursued by Patience.Shaw
vetoed Pauline's proposition that Patience
should make one of the party."Not every time, my dear," she explained.Promptly at half-past seven Jane
appeared.she said, as the four
young people came to meet her."You don't
want to go expecting anything out of the
common.Like's not, you've all seen it a heap
of times, but maybe not to take particular
notice of it."She led the way through the garden to the
lane running past her cottage, where Tobias
sat in solitary dignity on the doorstep, down
the lane to where it merged in to what was
nothing more than a field path."But not out on the water," Josie said."You're taking us too far below the pier for that.""It'll be on the water--what
you're going to see," she was getting
a good deal of pleasure out of her small
mystery, and when they reached the low shore,
fringed with the tall sea-grass, she took her
party a few steps along it to where an old log
lay a little back from the water."I reckon
we'll have to wait a bit," she said, "but it'll
be 'long directly."They sat down in a row, the young people
rather mystified.Apparently the broad
expanse of almost motionless water was quite
deserted.There was a light breeze blowing
and the soft swishing of the tiny waves against
the bank was the only sound to break the
stillness; the sky above the long irregular range
of mountains on the New York side, still wore
its sunset colors, the lake below sending hack
a faint reflection of them.But presently these faded until only the
afterglow was left, to merge in turn into the
soft summer twilight, through which the stars
began to glimpse, one by one.The little group had been mostly silent,
each busy with his or her thoughts; so far as
the young people were concerned, happy
thoughts enough; for if the closing of each
day brought their summer nearer to its
ending, the fall would bring with it new
experiences, an entering of new scenes.Sextoness Jane broke the silence,
pointing up the lake, to where a tiny point of
red showed like a low-hung star through the
gathering darkness.Moment by moment,
other lights came into view, silently, steadily,
until it seemed like some long, gliding
sea-serpent, creeping down towards them through
the night.They had all seen it, times without number,
before.The long line of canal boats being
towed down the lake to the canal below; the
red lanterns at either end of each boat
showing as they came.But to-night, infected
perhaps, by the pride, the evident delight, in
Jane's voice, the old familiar sight held them
with the new interest the past months had
brought to bear upon so many old, familiar things."It is--wonderful," Pauline said at last."It might be a scene from--fairyland, almost.""Me--I love to see them come stealing long
like that through the dark," Jane said slowly
and a little hesitatingly.It was odd to be
telling confidences to anyone except Tobias."I don't know where they come from, nor
where they're a-going to.Many's the night
I walk over here just on the chance of seeing
one.Mostly, this time of year, you're pretty
likely to catch one.When I was younger, I
used to sit and fancy myself going aboard on
one of them and setting off for strange parts.I wasn't looking to settle down here in Winton
all my days; but I reckon, maybe, it's just's
well--anyhow, when I got the freedom to
travel, I'd got out of the notion of it--and
perhaps, there's no telling, I might have been
terribly disappointed.And there ain't any
hindrance 'gainst my setting off--in my own
mind--every time I sits here and watches a
tow go down the lake.I've seen a heap of
big churches in my travels--it's mostly easier
'magining about them--churches are pretty
much alike I reckon, though I ain't seen many, I'll admit."No one answered for a moment, but Jane,
used to Tobias for a listener, did not mind.Then in the darkness, Hilary laid a hand
softly over the work-worn ones clasped on
Jane's lap.It was hard to imagine Jane
young and full of youthful fancies and
longings; yet years ago there had been a Jane--not
Sextoness Jane then--who had found
Winton dull and dreary and had longed to get
away.But for her, there had been no one to
wave the magic wand, that should transform
the little Vermont village into a place filled
with new and unexplored charms.Never in
all Jane's many summers, had she known one
like this summer of theirs; and for them--the
wonder was by no means over--the years
ahead were bright with untold possibilities.Hilary sighed for very happiness, wondering
if she were the same girl who had rocked
listlessly in the hammock that June morning,
protesting that she didn't care for "half-way" things."I'm ever so glad we came, thank you so
much, Jane," Pauline said heartily."I wonder what'll have happened by the
time we all see our next tow go down," Josie
said, as they started towards home."We may see a good many more than one
before the general exodus," her brother answered."But we won't have time to come watch for
them.Oh, Paul, just think, only a little
while now--"

Tom slipped into step with Hilary, a little
behind the others."I never supposed the old
soul had it in her," he said, glancing to where
Jane trudged heavily on ahead."Still, I
suppose she was young--once; though I've never
thought of her being so before.""I wonder,--maybe,
she's been better off, after all, right, here at
home.She wouldn't have got to be
Sextoness Jane anywhere else, probably.""Is there a
hidden meaning--subject to be carefully avoided?""So you and Paul are off on your travels, too?""Yes, though I can hardly believe it yet.""And just as glad to go as any of us.""Oh, but we're coming back--after we've
been taught all manner of necessary things.""Edna'll be the only one of you girls left
behind; it's rough on her.""It certainly is; we'll all have to write her
heaps of letters.""Much time there'll be for letter-writing,
outside of the home ones," Tom said."Speaking of time," Josie turned towards
them, "we're going to be busier than any bee
ever dreamed of being, before or since Dr.They certainly were busy days that
followed.So many of the young folks were
going off that fall that a good many of the
meetings of "The S. W. F. Club" resolved
themselves into sewing-bees, for the girl members only."If we'd known how jolly they were, we'd
have tried them before," Bell declared one
morning, dropping down on the rug Pauline
had spread under the trees at one end of the
parsonage lawn.Patience, pulling bastings with a business-like
air, nodded her curly head wisely."Miranda says,
folks mostly get 'round to enjoying
their blessings 'bout the time they come to lose them.""Has the all-important question been
settled yet, Paul?"Edna asked, looking up from
her work.She might not be going away to
school, but even so, that did not debar one
from new fall clothes at home."They're coming to Vergennes with me,"
Bell said."Then we can all come home
together Friday nights.""They're coming to Boston with me," Josie
corrected, "then we'll be back together for
Thanksgiving."Shirley, meekly taking her first sewing
lessons under Pauline's instructions, and frankly
declaring that she didn't at all like them,
dropped the hem she was turning."They're
coming to New York with me; and in the
between-times we'll have such fun that they'll
never want to come home.""It looks as though
Hilary and I would have a busy winter
between you all.It is a comfort to know where
we are going."she warned, when later the
party broke up."Are we going out in a blaze of glory?""You might tell us where we are going,
now, Paul," Josie urged."You wait until
Friday, like good little girls.Mind, you all
bring wraps; it'll be chilly coming home."Pauline's turn was to be the final wind-up
of the club's regular outings.No one outside
the home folks, excepting Tom, had been
taken into her confidence--it had been
necessary to press him into service.And when, on
Friday afternoon, the young people gathered
at the parsonage, all but those named were
still in the dark.Allen, Harry Oram and Patience
were there; the minister and Dr.Brice
had promised to join the party later if possible.As a rule, the club picnics were cooperative
affairs; but to-day the members, by special
request, arrived empty-handed.Paul
Shaw, learning that Pauline's turn was yet to
come, had insisted on having a share in it."I am greatly interested in this club," he
had explained."I like results, and I think,"
he glanced at Hilary's bright happy face,
"that the 'S.W. F. Club' has achieved at least
one very good result."And on the morning before the eventful
Friday, a hamper had arrived from New
York, the watching of the unpacking of which
had again transformed Patience, for the time,
from an interrogation to an exclamation point."It's a beautiful hamper," she explained to
Towser."It truly is--because father says,
it's the inner, not the outer, self that makes
for real beauty, or ugliness; and it certainly
was the inside of that hamper that counted.I wish you were going, Towser.See here,
suppose you follow on kind of quietly
to-morrow afternoon--don't show up too soon, and
I guess I can manage it."Which piece of advice Towser must have
understood.At any rate, he acted upon it to
the best of his ability, following the party at a
discreet distance through the garden and down
the road towards the lake; and only when the
halt at the pier came, did he venture near, the
most insinuating of dogs.And so successfully did Patience manage
it, that when the last boat-load pushed off
from shore, Towser sat erect on the narrow
bow seat, blandly surveying his fellow
voyagers."He does so love picnics," Patience
explained to Mr.Dayre, "and this is
the last particular one for the season.I kind
of thought he'd go along and I slipped in a
little paper of bones.""We're out on the wide ocean sailing.""I wish we
were--the water's quiet as a mill-pond this afternoon."For the great lake, appreciating perhaps
the importance of the occasion, had of its many
moods chosen to wear this afternoon its
sweetest, most beguiling one, and lay, a broad
stretch of sparkling, rippling water, between
its curving shores.Beyond, the range of mountains rose dark
and somber against the cloud-flecked sky,
their tops softened by the light haze that told
of coming autumn.And presently, from boat to boat, went the
call, "We're going to Port Edward!"But that's not _in_ Winton," Edna protested."Of it, if not in it," Jack Ward assured them."Do you reckon you can show us anything
new about that old fort, Paul Shaw?""Why, I could go all over it
blindfolded.""Not to show the new--to unfold the old,"
Pauline told him."It is--in substance," Pauline looked across
her shoulder to where Mr.Allen sat,
imparting information to Harry Oram."So that's why you asked the old fellow,"
Tracy said.They were rounding the slender point on
which the tall, white lighthouse stood, and
entering the little cove where visitors to the fort
usually beached their boats.A few rods farther inland, rose the tall,
grass-covered, circular embankment,
surrounding the crumbling, gray walls, the outer
shells of the old barracks.At the entrance to the enclosure, Tom
suddenly stepped ahead, barring the way."No
passing within this fort without the
counter-sign," he declared."'It's a
habit to be happy,'" she suggested, and Tom
drew back for her to enter.But one by one,
he exacted the password from each.Inside, within the shade of those old, gray
walls, a camp-fire had been built and
camp-kettle swung, hammocks had been hung under
the trees and when cushions were scattered
here and there the one-time fort bore anything
but a martial air.But something of the spirit of the past must
have been in the air that afternoon, or perhaps,
the spirit of the coming changes; for this
picnic--though by no means lacking in charm--was
not as gay and filled with light-hearted
chaff as usual.There was more talking in
quiet groups, or really serious searching for
some trace of those long-ago days of storm and stress.With the coming of evening, the fire was
lighted and the cloth laid within range of its
flickering shadows.The night breeze had
sprung up and from outside the sloping
embankment they caught the sound of the waves
breaking on the beach.True to their
promise, the minister and Dr.Brice appeared at
the time appointed and were eagerly welcomed
by the young people.Supper was a long, delightful affair that
night, with much talk of the days when the
fort had been devoted to far other purposes
than the present; and the young people,
listening to the tales Mr.Allen told in his quiet yet
strangely vivid way, seemed to hear the slow
creeping on of the boats outside and to be
listening in the pauses of the wind for the
approach of the enemy."I'll take it back, Paul," Tracy told her, as
they were repacking the baskets."Even the
old fort has developed new interests."W. F. Club' will
continue its good work," Jack said.Going back, Pauline found herself sitting
in the stern of one of the boats, beside her
father.The club members were singing the
club song.But Pauline's thoughts had
suddenly gone back to that wet May afternoon.She could see the dreary, rain-swept garden,
hear the beating of the drops on the
window-panes.How long ago and remote it all
seemed; how far from the hopeless discontent,
the vague longings, the real anxiety of that
time, she and Hilary had traveled."There's one thing,"
she said, "we've had one summer that I shall
always feel would be worth reliving.And
we're going to have more of them.""I am glad to hear that," Mr.Pauline looked about her--the lanterns at
the ends of the boats threw dancing lights out
across the water, no longer quiet; overhead,
the sky was bright with stars."Everything
is so beautiful," the girl said slowly."One
seems to feel it more--every day.""'The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the
Lord hath made even both of them,'" her
father quoted gravely."The
hearing ear and the seeing eye"--it was a good
thought to take with them--out into the new
life, among the new scenes.One would need
them everywhere--out in the world, as well as
in Winton.And then, from the boat just
ahead, sounded Patience's clear
treble,--"'There's a Good Time Coming.'"The object is gained, if
the lecturer awakens in his hearers a real interest in the subject on
which he speaks, and if he sends them to the proper sources of more
minute knowledge.If I can in this way send every one who wishes to
understand the early institutions of his country to the great work of
Professor Stubbs—none the less great because it lies in an amazingly
small compass—my own work will be effectually done.Stubbs’
“Documents Illustrative of English History,” the ordinary student
will find all that he can want to learn; while he who means to write
a book, or to carry out his studies in a more minute way, will find
the best of guidance towards so doing.The great documents of early
English history, hitherto scattered far and wide, are now for the first
time brought together, and their bearing is expounded in a continuous
narrative worthy of the unerring learning and critical power of the
first of living scholars.For my own part, my object has been to show that the earliest
institutions of England and of other Teutonic lands are not mere
matters of curious speculation, but matters closely connected with
our present political being.I wish to show that, in many things, our
earliest institutions come more nearly home to us, and that they have
more in common with our present political state, than the institutions
of intermediate ages which at first sight seem to have much more in
common with our own.As the continuity of our national life is to many
so hard a lesson to master, so the continuity of our political life,
and the way in which we have so often fallen back on the very earliest
principles of our race, is a lesson which many find specially hard.But
the holders of Liberal principles in modern politics need never shrink
from tracing up our political history to its earliest beginnings.As
far at least as our race is concerned, freedom is everywhere older
than bondage; we may add that toleration is older than intolerance.Our ancient history is the possession of the Liberal, who, as being
ever ready to reform, is the true Conservative, not of the self-styled
Conservative who, by refusing to reform, does all he can to bring on
destruction.One special point on which I have dwelt is the way in
which our constitutional history has been perverted at the hands of
lawyers.It is perfectly true that the history of England must be
studied in the Statute-Book, but it must be in a Statute-Book which
begins at no point later than the Dooms of Æthelberht.As I have often had need to take facts and doctrines for granted which
I believe myself to have proved in my larger works, I have in the Notes
given frequent references to those works, instead of bringing in the
evidence for the same things over again.And in the more modern part
of the subject, I have given several extracts at full length, even
from very familiar authors, because I know that a reader is often well
pleased to have a striking passage set before him at once, without
having to seek for it in the original.On the other hand, I have given
at full length several extracts from statutes and other documents which
most readers are not likely to have at hand.The historical portions
of any Act of Parliament can be studied only in the Acts themselves,
and not in the summaries of lawyers.Legal writers and speakers seem
constantly to repeat what has been said before them, without any
reference to the original sources.A memorable example is to be found
in the assertion of Blackstone and of a crowd of lawyers after him, in
Parliament and out of Parliament, that the King or Queen is by Law Head
of the Church.I need hardly say that that title was used by Henry,
Edward, and Mary, but that it was given up by Mary, and was not taken
up again by any later Sovereign.SOMERLEAZE, WELLS,

improvements, and I have made two or three additions to the Notes.SOMERLEAZE, WELLS,

THE GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION FROM THE _EARLIEST TIMES_.CHAPTER I.


Year by year, on certain spots among the dales and the mountain-sides
of Switzerland, the traveller who is daring enough to wander out of
beaten tracks and to make his journey at unusual seasons may look on a
sight such as no other corner of the earth can any longer set before
him.He may there gaze and feel, what none can feel but those who have
seen with their own eyes, what none can feel in its fulness more than
once in a lifetime, the thrill of looking for the first time face to
face on freedom in its purest and most ancient form.He is there in a
land where the oldest institutions of our race, institutions which may
be traced up to the earliest times of which history or legend gives us
any glimmering, still live on in their primæval freshness.He is in
a land where an immemorial freedom, a freedom only less eternal than
the rocks that guard it, puts to shame the boasted antiquity of kingly
dynasties, which, by its side, seem but as innovations of yesterday.There, year by year, on some bright morning of the spring-tide, the
Sovereign People, not entrusting its rights to a few of its own number,
but discharging them itself in the majesty of its corporate person,
meets in the open market-place or in the green meadow at the mountain’s
foot, to frame the laws to which it yields obedience as its own work,
to choose the rulers whom it can afford to greet with reverence as
drawing their commission from itself.Such a sight there are but few
Englishmen who have seen; to be among those few I reckon among the
highest privileges of my life.Let me ask you to follow me in spirit
to the very home and birth-place of freedom, to the land where we need
not myth and fable to add aught to the fresh and gladdening feeling
with which we for the first time tread the soil and drink in the
air of the immemorial democracy of Uri(1).It is one of the opening
days of May; it is the morning of Sunday; for men there deem that
the better the day the better the deed; they deem that the Creator
cannot be more truly honoured than in using, in His fear and in His
presence, the highest of the gifts which He has bestowed on man.But
deem not that, because the day of Christian worship is chosen for the
great yearly assembly of a Christian commonwealth, the more directly
sacred duties of the day are forgotten.Before we, in our luxurious
island, have lifted ourselves from our beds, the men of the mountains,
Catholic and Protestant alike, have already paid the morning’s worship
in God’s temple.They have heard the mass of the priest or they have
listened to the sermon of the pastor, before some of us have awakened
to the fact that the morn of the holy day has come.And when I saw men
thronging the crowded church, or kneeling, for want of space within,
on the bare ground beside the open door, when I saw them marching
thence to do the highest duties of men and citizens, I could hardly
forbear thinking of the saying of Holy Writ, that “where the Spirit
of the Lord is, there is liberty.” From the market-place of Altdorf,
the little capital of the Canton, the procession makes its way to the
place of meeting at Böblingen.First marches the little army of the
Canton, an army whose weapons never can be used save to drive back an
invader from their land(2).Over their heads floats the banner, the
bull’s head of Uri, the ensign which led men to victory on the fields
of Sempach and Morgarten.And before them all, on the shoulders of men
clad in a garb of ages past, are borne the famous horns, the spoils of
the wild bull of ancient days, the very horns whose blast struck such
dread into the fearless heart of Charles of Burgundy(3).Then, with
their lictors before them, come the magistrates of the commonwealth on
horseback(4), the chief magistrate, the Landammann, with his sword by
his side.The people follow the chiefs whom they have chosen to the
place of meeting, a circle in a green meadow, with a pine forest rising
above their heads and a mighty spur of the mountain range facing them
on the other side of the valley.The multitude of freemen take their
seats around the chief ruler of the commonwealth, whose term of office
comes that day to an end.The Assembly opens; a short space is first
given to prayer, silent prayer offered up by each man in the temple
of God’s own rearing.If changes
in the law are demanded, they are then laid before the vote of the
Assembly, in which each citizen of full age has an equal vote and an
equal right of speech.The yearly magistrates have now discharged all
their duties; their term of office is at an end; the trust which has
been placed in their hands falls back into the hands of those by whom
it was given, into the hands of the sovereign people.The chief of the
commonwealth, now such no longer, leaves his seat of office and takes
his place as a simple citizen in the ranks of his fellows.It rests
with the free will of the Assembly to call him back to his chair of
office, or to set another there in his stead.Men who have neither
looked into the history of the past, nor yet troubled themselves
to learn what happens year by year in their own age, are fond of
declaiming against the caprice and ingratitude of the people, and of
telling us that under a democratic government neither men nor measures
can remain for an hour unchanged.The witness alike of the present and
of the past is an answer to baseless theories like these.The spirit
which made democratic Athens year by year bestow her highest offices
on the patrician Periklês and the reactionary Phôkiôn(5) still lives
in the democracies of Switzerland, alike in the Landesgemeinde of Uri
and in the Federal Assembly at Bern.The ministers of Kings, whether
despotic or constitutional, may vainly envy the sure tenure of office
which falls to the lot of those who are chosen to rule by the voice of
the people.Alike in the whole Confederation and in the single Canton
reelection is the rule; the rejection of the out-going magistrate is
the rare exception(6).The Landammann of Uri, whom his countrymen
have raised to the seat of honour, and who has done nothing to lose
their confidence, need not fear that when he has gone to the place of
meeting in the pomp of office, his place in the march homeward will be
transferred to another against his will.Such is the scene, which, save for a moment, when the world was turned
upside down by the inroads of revolutionary France(7), has gone on
year by year as far as history goes back in the most unchanged of
European states.Let me ask you to follow me yet again to the place of
assembly of a younger member of the same noble band of commonwealths
(8), to pass from Uri to Appenzell, from the green meadows of Bözlingen
to the hill-side market-place of Trogen.Somewhat of the pomp and
circumstance which marks the assembly of Catholic and pastoral Uri is
lacking in the assembly of the Protestant and industrial population of
the Outer Rhodes of Appenzell.But the stamp of antiquity, the stamp
of immemorial freedom, is impressed alike on the assembly and on the
whole life of either commonwealth.We miss in Appenzell the solemn
procession, the mounted magistrates, the military pomp, of Uri, but
we find in their stead an immemorial custom which breathes perhaps
more than any other the spirit of days when freedom was not a thing of
course, but a thing for which men had to give their toil and, if need
be, their blood.Each man who makes his way to the Landesgemeinde of
Trogen bears at his side the sword which the law at once commands him
to carry and forbids him to draw(9).And in the proceedings of the
assembly itself, the men of Appenzell have kept one ancient rite, which
surpasses all that I have ever seen or heard of in its heart-stirring
solemnity.When the newly chosen Landammann enters on his office,
his first duty is to bind himself by an oath to obey the laws of the
commonwealth over which he is called to rule.His second duty is to
administer to the multitude before him the same oath by which he has
just bound himself.To hear the voice of thousands of freemen pledging
themselves to obey the laws which they themselves have made is a moment
in one’s life which can never be forgotten, a moment for whose sake it
would be worth while to take a far longer and harder journey than that
which leads us to Uri or Appenzell.And now I may be asked why I have begun a discourse on the constitution
of England with a picture of the doings of two small commonwealths
whose political and social state is so widely different from our own.I
answer that I have done so because my object is, not merely to speak of
the constitution of England in the shape which the changes of fourteen
hundred years have at last given it, but to trace back those successive
changes to the earliest times which either history or tradition sets
before us.In the institutions of Uri and Appenzell, and in others of
the Swiss Cantons which have never departed from the primæval model, we
may see the institutions of our own forefathers, the institutions which
were once common to the whole Teutonic race, institutions whose outward
form has necessarily passed away from greater states, but which contain
the germs out of which every free constitution in the world has grown.Let us look back to the earliest picture which history can give us of
the political and social being of our own forefathers.In the Germany
of Tacitus we have the picture of the institutions of the Teutonic race
before our branch of that race sailed from the mouths of the Elbe and
the Weser to seek new homes by the Humber and the Thames.There, in the
picture of our fathers and brethren seventeen hundred years back, the
free Teutonic Assembly, the armed Assembly of the whole people, is set
before us, well nigh the same, in every essential point, as it may
still be seen in Uri, Unterwalden, Glarus, and Appenzell.One point
however must be borne in mind.In the assemblies of those small Cantons
it is only the most democratic side of the old Teutonic constitution
which comes prominently into sight.The commonwealth of Uri, by the
peculiar circumstances of its history, grew into an independent and
sovereign state.But in its origin it was not a nation, it was not
even a tribe(10).The Landesgemeinden of which I have been speaking
are the Assemblies, not of a nation but of a district; they answer in
our own land, not to the Assemblies of the whole Kingdom, but to the
lesser Assemblies of the shire or the hundred.But they are not on
that account any the less worthy of our notice, they do not on that
account throw any the less light on that common political heritage
which belongs alike to Swabia and to England.In every Teutonic land
which still keeps any footsteps of its ancient institutions, the
local divisions are not simply administrative districts traced out
for convenience on the map.In fact, they are not divisions at all;
they are not divisions of the Kingdom, but the earlier elements out
of whose union the Kingdom grew.Yorkshire, by that name, is younger
than England, but Yorkshire, by its elder name of Deira, is older than
England(11).And Yorkshire or Deira itself is younger than the smaller
districts of which it is made up, Craven, Cleveland, Holderness, and
others.The Landesgemeinde of Uri answers, not to an Assembly of
all England, not to an Assembly of all Deira, but to an Assembly of
Holderness or Cleveland.But in the old Teutonic system the greater
aggregate was simply organized after the model of the lesser elements
out of whose union it was formed.In fact, for the political unit,
for the atom which joined with its fellow atoms to form the political
whole, we must go to areas yet smaller than those of Holderness or
Uri.That unit, that atom, the true kernel of all our political life,
must be looked for in Switzerland in the _Gemeinde_ or _Commune_; in
England—smile not while I say it—in the parish vestry(12).The primitive Teutonic constitution, the constitution of the Germans
of Tacitus, the constitution which has lingered on in a few remote
corners of the old German realm, is democratic, but it is not purely
democratic.Or rather it is democratic, purely democratic, in the
truer, older, and more honourable sense of that much maligned word;
it is not purely democratic in that less honourable, but purely
arbitrary, sense which is often put upon it in modern controversy.Democracy, according to Periklês, is a government of the whole
people, as opposed to oligarchy, a government of only a part of the
people(13).A government which vests all power in any one class, a
government which shuts out any one class, whether that class be the
highest or the lowest, does not answer the definition of Periklês;
it is not a government of the whole but only of a part; it is not a
democracy but an oligarchy(14).Democracy, in the sense of Periklês,
demands that every freeman shall have a voice in the affairs of the
commonwealth; it does not necessarily demand that every freeman should
have an equal voice.It does not forbid the existence of magistrates
clothed with high authority and held in high reverence, nor does it
forbid respect for ancient birth or even an attachment to an hereditary
line of rulers.The older school of English constitutional writers
delighted to show that the English Constitution contained a monarchic,
an aristocratic, and a democratic element, the three being wrought
together in such true and harmonious proportion that we could enjoy
the good side of all the three great forms of government without ever
seeing the evil side of any of them.These worthy speculators were
perhaps a little Utopian in their theories; still there is no doubt
that, in every glimpse we get of old Teutonic politics, we see what we
may fairly call a monarchic, an aristocratic, and a democratic element.Those earliest glimpses set before us three classes of men as found in
every Teutonic society, the noble, the common freeman, and the slave
(15).The existence of the slave, harshly as the name now grates on our
ears, is no special shame or blame to our own forefathers.Slavery, in
some shape or other, has unhappily been the common law of most nations
in most ages; it is a mere exception to the general rule that, partly
through the circumstances of most European countries, partly through
the growth of humanity and civilization, the hateful institution has,
during a few centuries past, gradually disappeared from a certain
portion of the earth’s surface.And we must not forget that, in many
states of society, the doom of slavery may have been thankfully
received as an alleviation of his lot by the man whose life was
forfeited either as a prisoner in merciless warfare or as a wrong-doer
sentenced for his crimes(16).But I mention the existence of slavery
only that we may remember that when we speak of freedom, freeman,
democracy, and the like, we are after all speaking of the rights of
a privileged class—that, whether in Athens, in Rome, or in the early
Teutonic communities, there was always a large mass of human beings
who had no share in the freedom, the victory, or the glory of their
masters.We are now more closely concerned with those distinctions
which, from the earliest times, we find among the freemen themselves.In the Germany of Tacitus, as at this day in the democratic Cantons,
the sovereign power is vested in the whole people, acting directly in
their own persons.But if the sovereignty of the popular Assembly is
plainly set before us, we have also no less plainly set before us the
existence of a Council smaller than the popular Assembly, and also
the existence of a class of nobles, the nature and extent of whose
privileges is not very well defined, but who clearly had privileges
of some kind or other, and whose privileges passed on by hereditary
descent.Here we have an aristocratic element as distinctly marked as
the democratic element which is supplied by the popular Assembly.And
at the head of all we see personal chiefs of tribes and nations, chiefs
bearing different titles, Kings, Dukes, or Ealdormen, who in most cases
drew their title to rule from an union of birth and election, rulers
whom the nation chose and whom the nation could depose, but who still
were the personal leaders of the nation, its highest magistrates in
peace, its highest leaders in war.Here then, besides the democratic
and the aristocratic elements, we have a distinct monarchic element
standing out clearly in our earliest glimpses of Teutonic political
life.King, Lords, and Commons, in their present shapes, are something
comparatively recent, but we may see something which may fairly pass as
the germ of King, Lords, and Commons, from the very beginning of our
history.The Constitution which I have just
sketched is indeed the common possession of the Teutonic race, but it
is something more.We should perhaps not be wrong if we were to call
it a common possession of the whole Aryan family of mankind.It is
possible that we may even find traces of it beyond the bounds of the
Aryan family(17).But I will put speculations like these aside.It is
enough for me that the Constitution which was the common heritage of
the Teutonic race, was an heritage which the Teuton shared with his
kinsfolk in Greece and Italy.Turn to the earliest records of European
civilization.In the Homeric poems we see a constitution, essentially
the same as that which is set before us in the Germany of Tacitus,
established alike in the Achaian camp before Ilios, in the island
realm of Ithakê, and even among the Gods on Olympos.Zeus is the King
of all; but he has around him his Council of the greater Gods, and
there are times when he summons to his court the whole Assembly of the
Divine nation, when Gods of all ranks gather together in the court of
their chief, when, save old Ocean himself, even all the River-gods were
there, and when we are specially told—a fact which might perhaps be
pressed into the service of very recent controversies—that not one of
the Nymphs stayed away(18).If we come down to earth, we find the King
of Men as the common leader of all, but we find him surrounded by his
inner Council of lesser princes and captains.And on great occasions,
Agamemnôn on earth, like Zeus in heaven, gathers together the general
Assembly of freeborn warriors, an assembly in which, if debate was
mainly confined to a few eloquent leaders, the common freeman, the
undistinguished citizen and soldier, had at least the right of speaking
his mind as to the proposals of his chiefs, by loud applause or by
emphatic silence(19).Nor is this picture confined to the host in
battle array beneath the walls of Ilios; we must remember that in
all early societies the distinction between soldier and civilian is
unknown; the army is the nation, and the nation is the army.The same
picture which the Iliad sets before us as the constitution of the
Achaian army is set before us in the glimpses of more peaceful life
which we find in the Odyssey as being no less the constitution of
every Hellenic commonwealth on its own soil.Everywhere we find the
same three elements, the supreme leader or King, the lesser chiefs who
form his Council, and the final authority of all, the general Assembly
of the freemen(20).We see the same in every glimpse which history
or legend gives us of the political state of Rome and the other old
Italian commonwealths(21).Everywhere we find the King, the Senate,
the Assembly of the people, and the distribution of powers is not
essentially changed when the highest personal authority is transferred
from the hands of a King chosen for life to the hands of Consuls
chosen for a year(22).The likeness between the earliest political
institutions of the Greek, the Italian, and the Teuton is so close,
so striking in every detail, that we can hardly fail to see in it
possession handed on from the earliest times, a possession which Greek,
Italian, and Teuton already had in the days before the separation, in
those unrecorded but still authentic times when Greek, Italian, and
Teuton were still a single people speaking a single tongue.I have referred more than once to the picture of our race in its
earliest recorded times, as set before us by the greatest of Roman
historians in the Germany of Tacitus.Let me now set before you some
special points of his description in his own words as well as I am able
to clothe them in an English dress(23).“They choose their Kings on account of their nobility, their leaders on
account of their valour.Nor have the Kings an unbounded or arbitrary
power, and the leaders rule rather by their example than by the right
of command; if they are ready, if they are foreward, if they are
foremost in leading the van, they hold the first place in honour....
On smaller matters the chiefs debate, on greater matters all men; but
so that those things whose final decision rests with the whole people
are first handled by the chiefs.... The multitude sits armed in such
order as it thinks good; silence is proclaimed by the priests, who have
also the right of enforcing it.Presently the King or chief, according
to the age of each, according to his birth, according to his glory in
war or his eloquence, is listened to, speaking rather by the influence
of persuasion than by the power of commanding.If their opinions give
offence, they are thrust aside with a shout; if they are approved, the
hearers clash their spears.It is held to be the most honourable kind
of applause to use their weapons to signify approval.It is lawful also
in the assembly to bring matters for trial and to bring charges of
capital crimes.... In the same assembly chiefs are chosen to administer
justice through the districts and villages.Each chief in so doing has
a hundred companions of the commons assigned to him, as at once his
counsellors and his authority.Moreover they do no matter of business,
public or private, except in arms.”

Here we have a picture of a free commonwealth of warriors, in which
each freeman has his place in the state, where the vote of the general
Assembly is the final authority on all matters, but where both
hereditary descent and elective office are held in high honour.We
see also in a marked way the influence of personal character and of
the power of speech; we see the existence of local divisions, local
assemblies, local magistrates; in a word, we see in this picture of
our forefathers in their old land, seventeen hundred years ago, the
germs of all the institutions which have grown up step by step among
ourselves in the course of ages.And a Swiss of the democratic Cantons
would see in it, not merely the germs of his constitution, but the
living picture of the thing itself.This immemorial Teutonic constitution was thus the constitution of our
forefathers in their old land of Northern Germany, before they made
their way into the Isle of Britain.And that constitution, in all its
essential points, they brought with them into their new homes, and
there, transplanted to a new soil, it grew and flourished, and brought
forth fruit richer and more lasting than it brought forth in the land
of its earlier birth.On the Teutonic mainland, the old Teutonic
freedom, with its free assemblies, national and local, gradually died
out before the encroachments of a brood of petty princes(24).In the
Teutonic island it has changed its form from age to age; it has lived
through many storms and it has withstood the attacks of many enemies,
but it has never utterly died out.The continued national life of the
people, notwithstanding foreign conquests and internal revolutions, has
remained unbroken for fourteen hundred years.At no moment has the tie
between the present and the past been wholly rent asunder; at no moment
have Englishmen sat down to put together a wholly new constitution in
obedience to some dazzling theory.Each step in our growth has been the
natural consequence of some earlier step; each change in our law and
constitution has been, not the bringing in of anything wholly new, but
the developement and improvement of something that was already old.Our progress has in some ages been faster, in others slower; at some
moments we have seemed to stand still, or even to go back; but the
great march of political developement has never wholly stopped; it has
never been permanently checked since the day when the coming of the
Teutonic conquerors first began to change Britain into England.New
and foreign elements have from time to time thrust themselves into our
law; but the same spirit which could develope and improve whatever was
old and native has commonly found means sooner or later to cast forth
again whatever was new and foreign.The lover of freedom, the lover of
progress, the man who has eyes keen enough to discover real identity
under a garb of outward unlikeness, need never shrink from tracing up
the political institutions of England to their earliest shape.The
fourteen hundred years of English history are the possession of those
who would ever advance, not the possession of those who would stand
still or go backwards.The wisdom of our forefathers was ever shown,
not in a dull and senseless clinging to things as they were at any
given moment, but in that spirit, the spirit alike of the true reformer
and the true conservative, which keeps the whole fabric standing, by
repairing and improving from time to time whatever parts of it stand in
need of repair or improvement.Let ancient customs prevail(25); let
us ever stand fast in the old paths.But the old paths have in England
ever been the paths of progress; the ancient custom has ever been to
shrink from mere change for the sake of change, but fearlessly to
change whenever change was really needed.And many of the best changes
of later times, many of the most wholesome improvements in our Law and
Constitution, have been only the casting aside of innovations which
have crept in in modern and evil times.They have been the calling up
again, in an altered garb, of principles as old as the days when we get
our first sight of our forefathers in their German forests.Changed as
it is in all outward form and circumstance, the England in which we
live, has, in its true life and spirit, far more in common with the
England of the earliest times than it has with the England of days far
nearer to our own.In many a wholesome act of modern legislation, we
have gone back, wittingly or unwittingly, to the earliest principles
of our race.We have advanced by falling back on a more ancient state
of things; we have reformed by calling to life again the institutions
of earlier and ruder times, by setting ourselves free from the slavish
subtleties of Norman lawyers, by casting aside as an accursed thing the
innovations of Tudor tyranny and Stewart usurpation.I have said that the primæval Teutonic constitution was brought with
them by our Teutonic forefathers when they came as conquerors into the
Isle of Britain.I will not again go into the details of the English
Conquest, the settlement which gave us a new home in a new land, nor
into all the questions and controversies to which the details of the
English Conquest have given rise.I have spoken of them over and over
again with my voice and with my pen, and I hope I may now take for
granted what I have fully argued out elsewhere(26).I hope that I
may be allowed to assume the plain facts of the case, without going
through the details of every point.I will assume then—for it is that
to which the question really comes—that England is England and that
Englishmen are Englishmen.I will assume that we are not Romans or
Welshmen, but that we are the descendants of the Angles, Saxons, and
Jutes who came hither in the fifth and sixth centuries, of the Danes
and Northmen who came hither in the ninth.I will assume that we are
a people, not indeed of unmixed Teutonic blood—for no people in the
world is of absolutely unmixed blood—but a people whose blood is not
more mixed than that of any other nation; that Englishmen are as truly
Englishmen as Britons are Britons or as High-Germans are High-Germans.I will assume that what is Teutonic in us is not merely one element
among others, but that it is the very life and essence of our national
being; that whatever else we may have in us, whatever we have drawn
from those whom we conquered or from those who conquered us, is no
coordinate element, but a mere infusion into our Teutonic essence;
in a word I will assume that Englishmen are Englishmen, that we are
ourselves and not some other people.I assume all this; if any man
disputes it, if any man chooses not to be an Englishman but to be a
Welshman or a Roman, I cannot argue with him now; I can only ask him to
turn to the arguments which I have urged on all those points in other
times and places.I assume that, as we have had one national name, one
national speech, from the beginning, we may be fairly held to have an
unbroken national being.And when we find a Teutonic-speaking people
in Britain living under the same political and social forms as the
Teutonic-speaking people of the mainland, it is surely no very rash or
far-fetched inference that the tongue and the laws which they have in
common are a common possession drawn from a common source; that the
island colony in short came itself, and brought its laws and language
with it, from the elder mother-land beyond the sea.Our fathers then came into Britain, and they brought with them the
same primæval political system, the same distinctions of rank, the
same division of political power, which they had been used to in their
elder Anglian and Saxon homes.The circumstances of the Conquest would
no doubt bring about some changes.It would probably tend to increase
the numbers of the class of slaves.Such of the natives as were neither
slain nor driven out would of course pass into that class.Especially,
though there is no doubt that our forefathers brought their women with
them from their own homes, there is no doubt that many British women
passed into bondage, so much so that one of the common Old-English
names for a female slave is _Wylne_ or _Welshwoman_(27).And we may
infer that this increased familiarity with slavery would tend to
strengthen the custom by which freemen guilty of crimes were reduced
to slavery by sentence of law.Again, I suspect that the circumstances
of the Conquest did something to raise the position both of the common
freeman and of the King or leader, as compared with the intermediate
class of nobles.No two things are more levelling than colonization and
successful warfare.The levelling effect of colonization is obvious;
the levelling effect of warfare is not so obvious in modern times.In
modern armies, where there is a strictly defined system of military
ranks, where the distinction of officer and private is broadly drawn,
where the private soldier is little more than a machine in the hands of
his commander, the effect may even be the other way.But in an earlier
state of things, where victory depends on the individual prowess of
each man, nothing can be more levelling than warfare.Honour and profit
fall to the lot of the stoutest heart and the strongest arm, whether
their owner be noble or peasant in his own land.And this would be
still more the case when war and colonization went hand in hand, when
success brought not only victory but conquest, when men fought, not
to go back loaded with glory and plunder to their old homes, but to
win for themselves new homes as the reward of their valour.On the
other hand, in an early state of things personal influence is almost
everything; a vigorous and popular ruler is practically absolute,
because no one has the wish to withstand his will, but a weak or
unpopular ruler can exercise no authority whatever.In such a state of
things as this no one can so easily gain the authority of unbounded
influence as the military chief who leads his tribe to victory.And
again, that influence would be increased tenfold when the successful
chief led them not only to victory but to conquest, when he was not
only a ruler but a founder, the man who had led his people to win for
themselves a new land, to create a new state, the prize of his sword
and of theirs.Mere nobility of birth, however highly honoured, would
be but a feeble influence compared with either of these influences
above and below it.I think that we may trace something of the results
of these influences in the position of the oldest English nobility.That there was a difference between the noble and the common freeman,
in Old-English phrase between the _Eorl_ and the _Ceorl_(28), is shown
by countless allusions to the distinction in our earliest records.But
it is by no means easy to say what the distinction really was.And,
as we shall presently see that this primitive nobility gradually gave
way to a nobility of quite another kind and founded on quite another
principle, we may perhaps be inclined to think that, at least after the
settlement of the English in Britain, the privileges of the _Eorlas_
were little more than honorary.I need hardly say that a traditional
deference for high birth, a traditional preference for men of certain
families in the disposal of elective offices, may go on when birth
carries with it no legal privilege whatever.Nowhere has this been more
strikingly shown than in those democratic Cantons of Switzerland of
which I have already spoken.In a commonwealth where magistrates were
chosen yearly, where every freeman had an equal vote in their choice,
it still happened that, year after year, the representatives of certain
famous houses were chosen as if by hereditary right.Such were the
Barons of Attinghausen in Uri and the house of Tschudi in Glarus(29).And, whatever we say of such a custom in other ways, it was surely
well suited to have a good effect on the members of these particular
families; it was well suited to raise up in them a succession of men
fitted to hold the high offices of the commonwealth.A man who knows
that, if he be at all worthy of a certain post of honour, he will be
chosen to it before any other man, but who also knows that, if he
shows himself unworthy of it, he may either fail to attain it at all
or may be peacefully removed from it at the end of any twelvemonth, is
surely under stronger motives to make himself worthy of the place which
he hopes to fill than either the man who has to run the chance of an
unlimited competition or the man who succeeds to honour and authority
by the mere right of his birth.Our fathers then came into Britain, bringing with them the three
elements of the primitive constitution which we find described by
Tacitus; but as I am inclined to think, the circumstances of the
Conquest did something, for a while at least, to strengthen the powers
both of the supreme chief and of the general body of the people at the
expense of the intermediate class of _Eorlas_ or nobles.Let us first
trace the origin and growth of the power of the supreme leader, in
other words, the monarchic element, the kingly power.The question is much more easily asked than answered.The name
of King has meant very different things in different times and places;
the amount of authority attached to the title has varied greatly in
different times and places.Still a kind of common idea seems to run
through all its different uses; if we cannot always define a King,
we at least commonly know a King when we see him.The King has, in
popular sentiment at least, a vague greatness and sanctity attaching
to him which does not attach to any mere magistrate, however high
in rank and authority.I am not talking of the reason of the thing,
but of what, as a matter of fact, has at all times been the popular
feeling.Among the heathen Swedes, it is said that, when public affairs
went wrong,—that is, in the state of things when we should now turn
a Minister out of office and when our forefathers some generations
back would have cut off his head,—they despised any such secondary
victims, and offered the King himself in sacrifice to the Gods(30).Such a practice certainly implies that our Scandinavian kinsfolk
had not reached that constitutional subtlety according to which the
responsibility of all the acts of the Sovereign is transferred to some
one else.They clearly did not, like modern constitution-makers, look
on the person of the King as inviolable and sacred.But I suspect
that the very practice which shows that they did not look on him as
inviolable shows that they did look on him as sacred.Surely the reason
why the King was sacrificed rather than any one else was because there
was something about him which there was not about any one else, because
no meaner victim would have been equally acceptable to the Gods.On
the other hand—to stray for a moment beyond the range of Teutonic and
even of Aryan precedent—we read that the ancient Egyptians forestalled
the great device of constitutional monarchy, that their priests,
in a yearly discourse, dutifully attributed all the good that was
done in the land to the King personally and all the evil to his bad
counsellors(31).These may seem two exactly opposite ways of treating
a King; but the practice of sacrificing the King, and the practice of
treating the King as one who can do no wrong, both start from the
same principle, the principle that the King is, somehow or other,
inherently different from everybody else.Our own Old-English Kings,
like all other Teutonic Kings, were anything but absolute rulers; the
nation chose them and the nation could depose them; they could do no
important act in peace or war without the national assent; yet still
the King, as the King, was felt to hold a rank differing in kind from
the rank held by the highest of his subjects.Perhaps the distinction
mainly consisted in a certain religious sentiment which attached
to the person of the King, and did not attach to the person of any
inferior chief.In heathen times, the Kings traced up their descent
to the Gods whom the nation worshipped; in Christian times, they were
distinguished from lesser rulers by being admitted to their office
with ecclesiastical ceremonies; the chosen of the people became also
the Anointed of the Lord.The distinction between Kings and rulers of
any other kind is strictly immemorial; it is as old as anything that
we know of the political institutions of our race.The distinction is
clearly marked in the description which I read to you from Tacitus.He
distinguishes in a marked way _Reges_ and _Duces_, Kings and Leaders;
Kings whose claim to rule rested on their birth, and leaders whose
claim to rule rested on their personal merit.But from the same writer
we learn that, though the distinction was so early established and so
well understood, it still was not universal among all the branches of
the Teutonic race.Of the German nations described by Tacitus, some,
he expressly tells us, were governed by Kings, while others were
not(32).That is to say, each tribe or district had its own chief, its
magistrate in peace and its leader in war, but the whole nation was
not united under any one chief who had any claim to the special and
mysterious privileges of kingship.That is to say, though we hear of
kingship as far back as our accounts will carry us, yet kingship was
not the oldest form of government among the Teutonic tribes.The King
and his Kingdom came into being by the union of several distinct tribes
or districts, which already existed under distinct leaders of their
own, and in our own early history we can mark with great clearness the
date and circumstances of the introduction of kingship.We should be
well pleased to know what were the exact Teutonic words which Tacitus
expressed by the Latin equivalents _Rex_ and _Dux_.As for the latter
at least, we can make a fair guess.The Teutonic chief who was not a
King bore the title of _Ealdorman_ in peace and of _Heretoga_ in war.It still lives on among us,
though with somewhat less than its ancient dignity.The other title
of _Heretoga_, army-leader, exactly answering to the Latin _Dux_, has
dropped out of our own language, but it survives in High-German under
the form of _Herzog_, which is familiarly and correctly translated
by _Duke_(33).The _Duces_ of Tacitus, there can be no doubt, were
_Ealdormen_ or _Heretogan_.It is less clear what the title was which
he intended by _Rex_.Our word _Cyning, King_, is common to all the
existing Teutonic tongues, and we find it as far back as we can trace
the English language(34).But it is not the only, nor seemingly the
oldest, word to express the idea.In the oldest monument of Teutonic
speech, the Gothic translation of the Scriptures, the word _King_, in
any of its forms, is not found.The word there used is _Thiudans_(35).And there is a third word _Drihten_, which in English is most commonly
used in a religious sense(36).I would ask you to bear with me while
I plunge for a moment into some obsolete Teutonic etymologies, as
I think that the analogies of these three words are not a little
interesting.All three names come from, or are closely connected with,
words meaning the race or people.One of those words, _Cyn_ or _Kin_,
we still keep in modern English with no change of sound and with very
little change of meaning.Now, the word _Cyning_, in its shortened
form _King_, either comes straight from the substantive _Cyn_, or else
from a closely connected adjective _Cyne_, noble, just like the Latin
_generosus_ from Genus, which, let me add, is the same word as our
English _Cyn_.Let no one delude you into thinking that _King_ has
anything to do with the _canning_ or _cunning_ man.The man who first
said that it had had simply not learned his Old-English grammar(37).It has to do with _Cyn_ and _Cyne_, and it may be taken as “the noble
one,” or, as _ing_ is the Teutonic patronymic, any one that chooses may
thus form _Cyning_ from _Cyn_, and make the King, not the father of his
people, but their offspring(38).Now the other two names, _Thiudans_
or _Theoden_, and _Drihten_, have dropped out of our language, and so
have the two words with which they are connected, just as _Cyning_ is
connected with _Cyn_._Thiduans_ or _Theoden_ comes from _Thiuda_ or
_Theod_, also meaning _people_, a word which you will recognize in many
of the old Teutonic names, _Theodric_, _Theodberht_, _Theodbald_, and
the like.So _Drihten_ either comes straight from _Driht_, a family or
company, or else, just like _Cyn_ and _Cyne_, from an adjective _driht_
meaning noble or lordly.All these three names expressing kingship have
thus to do with words meaning the race or people.They imply the chief
of a people, something more than the chief of a mere tribe or district.Now in our Old-English Chronicles, when they tell how the first English
Conquerors, Hengest and Horsa, settled in Kent, they do not call them
_Cyningas_ but _Heretogan_, Leaders or Dukes.It is not till after some
victories over the Britons that we hear that Hengest took the _rice_ or
kingdom, and that his son Æsc is called _King_.So in Wessex, the first
conquerors Cerdic and Cynric are called _Ealdormen_ when they land;
but, when they have established a settled dominion at the expense of
the Welsh, we read that they too took the _rice_, and the leaders of
the West-Saxons are henceforth spoken of as Kings(39).It is plain then
that the first leaders of the English settlements in Britain, when they
came over, bore only the lowlier title of _Heretoga_ or _Ealdorman_; it
was only when they had fought battles and found themselves at the head
of a powerful and victorious settlement on the conquered soil that they
were thought worthy of the higher title of Kings.And we may further
believe that, with all their exploits they would not have been thought
worthy of it, if they had not been held to come of the blood of the
Gods, of the divine stock of Woden.We thus see that kingship in the strict sense of the word, as
distinguished from the government of Dukes or Ealdormen, had its
beginning among the English in Britain, not in the very first moment
of the Conquest, but in the years which immediately followed it,
within the lifetime of the first generation of conquerors.The same
distinction which we find among the Angles and Saxons we find also
among the kindred nations of Scandinavia.When the Danes and Northmen
began those invasions which led to such important settlements in
Northern and Eastern England, we always find two marked classes of
leaders, the Kings and the _Jarls_, the same word as _Eorl_.Of these
the _Jarls_ answer to the English _Ealdormen_(40).The distinction is
again clearly marked, when we read that the Old-Saxons, the Saxons
of the mainland, were ruled, not by Kings, but by what our Latin
writer is pleased to call _Satraps_—that is, of course, _Dukes_ or
_Ealdormen_(41).But it is most strongly marked of all in several
accounts where we read of nations which had been united under Kings
falling back again upon the earlier dominion of these smaller local
chiefs.Thus the Lombards in Italy, who had been led by Kings to
their great conquest, are said for a while to have given up kingly
government, and to have again set up a rule of independent Dukes.So the West-Saxons in our own island are said at one time to have
cast away kingly government, and to have in the like sort fallen back
on the rule of independent _Ealdormen_(42).In all these cases, we
should be glad to know more clearly than we do what was the exact
distinction between the _King_ and the _Duke_ or _Ealdorman_.But it
is plain that the King was the representative of a closer national
unity, while the Ealdorman represented the tendency on the part of each
tribe or district to claim independence for itself.The government of
the Ealdorman may not have been less effective than that of the King.If we remember the distinction drawn by Tacitus as to the respective
qualifications for the two offices, we may even believe that the rule
of the Ealdorman may have been the more effective.But we may be sure
that the Ealdorman was felt to be, in some way or other, less distant
from the mass of his people than the King was; the place of King could
be held only by one of the stock of Woden; the place of Ealdorman, it
would seem, was open to any man who showed that he possessed the gifts
which were needed in a leader of men.Kingship thus became the law of all the Teutonic tribes which settled
in Britain and whose union made up the English nation.That union, we
must always remember, was very gradual.Step by step, smaller Kings or
independent Ealdormen admitted the supremacy of a more powerful King.Then, in a second stage, the smaller state was absolutely incorporated
with the greater.Its ruler now, if he continued to rule at all, ruled
no longer as an independent or even as a vassal sovereign, but as a
mere magistrate, acting by the deputed authority of the sovereign of
whom he held his office(43).The settlement made by Cerdic and Cynric
on the southern coast grew, step by step, by the incorporation of many
small kingdoms and independent Ealdormanships, into the lordship of the
whole Isle of Britain, into the immediate kingship of all its English
inhabitants.The Ealdorman of a corner of Hampshire thus grew step by
step into the King of the West-Saxons, the King of the Saxons, the King
of the English, the Emperor of all Britain, the lord, in later times,
of a dominion reaching into every quarter of the world(44).But the
point which now concerns us is that, with each step in the growth of
the King’s territorial dominion, his political authority within that
dominion has grown also.The change from an Ealdorman to a King, the
change from a heathen King to a Christian King crowned and anointed,
doubtless did much to raise the power and dignity of the ruler who
thus at each change surrounded himself with new titles to reverence.The mere increase in the extent of territorial
dominion would at each step work most powerfully to increase the direct
power of the King, and still more powerfully to increase the vague
reverence which everywhere attaches to kingship.In Homer we read of
Kings, some of whom were “more kingly,” more of Kings, than others.A King who reigned over all Wessex was
more of a King than a King who reigned only over the Isle of Wight,
and a King who reigned over all England was more of a King than a
King who reigned only over Wessex(45).The greater the territory over
which a King reigns the less familiar he becomes to the mass of his
people; he is more and more shrouded in a mysterious awe, he is more
and more looked on as a being of a different nature from other men,
of a different nature even from other civil magistrates and military
leaders, however high their authority and however illustrious their
personal character.Such a separation of the King from the mass of his
people may indeed, in some states of things, lead, not to the increase,
but to the lessening of his practical power.He may become in popular
belief too great and awful for the effectual exercise of power, and, by
dint of his very greatness, his practical authority may be transferred
to his representatives who govern in his name.He may be surrounded
with a worship almost more than earthly, while the reality of power
passes to a Mayor of the Palace, or is split up among the satraps of
distant provinces(45).But, with a race of vigorous and politic Kings
ruling over a nation whose tendencies are to closer unity and not to
wider separation, each step in the territorial growth of the kingdom
is also a step in the growth, not only of the formal dignity, but of
the practical authority of the King.The King of the English, who in
the eleventh century held the direct sovereignty of all England, the
over-lordship of all Britain, was a very different person from his
forefather, who in the sixth century deemed that another victory over
the Briton, the acquisition of another strip of British territory,
another hundred, it may be, of modern Hampshire, had made him great
enough to change his title of Ealdorman for that of King.Such a King
was every inch a King; his personal character was of the highest moment
for the good or evil fortune of his kingdom.His will counted for much
in the making of the laws by which his people were to be governed, and
in the disposal of honours and offices among those who were to govern
under him.But yet he was not a despot; men never forgot that the
King was what his name implied, the representative, the impersonation,
the offspring of the people.It was from the choice of the people that
he received his authority to rule over them, a choice limited under
all ordinary circumstances to the royal house, but which, within that
house, was not tied down by a blind regard to any particular law of
succession.It was a choice which at any time could fix itself on the
worthiest man of the royal house, and which, when the royal house
failed to supply a fitting candidate, could boldly fix itself on the
worthiest man of the whole people(47).And those from whom the King
first drew his power ever shared with him in its exercise.The laws,
the grants, the appointments to offices, which the King made, needed
the assent of the people in their national Assembly, the gathering of
the Wise Men of the whole land(48).And those who gave him his power
and who guided him in its exercise could also, when need so called,
take away the power which they had given.At rare intervals—for it is
only at rare intervals that so great a step is likely to be taken—has
the English nation exercised its highest power by taking away the
Crown from Kings who were unworthy to wear it.I speak not of acts of
violence or murder, or of processes which, though clothed under legal
form, were without precedent in our history.I speak not of the secret
death of Henry the Sixth or of the open execution of Charles the First.I speak of the regular process of the Law.In Northumberland the right
of deposition was exercised with special frequency(49).But I will
speak only of that direct and unbroken line of Kings who from Kings of
the West-Saxons grew into the Kings of the English.Six times at least,
in the space of nine hundred years, from Sigeberht of Wessex to James
the Second, has the Great Council of the Nation thus put forth the
last and greatest of its powers(50).The last exercise of this power
has made its future exercise needless.All that in old times was to
be gained by the deposition of a King can now be gained by a vote of
censure on a Minister, or, in the extremest case, by his impeachment.But, besides that growth of the King’s power which followed naturally
on the growth of the King’s dominions, another cause was busily at
work which clothed him with a personal influence which was of almost
greater moment than his political authority.To a large portion of
his subjects, to all the men of special wealth or power, the King
gradually became, not only King but _lord_; his subjects gradually
became, not only his subjects but his _men_.These names may need some
explanation, and I will again go back to Tacitus as our starting-point.Side by side with the political community, the King, the nobles, the
popular Assembly, all of them strictly political powers, he describes
another institution, a relation in itself not political but purely
personal, but which gradually became of the highest political moment.This was the institution of the _comitatus_, the system of personal
relation between a man and his lord, a relation of faithful service on
one side, of faithful protection on the other.Let us again hear the
words of the great Roman interpreter of our own earliest days(51).“It is no shame among the Germans to be seen among the companions
(_comites_) of a chief.And there are degrees of rank in the
companionship (_comitatus_), according to the favour of him whom they
follow; and great is the rivalry among the companions which shall stand
highest in the favour of his chief, and also among the chiefs which
shall have the most and the most valiant companions.... When they come
to battle, it is shameful for the chief to be surpassed in valour; it
is shameful for his companions not to equal the valour of their chief.It is even a badge of disgrace for the remainder of life if a man comes
away alive from the field on which his chief has fallen.To guard, to
defend him, to assign their own valiant deeds to his credit, is their
first religious duty.The chiefs fight for victory; the companions
fight for their chief.”

This is the description given by a Roman historian of the second
century; let me set beside it the words of an English poet of the
tenth.He is describing the battle of Maldon in 991, which was fought
by the East-Saxons under their Ealdorman Brihtnoth against the invading
Northmen.The Ealdorman has been killed; two of his followers have
fled, one of them on the Ealdorman’s horse, and every word that is put
into the mouth of his faithful companions turns upon the personal tie
between them and their lord(52).“Thereon hewed him
   The heathen soldiers;
   And both the warriors
   That near him by-stood,
   Ælfnoth and Wulfmær both,
   Lay there on the ground
   By their lord;
   Their lives they sold.There bowed they from the fight
   That there to be would not;
   There were Odda’s bairns
   Erst in flight;
   Godric from battle went,
   And the good man forsook
   That to him ofttimes
   Horses had given.He leapt on the horse
   That his lord had owned,
   On the housings
   That it not right was.”

Presently we read of the deeds done by his Thegns over his body;

  “There was fallen
   The folk’s Elder,
   Æthelred’s Earl;
   All there saw
   Of his hearth’s comrades
   That their lord lay dead.Then there went forth
   The proud Thanes,
   The undaunted men
   Hastened gladly;
   They would there all
   One of two things,
   Either life forsake,
   Or the loved one wreak.”

Then one of the Thegns speaks;

  “Neither on that folk
   Shall the Thanes twit me
   That I from this host
   Away would go
   To seek my home,
   Now mine Elder lieth
   Hewn down in battle;
   To me is that harm most;
   He was both my kinsman
   And my lord.”

Then another speaks in answer;

  “How thou, Ælfwine, hast
   All our Thanes
   In need-time cheered.Now our lord lieth,
   The Earl on the earth,
   That of us each one
   Others should embolden,
   Warmen to the war,
   That while we weapons may
   Have and hold,
   The hard falchion,
   Spear and good sword.”

Then another speaks;

  “I this promise
   That I hence nill
   Flee a footstep,
   But will further go,
   To wreak in the fight
   My lord and comrade.Nor by Stourmere
   Any steadfast hero
   With words need twit me
   That I lordless
   Homeward should go,
   And wend from the fight.”

The story goes on a little later;

  “Rath was in battle
   Offa hewn down,
   Yet had he furthered
   That his lord had pledged,
   As he ere agreed
   With his ring-giver
   That they should both
   To the borough ride
   Hale to home,
   Or in the host cringe
   On the slaughter place,
   Of their wounds die.He lay thane-like
   His lord hard by.”

Lastly another Thegn speaks;

  “Mind shall the harder be,
   Heart shall the keener be,
   Mood shall the more be,
   As our main lessens.Here lies our Elder,
   All down hewn,
   A good man in the dust;
   Ever may he groan
   Who now from this war-play
   Of wending thinketh.I am old of life;
   Hence stir will I not,
   And I by the half
   Of my lord,
   By such a loved man
   To lie am thinking.”

This institution of military companionship seems to have struck Tacitus
with some amazement.He says that this kind of personal relation was
among the Germans not thought shameful.This was the natural feeling
of a Roman.The duty of a Roman citizen was wholly towards the state.The state might be represented either by a responsible magistrate or
by an irresponsible Emperor; in either case obedience was due to the
representative of the state; but there was no personal relation to
the man.The old Roman institution of patron and client, which was
so like the German _comitatus_, had pretty well died out by the time
of Tacitus, and it had at no time been entered into by men of high
rank(53).What amazed Tacitus was that among the Germans the noblest in
birth and exploits were not looked on as dishonoured by entering the
service of a personal lord.To Tacitus himself Trajan was the chief
magistrate of the Roman commonwealth, the chief commander of the Roman
army; he was a personal master to none but his slaves and freedmen(54).It was only in a much later stage of the Roman Empire that personal
service in the court and household of the Emperor began to be looked
on as honourable(55).But among the Teutonic nations the personal
relation coloured everything; personal service towards a King or other
chief was honourable from the beginning; the proudest nobles of Europe
have down to this day thought themselves honoured by filling offices
about the persons of Emperors, Kings, and other princes which Tacitus
would have deemed beneath the dignity of any Roman citizen.We are
now accustomed to see this kind of service paid in the case of royal
personages only; a few centuries back men of any rank deemed themselves
honoured by paying the like service to men of the rank next above their
own, or even to men of their own rank who had the start of them in age
and reputation.The knight was served by his esquire and the master
by his scholar; and the same principle, laid aside everywhere else,
lingers on in what is undoubtedly a trace of the Teutonic _comitatus_,
the fagging of our public schools.Now the political effect of the
existence of the principle of personal service, the institution of
the _comitatus_, alongside of the primitive political community, was
most important in our early history.The personal relation went far to
swallow up the purely political one.To enter the service of a chief
became so established a practice that at last it was deemed that it was
the part of every man to “seek a lord,” as the phrase was, to commend
himself, to put himself under the protection of some man more powerful
than himself(56).The _man_ owed faithful service to his _lord_; the
lord owed faithful protection to his man.The very word _Lord_, in its
older and fuller form _Hlaford_, implies the rewards which the lord
bestowed on his faithful man.The word is in some sort a puzzling one;
but there can be no doubt that it is connected with _hlaf_, _loaf_, and
that its general meaning is _the giver of bread_(57).Now herein lurks
something which has greatly affected all later political and social
arrangements.The institution of the _comitatus_ in its first state
had nothing whatever to do with the holding of land.But the _man_
looked for reward of his faithful service at the hands of his _lord_;
he looked for the bread of which his lord’s title proclaimed him as
the giver.There was of course no form of reward, no form of _bread_,
so convenient or so honourable as that of a grant of land to be held
as the reward of past and the condition of future service.Moreover
the custom of granting out lands to be held by the tenure of military
service had become common in the later days of Roman power(58).Such
lands were of course held, not of the Emperor as a personal lord, but
of the Roman Commonwealth of which he was the head and representative.But the custom of holding lands by military service fell in well with
the Teutonic institution of personal service, and the union of the two
in the same person produced that feudal relation which has had such
an important bearing on all political and social life through the
whole of the middle ages and down to our own time.The land granted
by the lord to his man, or the land which the man agreed to hold as
if it had been so granted, might be a kingdom held of the Emperor or
the Pope, or it might be the smallest estate held of a more powerful
neighbour.In either case, such a holding by military service was a
_fief_, and from the institution of such fiefs the so-called Feudal
System, with all its manifold workings for good and for evil, had its
rise.But so far as the Feudal System existed, either in England or in
any other country, it existed wholly as a system which had grown up by
the side of an earlier system which it wholly or partially displaced.The feudal tenant, holding his land of a lord by military service
gradually supplanted, wholly or partially, in most countries of Europe,
the _allodial_ holder who held his land of no other man, and who knew
no superior but God and the Law(59).In England this change took place
only gradually and partially; it was through the Norman Conquest, or,
more accurately, through the subtle legal theories which came in with
the Norman Conquest, that it was finally established.And, after all,
it was rather in theory than in fact that it was established.The
Feudal System, as something spreading into every corner of the land,
and affecting every relation of life, never obtained the same complete
establishment in England which it did in some continental countries.But it is only indirectly that my subject has anything to do with the
Feudal System, and especially with its social working.I have to do
with the _comitatus_, out of which the feudal relation grew, mainly in
another aspect equally indirect, namely, the way in which it affected
our earliest political institutions.It gave us a new form of nobility,
a nobility of office and of personal relation to the King, instead of
a nobility founded on birth only.It gave us a nobility of _Thegns_,
which gradually supplanted the earlier nobility of the _Eorls_.As the
royal power and dignity grew, it came to be looked on as the highest
honour to enter into the personal service of the King.Two results
followed; service towards the King, a place, that is, in the King’s
_comitatus_, became the badge and standard of nobility(60).And it
greatly strengthened the power of the King that he stood to all the
chief men of his kingdom in the relation, not only of a political
ruler, but of a personal lord, a lord to whose service they were bound
by a personal tie, and of whom they held their lands as the gift of
his personal bounty.It marks perhaps a decline from the first idea of
the _comitatus_ that the old word _Gesith_, _companion_, answering
exactly to the Latin _Comes_ used by Tacitus, was supplanted by the
name _Thegn_, literally _servant_(61).But when personal service was
deemed honourable, the name of servant was no degradation, and the
name _Thegn_ became equivalent to the older _Eorl_.The King’s Thegn,
the men who held their land of the King and who were bound to him by
the tie of personal service, formed the highest class of nobility.The
Thegns of inferior lords, of Bishops and Ealdormen, formed a secondary
class.A nobility of this kind, there can be no doubt, was so far more
liberal than the elder nobility of birth that admission to it was not
forbidden to men of lower degree.The _Ceorl_, the ordinary freeman,
could not in strictness become an _Eorl_, for the simple reason that
he could not change his forefathers; but he might, and he often did,
become a _Thegn_(62).But, on the other hand, such a nobility, while
it made it easier for the common freeman to rise, tended to lower the
condition of the common freemen who did not rise.For the very reason
that the barrier of birth is one which cannot be passed, it is in
some respects less irksome than the barrier of wealth or office.The
privileges of a strictly hereditary nobility are much more likely to
sink into mere honorary distinctions than the privileges of a nobility
whose rank is backed by the solid advantages of office and of a
personal relation to the sovereign.The tendency then of the first six hundred years after the settlement
of the English in Britain was to increase the power of the Crown, to
depress the lower class of freemen, to exchange a nobility of birth for
a nobility of personal service to the King.That is to say, England
had, before the Norman Conquest, already begun to walk, though with
less speed than most other nations, in the path which led to the
general overthrow of liberty throughout Europe.The foreign invasion
which for a moment seemed to have crushed her freedom for ever did in
truth only lead to its new birth, to its fresh establishment in forms
better fitted to the altered state of things, forms better fitted
to be handed on to later times, forms better fitted to preserve the
well-being of a great nation, than those forms of the old Teutonic
community which still linger on in those remote corners of the world
which I spoke of at my beginning.That momentary overthrow, that
lasting new birth, will be the subject of my second chapter.I will
now only call you to bear in mind that England has never been left
at any time without a National Assembly of some kind or other.Be it
Witenagemót, Great Council, or Parliament, there has always been some
body of men claiming, with more or less of right, to speak in the name
of the nation.And bear too in mind that, down to the Norman Conquest,
the body which claimed to speak in the name of the nation was, in legal
theory at least, the nation itself.This is a point on which I mean
again to speak more fully; I would now simply suggest the thought, new
perhaps to many, that there was a time when every freeman of England,
no less than every freeman of Uri, could claim a direct voice in the
councils of his country.There was a time when every freeman of England
could raise his voice or clash his weapon in the Assembly which chose
Bishops and Ealdormen and Kings, when he could boast that the laws
which he obeyed were laws of his own making, and that the men who bore
rule over him were rulers of his own choosing.Those days are gone, nor
need we seek to call them back.The struggles of ages on the field and
in the Senate have again won back for us the selfsame rights in forms
better suited to our times than the barbaric freedom of our fathers.Yet it is well that we should look back to the source whence comes all
that we boast of as our own possession, all that we have handed on to
our daughter commonwealths in other continents.Let us praise famous
men and our fathers that begat us.Let us look to the rock whence we
were hewn and to the hole of the pit whence we were digged.Freedom,
the old poet says, is a noble thing(63); it is also an ancient thing.And those who love it now in its more modern garb need never shrink
from tracing back its earlier forms to the first days when history has
aught to tell us of the oldest life of our fathers and our brethren.In my first chapter I dealt mainly with those political institutions of
the earliest times—institutions common to our whole race, institutions
which still live on untouched among some small primitive communities of
our race—out of which the still living Constitution of England grew.It is now my business, as the second part of my subject, to trace the
steps by which that Constitution grew out of a political state with
which at first sight it seems to have so little in common.My chief
point is that it did thus, in the strictest sense, grow out of that
state.Our English Constitution was never made, in the sense in which
the Constitutions of many other countries have been made.There never
was any moment when Englishmen drew out their political system in the
shape of a formal document, whether as the carrying out of any abstract
political theories or as the imitation of the past or present system of
any other nation.There are indeed certain great political documents,
each of which forms a landmark in our political history.There is the
Great Charter, the Petition of Right, the Bill of Rights.But not one
of these gave itself out as the enactment of anything new.All claimed
to set forth, with new strength, it might be, and with new clearness,
those rights of Englishmen which were already old.In all our great
political struggles the voice of Englishmen has never called for the
assertion of new principles, for the enactment of new laws; the cry has
always been for the better observance of the laws which were already
in force, for the redress of grievances which had arisen from their
corruption or neglect(1).Till the Great Charter was wrung from John,
men called for the laws of good King Eadward.And when the tyrant had
unwillingly set his seal to the groundwork of all our later Law, men
called for the stricter observance of a Charter which was deemed to
be itself only the laws of Eadward in a newer dress(2).We have made
changes from time to time; but they have been changes which have been
at once conservative and progressive—conservative because progressive,
progressive because conservative.They have been the application of
ancient principles to new circumstances; they have been the careful
repairs of an old building, not the pulling down of an old building
and the rearing up of a new.The life and soul of English law has ever
been precedent; we have always held that whatever our fathers once did
their sons have a right to do again.When the Estates of the Realm
declared the throne of James the Second to be vacant, they did not seek
to justify the act by any theories of the right of resistance, or by
any doctrines of the rights of man.It was enough that, three hundred
years before, the Estates of the Realm had declared the throne of
Richard the Second to be vacant(3).By thus walking in the old paths,
by thus hearkening to the wisdom of our forefathers, we have been able
to change whenever change has been needed, and we have been kept back
from changing out of the mere love of abstract theory.We have thus
been able to advance, if somewhat slowly, yet the more surely; and when
we have made a false step, we have been able to retrace it.On this
last power, the power of undoing whatever has been done amiss, I wish
specially to insist.In tracing the steps by which our Constitution
has grown into its present shape, I shall try specially to show in how
many cases the best acts of modern legislation have been, wittingly or
unwittingly, a falling back on the principles of our earliest times.In my first chapter I tried to show how our fathers brought with
them into the Isle of Britain those primæval institutions which were
common to them with the whole Teutonic race.I tried to show how those
institutions were modified in the course of time by the circumstances
of the English Conquest of Britain, and by the events which followed
that Conquest.I showed how the kingly power grew with every increase
of the territorial extent of the kingdom; how the old nobility of birth
gave way to a new nobility of personal relation to the sovereign; and
how the effect of these changes seems to have been to make it easier
for the individual freeman of the lower rank to rise, but at the same
time to lower the position of the ordinary freemen as a class.This
last change was still more largely brought about as an independent
result of the same changes which tended to increase the kingly power.In a state of things where representation is unknown, where every
freeman is an elector and a lawgiver, but where, if he exercises his
elective and legislative rights, he must exercise them directly in
his own person—in such a state of things as this every increase of
the national territory makes those rights of less practical value,
and causes the actual powers of government to be shut up in the hands
of a smaller body.There is no doubt that in the earliest Teutonic
assemblies every freeman had his place.There is no doubt that in
England every freeman kept his place in the smaller local assemblies of
the _mark_, the _hundred_, and the _shire_(4).He still, where modern
legislation has not wholly swept it away, keeps, as I hinted in my
former lecture, some faint shadow of the old right when he gives a vote
in the assembly, in which the assembly of the mark still lives on, that
is, in the vestry of his parish.But how as to the great assembly of
all, the Assembly of the Wise, the Witenagemót of the whole realm?No
ancient record gives us any clear or formal account of the constitution
of that body.It is commonly spoken of in a vague way as a gathering of
the wise, the noble, the great men(5).But, alongside of passages like
these, we find other passages which speak of it in a way which implies
a far more popular constitution.King Eadward is said to be chosen King
by “all folk.” Earl Godwine “makes his speech before the King and all
the people of the land.” Judicial sentences and other acts of authority
are voted by the army, that is by the people under arms.Sometimes we
find direct mention of the presence of large and popular classes of
men, as the citizens of London or Winchester(6).The right of the ordinary freeman to attend, to
vote—it might perhaps be nearer the truth to say to shout(7)—in the
general Assembly of the whole realm was never formally taken away.But
it was a right which, in its own nature, most men could hardly ever
exercise.None but men of wealth would have the means, none but men
of some personal importance would have any temptation, to take long
journeys for such a purpose.It is not likely that any great multitude
would, under ordinary circumstances, set off from Northern England to
attend meetings which were habitually held at Westminster, Winchester,
and Gloucester.It is plain that the habitual attendance would not go
beyond a small body of chief men, Earls, Bishops, Abbots, the officers
of the King’s court, the Thegns of the greatest wealth or the highest
personal influence.But it is plain that, when the heart of the nation
was specially stirred by some overwhelming interest, many men would
find their way to the Assembly who would not find their way to it
in ordinary times.And, when the Assembly was held in a town, the
citizens of that town at once formed a popular element ready on the
spot.Hence we can account for the seemingly contradictory way in which
the Assembly is spoken of, sometimes in language which would imply
an aristocratic body, sometimes in language which would imply a body
highly democratic.It was in fact a body, democratic in ancient theory,
aristocratic in ordinary practice, but to which any strong popular
impulse could at any time restore its ancient democratic character(8).Acts done by a freely chosen representative body may, without much
straining of language, be said to be done by the whole people.But
acts done by a body not representative could never be called the acts
of the whole people, unless the whole people had an acknowledged right
to attend its meetings, though that right might, under all ordinary
circumstances, be exercised only by a few of their number.Out of this body, whose constitution, by the time of the Norman
Conquest, had become not a little anomalous and not a little
fluctuating, our Parliament directly grew.Of one House of that
Parliament we may say more; we may say, not that it grew out of the
ancient Assembly but that it is absolutely the same by personal
identity.The House of Lords not only springs out of, it actually is,
the ancient Witenagemót.King
William summoned his Witan as King Eadward had summoned them before
him.In one memorable assembly of the Conqueror’s reign, we read that
the great men of the realm were reinforced by the presence of the
whole body of the landholders of England, whose number tradition handed
down as sixty thousand(9).But, as a rule, the Great Councils after
the Norman Conquest bear the same uncertain and fluctuating character
as the Gemóts of earlier days.In the constitution of the House of
Lords I can see nothing mysterious or wonderful.Its hereditary
character came in, like other things, step by step, by accident rather
than by design.And it should not be forgotten that, as long as the
Bishops keep their seats in the House, the hereditary character of the
House does not extend to all its members.To me it seems simply that
two classes of men, the two highest classes, the Earls and the Bishops,
never lost or disused that right of attending in the National Assembly
which was at first common to them with all other freemen.Besides these
two classes, the King summoned other men to our early Parliaments,
pretty much, it would seem, at his own pleasure.The right of the
King so to do could not be denied; when all had an abstract right to
attend, we cannot blame the King for specially summoning those for
whose attendance he specially wished.But it would almost naturally
follow that such a special summons would gradually be held to bestow an
exclusive right, and that those who were not specially summoned would
soon be looked upon as having no part or lot in the matter.But it is
certain that it was long before such a summons was held to confer a
hereditary, or even a lasting personal right.The King did not always
summon the same men to every Parliament.Besides the Earls and the
Bishops, others both of the laity and the clergy were always summoned,
but the list of those who were summoned, both of the laity and of the
lesser ecclesiastical dignitaries, constantly varies from Parliament
to Parliament(10).That the personal summons conveyed an exclusive
hereditary right was one of those devices of lawyers of which so many
have crept into our constitution.When the notion of hereditary right
had once established itself, the formal creation of peerages by patent
was a natural stage.Looking at the matter from this historical point
of view, it seems to me simply wonderful how any one can doubt the
power of the Crown to create life-peerages, or to regulate the tenure
or succession of a peerage in any way that it thinks good.The House of Lords then, I do not hesitate to say, represents, or
rather is, the ancient Witenagemót.An assembly in which at first every
freeman had a right to appear has, by the force of circumstances, step
by step, without any one moment of sudden change, shrunk up into an
Assembly wholly hereditary and official, an Assembly to which the Crown
may summon any man, but to which, it is now strangely held, the Crown
cannot refuse to summon the representatives of any man whom it has
once summoned.As in most other things, the tendency to shrink up into
a body of this kind began to show itself before the Norman Conquest,
and was finally confirmed and established through the results of the
Norman Conquest.But the special function of the body into which the
old national Assembly has changed, the function of “another House,” an
Upper House, a House of Lords as opposed to a House of Commons, could
not show itself till a second House of a more popular constitution
had arisen by its side.Like everything else in our English polity,
both Houses in some sort came of themselves.Neither of them was the
creation of any ingenious theorist, though we need not doubt that many
of the several steps in the growth of each were, each in its own time,
the work of practical statesmanship.Our forefathers had no theories;
but men, each in his own generation, had eyes keen enough to see that
such and such a change in detail would get rid of such and such an
immediate evil, or would bring with it such and such an immediate
advantage.Nay more, it has sometimes happened that a change which
was brought in with an evil intent has in the end worked for good.Measures which were taken with a view of strengthening the power of
the Crown have come in the end to widen the rights of the people.On
the other hand, institutions which once answered a good and needful
purpose have sometimes, through change of times, changed their nature
and have become instruments of evil instead of good.But in neither
case were the institutions of our fathers the work of abstract theory.They have therefore lived on, and they have borne good fruit.Our
national Assembly has changed its name and its constitution, but
its corporate identity has lived on unbroken.We can therefore at
any moment reform without destroying.In France, on the other hand,
institutions have been the work of abstract theory; they have been the
creations, for good or for evil, of the minds of individual men.The
English Parliament is immemorial; it grew step by step out of the older
order of things.In France the older order of things utterly vanished;
the ground lay open for the creation of a wholly new institution, and
the States-General were called into being at the bidding of Philip the
Fair(11).Englishmen in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries had no
theories of the rights of man or of universal humanity.But when they
saw a practical grievance, they called for its redress.Frenchmen in
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries had theories as magnificent as
any that have been put forth in the eighteenth or the nineteenth.And
they had even then already learned to do deeds of blood in the name
of freedom and philanthropy(12).The States-General lived but a fitful life from century
to century, and they perished for ever in the Great Revolution.Since
that time no French institution, no form either of the legislative or
of the executive power, has been able to keep up a continuous being of
twenty years.This difference has not been owing to any lack of great
men or of noble purposes on the part of our continental neighbours.It
has been owing, partly, we may believe, to differences in the inborn
character of the two nations, partly to differences in the course
taken by their several histories.In France the Kings gradually swept
away all traces of older free institutions, and established a simple
despotism in the Crown(13).The French therefore have been left
without any traditional foundation to build on.In all their changes
for good or for evil they have been driven to build afresh from the
beginning.Our Kings never wholly wiped out our free institutions;
they found means to turn them to their own purposes, and to establish
a practical despotism without destroying the outward forms of freedom.The forms thus lived on, and in better times they could again be
clothed with their substance.We ever had traditional principles to
fall back upon, a traditional basis to build upon.It would be hard to
reckon up the number of Assemblies, Conventions, Chambers of Deputies,
and Legislative Bodies, which have risen and fallen in France, while
the House of Lords and the House of Commons have lived on, with their
powers, their duties, their relations to the Crown, to the Nation, and
to one another, ever silently changing, but with their continuous being
remaining throughout unbroken.But I would again point out that, while the growth of English
institutions has thus gone on almost in obedience to a natural law, the
wisdom, the foresight, the patriotism, of individual statesmen is never
to be put out of our reckoning.There was a given state of things, and
some man had keenness of sight to see what was the right thing to do
in that state of things.Our Constitution has no founder; but there is
one man to whom we may give all but honours of a founder, one man to
whose wisdom and self-devotion we owe that English history has taken
the course which it has taken for the last six hundred years.It might
no doubt have taken that course without him; things might have come
about as they did without any one man coming so prominently to the
front; or, if he had not arisen, some other man might have arisen to do
his work.But we need not speculate as to what might have been; it is
enough that one man did arise to do the work, that there is one man to
whom we owe that the wonderful thirteenth century, the great creative
and destructive age throughout the world(14), was to us an age of
creation and not of destruction.That man, the man who finally gave to
English freedom its second and more lasting shape, the hero and martyr
of England in the greatest of her constitutional struggles, was Simon
of Montfort, Earl of Leicester.If we may not call him the founder of
the English Constitution, we may at least call him the founder of the
House of Commons(15).It was in his age that the new birth of English
freedom began to show itself; it was mainly by his work that that new
birth was not stifled before it had brought forth lasting fruits.Strange it may at first sight seem that the founder of the later
liberties of England was not an Englishman.Simon of Montfort, a native
of France, did for the land of his adoption what even he might not
have been able to do for the land of his birth.The land of
his birth was—shall I say flourishing or suffering?—under the baleful
virtues of the most righteous of Kings.Saint Lewis reigned in France,
Saint Lewis the just and holy, the man who never swerved from the path
of right, the man who swared to his neighbour and disappointed him not,
though it were to his own hindrance.Under his righteous rule there
could be no ground for revolt or disaffection.By surrounding the Crown
with the reflected glory of his own virtues, he did more than any other
man to strengthen its power.He thus did more than any other man to
pave the way for that foul despotism of his successors whose evil deeds
would have daily vexed his righteous soul.In England, on the other
hand, we had the momentary curse, the lasting blessing, of a succession
of evil Kings.We had Kings who had no spark of English feeling in
their breasts, but from whose follies and necessities our fathers were
able to wring their freedom, all the more lastingly because it was bit
by bit that it was wrung.A Latin poet once sang that freedom never
flourishes more brightly than it does under a righteous King(16).And
so it does while that righteous King himself tarries among men.But
to win freedom as an heritage for ever there are times when we have
more need of the vices of Kings than of their virtues.The tyranny of
our Angevin masters woke up English freedom from its momentary grave.Had Richard and John and Henry been Kings like Ælfred and Saint Lewis,
the crosier of Stephen Langton, the sword of Robert Fitzwalter, would
never have flashed at the head of the Barons and people of England; the
heights of Lewes would never have seen the mightiest triumph of her
freedom; the pavement of Evesham choir would never have closed over the
mangled relics of her noblest champion(17).The career of Simon of Montfort is the most glorious in our later
history.Cold must be the heart of every Englishman who does not feel
a thrill of reverence and gratitude as he utters that immortal name.But, fully to understand his work, we must go back somewhat before his
own time, we must go back and trace how the sway of foreign invaders
first made the path ready for the course of the foreign deliverer.I
have shown in what state our Constitution stood at the time of the
Norman Conquest.In that Constitution, be it ever remembered, the
Norman Conquest made no formal change whatever.Nothing has had a more
lasting effect on all later English history than the personal character
and position of the Norman Conqueror.But it was not in the character
of a legislator that the main work of William was done.His greatest
work of all was to weld together the still imperfectly united kingdoms
of our ancient England into one indivisible body, a body which, since
his day, no man has ever dreamed of rending asunder.But this was not
the work of any formal legislative enactment; it was the silent result
of the compression of foreign conquest.So it was with William’s whole
policy and position.He was in truth a Conqueror, King by the edge of
the sword, but it was his aim in everything to disguise the fact.He
claimed the Crown by legal right; he received it by the formal election
of the English people, and he was consecrated to his kingly office by
the hands of an English Primate.He professed to rule, not according
to his own will, not according to any laws of his own devising, but
according to the laws of his predecessor and kinsman King Eadward
(18).The great immediate change which was wrought under him was not
any formal legislative change; it was the silent revolution implied in
the transfer—the wary and gradual transfer—of all the greatest estates
and highest offices in England to the hands of foreign holders.The
momentary effect was to make Englishmen on their own soil the subjects
of foreign conquerors.The lasting effect was to change those foreign
conquerors into Englishmen, and to call forth the spirit of English
freedom in a more definite and antagonistic shape than it had ever
before put on.What was the real position of a landowner of Norman
descent within a generation or two after the Conquest?He held English
lands according to English law; in all but the highest rank he lived
on equal terms with other landowners of English birth; he was himself
born on English soil, often of an English mother; he was called on
in endless ways to learn, to obey, and to administer, the laws of
England.Such a man soon became in feeling, and before long in speech
also, as good an Englishman as if he had come of the male line of
Hengest or Cerdic.There was nothing to hinder even one of the actual
conquerors from thoroughly throwing in his lot with his new country
and with its people.His tongue was French, but in truth he had far
more in common with the Englishman than with the Frenchman.He was
but a near kinsman slightly disguised.The Norman was a Dane who, in
his sojourn in Gaul, had put on a slight French varnish, and who came
into England to be washed clean again.The blood of the true Normans,
in the real Norman districts of Bayeux and Coutances, differs hardly
at all from the blood of the inhabitants of the North and East of
England(19).See a French soldier and a Norman farmer side by side,
and you feel at once that the Norman is nothing but a long-parted
kinsman.The general effect of him is that of a man of Yorkshire or
Lincolnshire who has somehow picked up a bad habit of talking French.We have the distinct assertions
of contemporary writers, and every incidental notice bears out their
assertions, that, among all classes between the highest and the lowest,
among all between the great noble and the villain, the distinction of
Norman and Englishman had been forgotten within little more than a
hundred years after the time when King William came into England(20).And presently other causes came to make all the sons of the soil draw
nearer and nearer together.A new dynasty filled the throne, a dynasty
which claimed by female descent to be at once Norman and English, but
which, in origin and feeling, was neither Norman nor English(21).Henry the Second, Count of Anjou through his father, Duke of Aquitaine
through his wife, inherited also his mother’s claims on Normandy and
England, but under him Normandy and England alike were but parts of a
vast dominion which stretched from the Orkneys to the Pyrenees.Under
the mighty, and on the whole the righteous, sway of the great Henry
the worst side of this state of things did not show itself(22).Under
his sons and his grandson England felt to the full the bitterness and
the blessings of the Conquest.The land was overrun by utter strangers;
the men of Old-English birth and the descendants of the first Norman
settlers both saw the natives of other lands placed over the heads of
both alike.Places of trust and honour and wealth were handed over to
foreign favourites, and every man in the land was exposed to a yet
heavier scourge, to the violence and insolence of foreign mercenaries.Under John Normandy was lost(23), and England again became the chief
possession of the King of England.But neither John nor Henry learned
the lesson.The personal vices of the father, the personal virtues of
the son, worked to the same end as far as their kingdom was concerned.The King whose wickedness became a proverb, who surrounded himself
with the kindred ruffians of every nation, and the King whose chief
fault was that he could never say No to his wife or his mother, helped
alike to call forth the spirit of resistance, to draw all Englishmen of
whatever origin nearer together, and thereby to work out the great work
of giving England a free and lasting Constitution.For such Kings we
may well be thankful, but to such Kings we owe no thanks.Our feelings
of personal thankfulness towards any of our later Kings begin only when
a King arose who joined the political skill of Henry the Second to the
personal virtues of Henry the Third, and who added to both a feeling
of English patriotism, a ruling sense of right in public affairs, of
which neither Henry ever felt the slightest spark in his bosom.Edward
the First, the first of our later Kings who bore an English name and an
English heart, was the first round whose name can gather any feelings
of personal thankfulness.In him we see the first of our Kings of
foreign blood who did aught for the growth of our constitutional rights
in some other way than that of calling forth the spirit of resistance
to his rule.Thus it was that the misgovernment of our Angevin Kings called forth
among all the natives of the land an universal spirit of revolt against
the domination of strangers within the realm.And they called forth the
spirit of revolt in another way, a way hardly less important, by their
base subserviency to a foreign power in ecclesiastical matters.I have
here nothing to do with theological dogmas, with their truth or their
falsehood, but the ecclesiastical position of the nation forms a most
important aspect of its history throughout these times.In Old-English
times there can be no doubt as to the existence of an effective
supremacy in ecclesiastical matters on the part of the Crown.The King
was the Supreme Governor of the Church, because he was the Supreme
Governor of the Nation.The Church and the Nation were absolutely the
same; the King and his Witan dealt with ecclesiastical questions and
disposed of ecclesiastical offices by the same right by which they
dealt with temporal questions and disposed of temporal offices(24).The Bishop and the Ealdorman, each appointed by the same authority,
presided jointly in the assembly of the shire, and the assembly over
which they presided dealt freely both with ecclesiastical and with
temporal causes.One of the few formal changes in our Law which took
place in the days of the Conqueror was the separation of the two
jurisdictions of the Bishop and the Ealdorman.One of William’s extant
laws ordained the establishment, according to continental models, of
distinct ecclesiastical courts for the trial of ecclesiastical causes
(25).But more important than this formal change was the practical
result of the Conquest in bringing England into closer connexion than
before with the See of Rome.The enterprise of the Conqueror was
approved by Hildebrand, and it was blessed by the Pope in whose name
Hildebrand already ruled(26).While William lived, the royal supremacy
remained untouched, and, allowing for his position in a conquered
land, we may fairly say that it was not abused.But in meaner hands
the ancient power of the Crown as the representative of the nation was
often abused and often disputed.Quarrels arose as to the limits of
the ecclesiastical and the civil power such as had never been heard of
in the old times.And we must remember that claims which seem utterly
monstrous now were far from seeming monstrous in a state of things so
wholly unlike our times.Even the claim of the clergy to an exemption
from temporal jurisdiction in criminal cases had a very different look
then from what it has now.The privilege thus claimed was by no means
confined to the priesthood; it took in a large part of those among
the people who were least able to defend themselves(27).And when we
think of the horrible punishments, death, and mutilations worse than
death, which the courts of our Angevin Kings freely inflicted for very
slight offences, we can understand that men looked favourably on the
courts of the Bishops, where the heaviest penalties were stripes and
imprisonment.In the disputes between the Crown and the Church, from
William Rufus to Henry the Second, we find popular feeling always
enlisted on the ecclesiastical side(28).Nor need we wonder at this,
when we find among the Constitutions of Clarendon, which King Henry
strove to enforce and which Archbishop Thomas withstood, one which
forbad the ordination of villains without the consent of their lords.That is to say, it cut off from the lowest class the only path by which
they had any hope of rising to posts of honour and authority(29).But
from the reign of John onwards we get a new state of things.A foreign
power stepped in, a power which had as yet meddled but little in the
strictly internal affairs of England, and which, so far as it had
meddled at all, had on the whole taken the popular side.In the latter
days of John and through the whole reign of Henry the Third, we find
the Pope and the King in strict alliance against the English Church
and Nation.The last good deed done by a Pope towards England was when
Innocent the Third sent us Stephen Langton(30).Ever afterwards we
find Pope and King leagued together to back up each other’s oppressions
and exactions.The Papal power was always ready to step in on behalf
of the Crown, always ready to hurl spiritual censures against the
champions of English freedom.The Great Charter was denounced at
Rome; so was its author the patriot Primate(31).Earl Simon died
excommunicate; but, in the belief of Englishmen, the excommunications
of Rome could not hinder an English Earl from working countless signs
and wonders(32)—a pretty convincing argument, one might deem, that the
Bishop of Rome had no jurisdiction in this realm of England.Against
King and Pope the whole nation stood united; clergy and laity, nobles
and commons, men of Norman and men of Old-English birth, all stood
together alike against the King’s foreign favourites and against the
aggressions of Rome.The historians of the age, all of them churchmen,
most of them monks, are all but unanimous on the popular side.Prelates
like the Primate Stephen, like Robert Grosseteste of Lincoln and
Walter of Cantelupe of Worcester, were foremost in the good cause;
the two latter were among the closest friends and counsellors of the
patriot Earl(33).We see how old distinctions and old enmities had
been wiped out, how all the sons of the soil were banded together in
one fellowship, when we read the letter denouncing the abuses of the
Roman See which was sent to that See in the name of no less a body
than the whole Nobility, Clergy, and Commons of the English realm.In that letter, an out-spoken and truly English document, which has
been preserved by an historian who well appreciated it, the writers
set forth that, as the Nobles, Clergy, and Commons in whose name it
is written have no common seal, they have, for the signature of their
document, borrowed the seal of the city of London(34).This last fact brings me round to what I first spoke of long ago,
what I may perhaps seem to have forgotten, but what I have in truth
had constantly before my eyes, the distinctly constitutional reforms
which we owe to Earl Simon of Montfort.The fact that a document
which professed to speak in the name of all classes of the whole
nation could not be so fittingly signed as with the seal of the city
of London marks the place which that city held in the political
estimation of the time.But London held that position only as the
greatest member of an advancing class, as the foremost among the
cities and boroughs of England.Now the great work of Earl Simon was
to give those cities and boroughs their distinct place as one of the
elements of the body politic.Let us trace the steps by which that
great work was done.When we reach the thirteenth century, we may look
on the old Teutonic constitution as having utterly passed away.Some
faint traces of it indeed we may find here and there in the course
of the twelfth century, as when both sides in the wars of Stephen and
Matilda acknowledged the right of the citizens of London to a voice
in the disposal of the Crown(35).But the regular Great Council, the
lineal representatives of the ancient _Mycel Gemôt_ or _Witenagemôt_,
was shrinking up into a body not very unlike our House of Lords.Its
constitution, as I have already hinted, was far more fluctuating, far
less strictly hereditary, than the modern body, but it was almost as
far from being in any sense a representation of the people.The Great
Charter secures the rights of the nation and of the national Assembly
as against arbitrary legislation and arbitrary taxation on the part of
the Crown.But it makes no change in the constitution of the Assembly
itself.The greater Barons were to be summoned personally; the lesser
tenants in chief, the representatives of the _landsittende menn_ of
Domesday, were to be summoned by a general writ(36).The Great Charter
in short is a Bill of Rights; it is not what, in modern phrase, we
understand by a Reform Bill.But, during the reigns of John and Henry
the Third, a popular element was fast making its way into the national
Councils in a more practical form.The right of the ordinary freeman
to attend in person had long been a shadow; that of the ordinary
tenant-in-chief was becoming hardly more practical; it now begins to be
exchanged for what had by this time become the more practical right of
choosing representatives to act in his name.Like all other things in
England, this right has grown up by degrees and as the result of what
we might almost call a series of happy accidents.Both in the reign
of John and in the former part of the reign of Henry, we find several
instances of knights from each county being summoned(37).Here we
have the beginning of our county members and of the title which they
still bear, of knights of the shire.Here is the beginning of popular
representation, as distinct from the gathering of the people in their
own persons; but we need not think that those who first summoned them
had any conscious theories of popular representation.The earliest
object for which they were called together was probably a fiscal
one; it was a safe and convenient way of getting money.The notion
of summoning a small number of men to act on behalf of the whole was
doubtless borrowed from the practice in judicial proceedings and in
inquests and commissions of various kinds, in which it was usual for
certain select men to swear on behalf of the whole shire or hundred.We must not forget, though it is a matter on which I have no time to
insist here, that our judicial and our parliamentary institutions are
closely connected, that both sprang out of the primitive Assemblies,
that things which now seem so unlike as our popular juries and the
judicial powers of the House of Lords are in truth both of them
fragments of the judicial powers which Tacitus speaks of as being
vested in those primitive Assemblies.It was only step by step that the
functions of judge, juror, witness, and legislator became the utterly
distinct functions which they are now(38).Thus we find the beginnings of the House of Commons, as we might have
expected, in that class of its members which, for the most part, has
most in common with the already established House of Lords.Thus
far the developement of the Constitution had gone on in its usual
incidental way.Each step in advance, however slight, was doubtless
the work of the discernment of some particular man, even though his
views may not have gone beyond the compassing of some momentary
advantage.But now we come to that great change, that great measure of
Parliamentary Reform, which has left to all later reformers nothing
to do but to improve in detail.We come to that great act of the
patriot Earl which made our popular Chamber really a popular Chamber.A House of knights, of county members, would have been comparatively
an aristocratic body; it would have left out one of the most healthy
and vigorous, and by far the most progressive, element in the nation.When, after the fight of Lewes, Earl Simon, then master of the kingdom
with the King in his safe keeping, summoned his famous Parliament, he
summoned, not only two knights from every county, but also two citizens
from every city and two burgesses from every borough(39).The Earl had
long known the importance and value of the growing civic element in the
political society of his age.When, in an earlier stage of his career,
he held the government of Gascony, he had, on his return to England, to
answer charges brought against him by the Archbishop of Bourdeaux and
the nobles of the province.The Earl’s answer was to bring forward a
writing, giving him the best of characters, which was signed with the
common seal of the city of Bourdeaux(40).As it was in Gascony, so it
was in England.The Earl was always a reformer, one who set himself
to redress practical grievances, to withstand the royal favourites,
to put a check on the oppressions of Pope and King.But his first
steps in the way of reform were made wholly on an aristocratic basis.He tried to redress the grievances of the nation by the help of his
fellow nobles only.Step by step he learned that no true reform could
be wrought for so narrow a platform, and step by step he took into his
confidence, first the knights of the counties, and lastly the class to
whose good will he had owed so much in his earlier trial, the citizens
and burgesses.Through the whole struggle they stood steadily by him;
London was as firm in his cause as Bourdeaux had been, and its citizens
fought and suffered and triumphed with him on the glorious day of
Lewes(41).By a bold and happy innovation, he called a class which had
done so much for him and for the common cause to take their place in
the councils of the nation.It was in Earl Simon’s Parliament of 1265
that the still abiding elements of the popular chamber, the Knights,
Citizens, and Burgesses, first appeared side by side.Thus was formed
that newly developed Estate of the Realm which was, step by step, to
grow into the most powerful of all, the Commons’ House of Parliament.Such was the gift which England received from her noblest champion
and martyr.Nor should it sound strange in our ears that her champion
and martyr was by birth a stranger.We boast ourselves that we have
led captive our conquerors, and that we have made them into sons of
the soil as faithful as ourselves.What we have done with conquerors
we have also done with peaceful settlers.In after days we welcomed
every victim of oppression and persecution, the Fleming, the Huguenot,
and the Palatine.And what we welcomed we adopted and assimilated,
and strengthened our English being with all that was worthiest in
foreign lands.So can we honour, along with the men of English birth,
those men of other lands who have done for England as sons for their
own mother.Sandra moved to the office.The Danish Cnut ranks alongside of the worthiest of our
native Kings.Anselm of Aosta ranks alongside of the worthiest of our
native Prelates.And so alongside of the worthiest of our native Earls
we place the glorious name of Simon the Righteous.A stranger, but a
stranger who came to our shores to claim lands and honours which were
his lawful heritage, he became our leader against strangers of another
mould, against the adventurers who thronged the court of a King who
turned his back on his own people.The first noble of England, the
brother-in-law of the King, he threw in his lot, not with princes
or nobles, but with the whole people.He was the chosen leader of
England in his life, and in death he was worshipped as her martyr.In
those days religion coloured every feeling; the patriot who stood up
for right and freedom was honoured alongside of him who suffered for
his faith.We fill our streets and market-places with the statues of
worthies of later days; Peel and Herbert and Lewis and Cobden yet live
among us in bronze or marble.In those days honour to the statesman
was not well distinguished from worship to the saint, and Waltheof
and Simon and Thomas of Lancaster(42) were hailed as sainted patrons
of England, and wonders were held to be wrought by their relics or at
their tombs.The poets of three languages vied in singing the praises
of the man who strove and suffered for right, and Simon, the guardian
of England on the field and in the senate, was held to be her truer
guardian still in the heavenly places from which our fathers deemed
that the curse of Rome had no power to shut him out(43).The great work of the martyred Earl had a strange destiny.His personal
career was cut short, his political work was brought to perfection, by
a rival and a kinsman only less to be honoured than himself.On the
field of Evesham Simon died and Edward triumphed.But it was on Edward
that Simon’s mantle fell; it was to his destroyer that he handed on the
torch which fell from his dying grasp.For a moment his work seemed
to have died with him; for some years Parliaments were still summoned
which were not after the model of the great Assembly which answered
to the writs of the captive Henry.But the model still lived in men’s
hearts, and presently the wisdom of the great Edward saw that his
uncle’s gift could no longer be denied to his people.Parliaments after
Simon’s model have been called together in unbroken succession from
Edward’s day to our own(44).Next to the name of Simon we may honour
the name of Edward himself and the names of the worthies who withstood
him.To Roger Bigod of Norfolk and Humfrey Bohun of Hereford we owe the
crowning of the work(45).The Parliament of England was now wrought
into the fulness of its perfect form, and the most homely, but not the
least important, of its powers was now fully acknowledged.No tax or
gift could the King of England claim at the hands of Englishmen save
such as the Lords and Commons of England had granted him of their free
will(46).Thus we may say that, in the time of Edward the First, the English
Constitution definitely put on the same essential form which it
has kept ever since.The germs of King, Lords, and Commons we had
brought with us from our older home eight hundred years before.But,
from King Edward’s days onwards, we have King, Lords, and Commons
themselves, in nearly the same outward shape, with nearly the same
strictly legal powers, which they still keep.All the great principles
of English freedom were already firmly established.There is indeed
a wide difference between the political condition of England under
Edward the First and the political condition of England in our own
day.But the difference lies far more in the practical working of the
Constitution than in its outward form.The changes have been many; but
a large portion of those changes have not been formal enactments, but
those silent changes whose gradual working has wrought out for us a
conventional Constitution existing alongside of our written Law.Other
changes have been simply improvements in detail; others have been
enactments made to declare more clearly, or to secure more fully in
practice, those rights whose existence was not denied.But, speaking
generally, and allowing for the important class of conventional
understandings which have never been clothed with the form of written
enactments, the main elements of the English Constitution remain now
as they were fixed then.From that time English constitutional history
is not merely an inquiry, however interesting and instructive, into
something which has passed away.It is an inquiry into something which
still lives; it is an inquiry into laws which, whenever they have
not been formally repealed, are in full force at this day.Up to the
reign of Edward the First English history is strictly the domain of
antiquaries.From the reign of Edward the First it becomes the domain
of lawyers(47).We find then—it will be understood with what qualifications I am
speaking—the English Constitution fully grown by the end of the
thirteenth century, and we find it to be, in the shape which it then
took, the work of Earl Simon of Montfort and of King Edward the
First.Now there are several points in which the shape which our
Constitution thus finally took differed from the shapes which were
taken by most of the kindred Constitutions on the Continent.The usual
form taken by a national or provincial assembly in the middle ages
was that of an Assembly of _Estates_.That is to say, it consisted
of representatives of all those classes in the nation which were
possessed of political rights.These in most countries were three,
Nobles, Clergy, and Commons.And the name of the Three Estates, that
is the Nobles, Clergy, and Commons, is equally well known in England,
though the meaning of the three names differs not a little in England
from what it meant elsewhere.In England we never had, unless it were
in the old days of the _Eorlas_, a Nobility such as is understood by
that name in other countries.Elsewhere the nobles formed a distinct
class, a class into which it was perhaps not absolutely impossible for
those who were beneath it to be raised, but from which it was at least
absolutely impossible for any of its members to come down.Whatever the
privileges of the noble might be, they extended to all his children
and their children for ever and ever.In some countries his titles
descend in this way to all his descendants; all the children of a Duke,
for instance, are Dukes and Duchesses.In France, and in most other
countries where the system of Estates existed, the Estate of the Nobles
in the National Assembly was a representation, in some shape or other,
of the whole class of nobles as a distinct body.How different this is
from our House of Lords I need not point out.In strictness, I repeat,
we have no nobility.The seats in our Upper Chamber go by descent and
not by election or nomination; but no political privilege attaches
to the children of their holders.Even the eldest son of the peer,
the future holder of the peerage, is a commoner as long as his father
lives.Whatever titles he bears are simply titles of courtesy which
carry with them no political privileges above other commoners.Nay,
we may go higher still.As the children of the peer have no special
advantage, so neither have the younger children of the King himself.The King’s wife, his eldest son, his eldest daughter, his eldest son’s
wife, all have special privileges by Law.His other children are
simple commoners, unless their father thinks good to raise them, as
he may raise any other of his subjects, to the rank of peerage(48).There is perhaps no feature in our Constitution more important and
more beneficial than this, which binds all ranks together, and which
has hindered us from suffering at any time under the curse of a noble
caste.Yet this marked distinction between our own Constitution and
that of most other countries is purely traditional.We cannot say that
it was enacted by any particular man or in any particular Assembly.But
it is easy to see that the fact that in England our national Assemblies
always went on in some shape or other, that the right of all freemen
to attend in person was never formally abolished, that the King kept
the right of specially summoning whom he would, all helped to hinder
the growth of an exclusive noble caste.The aristocratic sentiment, the
pride of birth, has doubtless been very strong at all times.But it has
been merely a sentiment, resting on no legal foundation.The Crown
could always ennoble any one; but the nobility so granted belonged to
one only of the family at the time, to the actual owner of the peerage.All ranks could at all times freely intermarry; all offices were open
to all freemen; and England, unlike Germany, never saw ecclesiastical
foundations whose members were bound to be of noble birth.The position of the Estate of the Clergy was also widely different in
England from what it was in other countries.In fact the political
position of the Clergy has, ever since Edward the First, been something
utterly anomalous and inconsistent.Elsewhere the representatives of
the Clergy, just like those of the Nobles, formed one distinct Estate
in the Assembly.In England the great Prelates had seats in the House
of Lords, where the Bishops keep them still.But there also existed
the anomalous body called Convocation, whose character has always
fluctuated between that of an ecclesiastical Synod and that of a
parliamentary Estate of the realm(49).The Clergy are still summoned
along with every Parliament; and one distinctly parliamentary function
they held down to the reign of Charles the Second, which was then
taken away without any formal enactment.It was one of our great
constitutional principles established in King Edward’s days that no tax
could be granted to the King except by those who had to pay it.But for
a long time the Lords and the Commons taxed themselves separately, and
the Clergy in their Convocation taxed themselves separately also.And,
till this power was given up, an ecclesiastical benefice gave no right
to vote in the election of members of the House of Commons(50).The Commons too themselves bear a name which had a far different
meaning in England from what it bore elsewhere.The usage by which
the Knights of the shire and the Citizens and Burgesses were brought
together in a single House, whatever was its origin, whether it were
at first the result of design or of happy accident, has been an
usage no less wholesome, no less needful to our full constitutional
developement, than that which decreed that the children of peers
should be commoners.In most other countries the class of men who
were returned as representatives of the counties, the Knights of
the Shire, would have been members of the Estate of the Nobles.In
France the words _nobleman_ and _gentleman_ had the same meaning,
that of the members of an exclusive aristocratic caste.The Commons,
the Third Estate, consisted of the citizens of the privileged towns
only(51).But in England the middle class was not confined to the
towns; it spread itself, in the form of a lesser gentry and a wealthy
yeomanry, over the whole face of the land.That class, the smaller
landowners, was for a long time the strength of the country, and the
happiest results came from the union of their representatives in a
single chamber with those of the cities and boroughs.Each class gained
strength from its fellowship with the other, and the citizen class
gained, from their union on equal terms with the landed gentry, a
consideration which otherwise they might never have reached.In short,
the union of the two, the union of all classes of freemen except the
clergy and the actual members of the peerage, of all classes from the
peer’s eldest son to the smallest freeholder or burgess, made the House
of Commons a real representation of the whole nation, and not of any
single order in the nation.Mark again that the form of government which political writers call
_bi-cameral_, that is to say, where the Legislative Assembly consists
of two Chambers or Houses, arose out of one of the accidents of English
History.The merits of that form of government are now freely under
discussion, but it is assumed on both sides that the only choice
lies between one chamber and two; no one proposes to have three or
four(52).But most of the continental bodies of Estates consisted,
as we have seen, of three Houses; in Sweden, where the peasants, the
small freeholders, were important enough to be separately represented
alongside of the Nobles, Clergy, and Citizens, there were till lately
four(53).The number two became the number of our Houses of Parliament,
not out of any conviction of the advantages of that number, but because
it was found impossible to get the Clergy in England habitually to
act, as they did elsewhere, as a regular member of the parliamentary
body.They shrank from the burthen, or they deemed secular legislation
inconsistent with their profession.Thus, instead of the Clergy
forming, as they did in France, a distinct Estate of the Legislature,
we got a Parliament of two Houses, Lords and Commons, attended by a
kind of ecclesiastical shadow of the Parliament in the shape of the
two Houses of the ecclesiastical Convocation.Thus, for all practical
purposes, there were only two Estates in the English Parliament, Lords
and Commons.Thus the phrase of the Three Estates, which had a meaning
in France, became meaningless in England.For centuries back there has
been no separate Estate of the Clergy; some of their highest members
have belonged to the Estate of the Lords, and the rest to the Estate of
the Commons.Hence has arisen a common but not unnatural misconception,
a misconception as old as the days of the Long Parliament, as to the
meaning of the phrase of the Three Estates.Men constantly use those
words as if they meant the three elements among which the legislative
power is divided, King, Lords, and Commons.But an Estate means a rank
or order or class of men, like the Lords, the Clergy, or the Commons.The King is not an Estate, because there is no class or order of
Kings, the King being one person alone by himself.The proper phrase
is the King and the three Estates of the Realm.But in England, as I
have already shown, the phrase is meaningless, as we have in truth two
Estates only(54).We thus had in England, not an Estate of Nobles, forming a distinct
class from the people, but an Upper House of hereditary and official
Lords, whose privileges were purely personal, and whose children had
no political privilege above other men.Our Bishops and some other of
our ecclesiastical dignitaries had seats in the Upper House, but there
was no distinct Estate of the Clergy, having its distinct voice in
legislation.Our Lower House, lower in name, but gradually to become
upper in real power, came to represent, not merely the inhabitants
of privileged towns, but the whole nation, with the single exception
of the personal holders of hereditary or official seats in the Upper
House.That such an Assembly should gradually draw to itself all the
real powers of the state was in the nature of things; but it was only
gradually that it did so.Few things in our parliamentary history are
more remarkable than the way in which the two Houses have for the most
part worked together.I am not talking of very modern times, but of
times when the two Houses were really coordinate powers in the state.During the six hundred years that the two Houses have lived side by
side, serious disputes between them have been very rare, and those
disputes which have happened have generally had to do with matters of
form and privilege which were chiefly interesting to members of the two
Houses themselves, not with questions which had any great importance
for the nation at large(55).For a while the Commons followed the lead
of the Lords; then the Lords came gradually to follow the lead of the
Commons; but open and violent breaches between the Houses have been
rare indeed.From the days of Earl Simon onwards, both the power of
Parliament as a whole, and the special power of the House of Commons,
was constantly growing.The Parliaments of the fourteenth century
exercised all the powers which our Parliament exercises now, together
with some which modern Parliaments shrink from exercising.That is to
say, the Parliaments of those days were obliged either to do directly
or to leave undone many things which the developement of political
conventionality enables a modern Parliament to do indirectly.The
ancient Parliaments demanded the dismissal of the King’s ministers;
they regulated his personal household; they put his authority into
commission; if need called for such a step, they put forth their last
and greatest power and deposed him from his kingly office.In those
days a change of government, a change of policy, the getting rid of
a bad minister and the putting a better in his place, were things
which never could be done without an open struggle between King and
Parliament; often they could not be done without the bondage, the
imprisonment, or the death, perhaps only of the minister, perhaps even
of the King himself.The same ends can now be gained by a vote of
censure in the House of Commons; in many cases they can be gained even
without a vote of censure, by the simple throwing out of a measure by
which a Ministry has given out that it will stand or fall(56).The fifteenth century, as compared with the thirteenth and fourteenth,
was in some respects a time in which things went back.It is plain
that the Parliaments of that day were bodies which were much less
independent than the Parliaments of earlier times.During the Wars of
the Roses each successive military victor found a Parliament ready to
confirm his claim to the Crown and to decree the condemnation of his
enemies(57).And it was a Parliament of Henry the Sixth which passed
the most reactionary measure which any Parliament ever did pass,
that by which the qualification for a county elector was narrowed to
those freeholders whose estates were of the yearly value of forty
shillings(58).In this case time and the change in the value of money
have redressed the wrong; there may be freeholders whose estates are
under the value of forty shillings, but I cannot think that they are
now a very large or important class.But, to understand the meaning of
the restriction in the fifteenth century, for forty shillings we may
fairly read forty pounds; and certainly, if we struck off the register
all those electors whose qualification is a freehold—much more those
whose qualification is an estate less than a freehold—under the value
of forty pounds, the lessening of the constituencies of our counties
would not be small.On the other hand, during the revolutionary times
which followed, we more than once hear of direct appeals to the people
which remind us of days far earlier.Edward the Fourth and Richard the
Third were chosen Kings, or at least had their claims to the Crown
acknowledged, by gatherings of the citizens of London which remind us
of the wars of Stephen and Matilda(59).Still even in this age, the
power of Parliament was advancing(60); the anxiety of every pretender
to get a parliamentary sanction for his claims was a sign of the
growing importance of Parliament, and we get incidental notices which
show that a seat in the House of Commons, and that not as a knight of a
shire, but as a burgess of a borough, was now an object of ambition for
men of the class from which knights of the shire were chosen, and even
for the sons of members of the Upper House(61).At last came the sixteenth century, the time of trial for parliamentary
institutions in so many countries of Europe.Not a few assemblies which
had once been as free as our own Parliament were, during that age,
either utterly swept away or reduced to empty formalities.Then it
was that Charles the Fifth and Philip the Second overthrew the free
constitutions of Castile and Aragon; before long the States-General
of France met for the last time before their last meeting of all
on the eve of the great Revolution(62).In England parliamentary
institutions were not swept away, nor did Parliament sink into an empty
form.But, for a while, Parliaments, like all our other institutions,
became perverted into instruments of tyranny.Under Henry the Eighth,
Parliaments, like Judges, Juries, and ecclesiastical Synods, decreed
whatever seemed good to the caprice of the despot.Why had they so
fallen away from what they had been in a past age, from what they
were to be again?The reason is plain; the Commons had not yet gained
strength enough to act without the Lords, and the Lords had ceased to
be an independent body.The old nobility had been cut off at Towton
and Barnet, and the new nobility were the abject slaves of the King
to whom they owed their honours.A century later, the new nobility
had inherited the spirit of the old, and the Commons had grown to the
fulness of their power.Thus it came that we find in the Parliaments
of the sixteenth century an abject submission to a tyrant’s will, of
which we find no sign in the Parliaments either of the fourteenth or
of the seventeenth.Very different indeed from the Parliaments which
overthrew Richard the Second and Charles the First were the Parliaments
which, almost without a question, passed bills of attainder against
any man against whom Henry’s caprice had turned, the Parliaments
which, in the great age of religious controversy, were ever ready
to enforce by every penalty that particular shade of doctrine which
for the moment commended itself to the Defender of the Faith, to his
son or to his daughters.Why, it may be asked, in such a state of
things, did not parliamentary institutions perish in England as they
perished in so many other lands?It might be enough to say that no
ruler had an interest in destroying institutions which he found that
he could so conveniently turn to his own purposes.But why did not
those institutions sink into mere forms, which they certainly did not
do, even in the worst times?One reason undoubtedly is that special
insular position of our country which has in so many other ways
given a peculiar turn to our history.The great foe of parliamentary
institutions was the introduction of standing armies.But the sovereign
of England, shut up within his island, had far less need of a standing
army than the sovereigns of the Continent, engaged as they were in
their ceaseless wars with neighbours on their frontiers.But I believe
that the personal character of Henry the Eighth had a great deal to
do with the final preservation of our liberties.Do not for a moment
fancy that I belong to that school of paradox which sets up Henry the
Eighth as a virtuous and beneficent ruler.Do not think that I claim
for him any feelings of direct thankfulness such as I do claim for
Earl Simon and King Edward.The position of Henry is more like the
position of William the Conqueror, though I certainly hold that the
Conqueror was in everything the better man of the two.Both served the
cause of freedom indirectly, and both served it by means of features
in the personal character of each.In one respect indeed William and
Henry stood in utterly different positions towards England.William was
a stranger, and it was largely because he was a stranger that he was
able to do us indirect good.Henry, with all his crimes, was a thorough
Englishman; throughout his reign there was a sympathy between him and
the mass of his subjects, who, after all, did not greatly suffer by the
occasional beheading of a Queen or a Duke.But the despotism of William
and the despotism of Henry agreed in this, that each, even in his worst
deeds, retained a scrupulous regard for the letter of the Law.In the
case of William this is not hard to see for any one who carefully
studies the records of his age(63); in the case of Henry it stands
boldly proclaimed in the broadest facts of English history.While his
fellow-tyrants abroad were everywhere overthrowing free institutions,
Henry was in all things showing them the deepest outward respect.Throughout his reign he took care to do nothing except in outward and
regular legal form, nothing for which he could not shelter himself
under the sanction either of precedent or of written Law.In itself,
this perversion of Law, this clothing of wrong with the garb of right,
is really worse—at all events it is more corrupting—than deeds of open
violence against which men are tempted openly to revolt.But such a
tyranny as Henry’s is one form of the homage which vice pays to virtue;
the careful preservation of the outward forms of freedom makes it
easier for another and happier generation again to kindle the form into
its ancient spirit and life.Every deed of wrong done by Henry with the
assent of Parliament was in truth a witness to the abiding importance
of Parliament; the very degradation of our ancient Constitution was a
step to its revival with new strength and in a more perfect form(64).A like witness to the importance of Parliament in this age was shown
in two other very remarkable ways, whereby the power and importance of
the House of Commons was acknowledged in the very act of corrupting
it.One was the active interference of the Government in parliamentary
elections; the other was the creation of boroughs in order to be
corrupt.One needs no stronger proofs than these of the importance
of the body which it was found needful thus to pack and to manage.The Crown still kept the power of summoning members from any boroughs
which it thought fit, and throughout the Tudor reigns the power was
freely abused by sending writs to places which were likely to return
members who would be subservient to the Court(65).Thus arose many
of the wretched little boroughs in Cornwall and elsewhere which were
disfranchised by our successive Reform Bills.These boroughs, which
always were corrupt and which were created in order to be corrupt, must
be carefully distinguished from another class which perished with them.Many towns to which Earl Simon and King Edward sent writs decayed in
process of time; sometimes they decayed positively; more commonly they
decayed relatively, by being utterly outstripped by younger towns and
so losing the importance which they had once had.The disfranchisement
of both classes was equally just; but the different history of the two
classes should be carefully borne in mind.It was right to take away
its members from Old Sarum, but there had been a time when it was right
to give Old Sarum members.In the case of a crowd of Cornish boroughs,
it not only was right to take away their members, but they never ought
to have had members at all(66).It was in the days of Elizabeth that something of the ancient spirit
again breathed forth.It is then that we come to the beginning of that
long line of parliamentary worthies which stretches on in unbroken
order from her days to our own.A few daring spirits in the Commons’
House now began once more to speak in tones worthy of those great
Assemblies which had taught the Edwards and the Richards that there
was a power in England mightier than their own(67).Under the puny
successor of the great Queen the voice of freedom was heard more
loudly(68).In the next reign the great strife of all came, and a King
of England once more, as in the days of Henry and Simon, stood forth
in arms against his people to learn that the power of his people was
a greater power than his.But in the seventeenth century, just as in
the thirteenth, men did not ask for any rights and powers which were
admitted to be new; they asked only for the better security of those
rights and powers which had been handed on from days of old.Into the
details of that great struggle and of the times which followed it is
not my purpose to enter.I have traced at some length the origin and
growth of our Constitution from the earliest times to its days of
special trial in the days of Tudor and Stewart despotism.Our later
constitutional history rather belongs to an inquiry of another kind.It is mainly a record of silent changes in the practical working of
institutions whose outward and legal form remained untouched.I will
therefore end my consecutive historical sketch—if consecutive it can
claim to be—at the point which we have now reached.Instead of carrying
on any regular constitutional narrative into times nearer to our own, I
will rather choose, as the third part of my subject, the illustration
of one of the special points with which I set out, namely the power
which our gradual developement has given us of retracing our steps, of
falling back, whenever need calls for falling back, on the principles
of earlier, often of the earliest, times.Wittingly or unwittingly,
much of our best modern legislation has, as I have already said, been
a case of advancing by the process of going back.As the last division
of the work which I have taken in hand, I shall try to show in how
many cases we have, as a matter of fact, gone back from the cumbrous
and oppressive devices of feudal and royalist lawyers to the sounder,
freer, and simpler principles of the days of our earliest freedom.IN my two former chapters I have carried my brief sketch of the history
of the English Constitution down to the great events of the seventeenth
century.I chose that point as the end of my consecutive narrative,
because the peculiar characteristic of the times which have followed
has been that so many and such important practical changes have been
made without any change in the written Law, without any re-enactment of
the Law, without any fresh declaration of its meaning.The movements
and revolutions of former times, as I have before said, seldom sought
any acknowledged change in the Law, but rather its more distinct
enactment, its more careful and honest administration.This was the
general character of all the great steps in our political history, from
the day when William of Normandy renewed the Laws of Eadward to the day
when William of Orange gave his royal assent to the Bill of Rights.But, though each step in our progress took the shape, not of the
creation of a new right, but of the firmer establishment of an old one,
yet each step was marked by some formal and public act which stands
enrolled among the landmarks of our progress.Some Charter was granted
by the Sovereign, some Act of Parliament was passed by the Estates
of the Realm, setting forth in legal form the nature and measure of
the rights which it was sought to place on a firmer ground.Since
the seventeenth century things have in this respect greatly altered.The work of legislation, of strictly constitutional legislation, has
never ceased; a long succession of legislative enactments stand out as
landmarks of political progress no less in more recent than in earlier
times.But alongside of them there has also been a series of political
changes, changes of no less moment than those which are recorded in the
statute-book, which have been made without any legislative enactment
whatever.A whole code of political maxims, universally acknowledged
in theory, universally carried out in practice, has grown up, without
leaving among the formal acts of our legislature any trace of the
steps by which it grew.Up to the end of the seventeenth century,
we may fairly say that no distinction could be drawn between the
Constitution and the Law.The prerogative of the Crown, the privilege
of Parliament, the liberty of the subject, might not always be clearly
defined on every point.It has indeed been said that those three things
were all of them things to which in their own nature no limit could be
set.But all three were supposed to rest, if not on the direct words
of the Statute Law, yet at least on that somewhat shadowy yet very
practical creation, that mixture of genuine ancient traditions and of
recent devices of lawyers, which is known to Englishmen as the Common
Law.Any breach either of the rights of the Sovereign or of the rights
of the subject was a legal offence, capable of legal definition and
subjecting the offender to legal penalties.An act which could not be
brought within the letter either of the Statute or of the Common Law
would not then have been looked upon as an offence at all.If lower
courts were too weak to do justice, the High Court of Parliament stood
ready to do justice even against the mightiest offenders.It was armed
with weapons fearful and rarely used, but none the less regular and
legal.It could smite by impeachment, by attainder, by the exercise
of the greatest power of all, the deposition of the reigning King.But men had not yet reached the more subtle doctrine that there may
be offences against the Constitution which are no offences against
the Law.They had not learned that men in high office may have a
responsibility practically felt and acted on, but which no legal
enactment has defined, and which no legal tribunal can enforce.It had
not been found out that Parliament itself has a power, now practically
the highest of its powers, in which it acts neither as a legislature
nor as a court of justice, but in which it pronounces sentences which
have none the less practical force because they carry with them none of
the legal consequences of death, bonds, banishment, or confiscation.We
now have a whole system of political morality, a whole code of precepts
for the guidance of public men, which will not be found in any page of
either the Statute or the Common Law, but which are in practice held
hardly less sacred than any principle embodied in the Great Charter
or in the Petition of Right.In short, by the side of our written Law
there has grown up an unwritten or conventional Constitution.When an
Englishman speaks of the conduct of a public man being constitutional
or unconstitutional, he means something wholly different from what he
means by his conduct being legal or illegal.A famous vote of the House
of Commons, passed on the motion of a great statesman, once declared
that the then Ministers of the Crown did not possess the confidence
of the House of Commons, and that their continuance in office was
therefore at variance with the spirit of the Constitution(1).The truth
of such a position, according to the traditional principles on which
public men have acted for some generations, cannot be disputed; but
it would be in vain to seek for any trace of such doctrines in any
page of our written Law.The proposer of that motion did not mean to
charge the existing Ministry with any illegal act, with any act which
could be made the subject either of a prosecution in a lower court
or of impeachment in the High Court of Parliament itself.He did not
mean that they, Ministers of the Crown, appointed during the pleasure
of the Crown, committed any breach of the Law of which the Law could
take cognizance, merely by keeping possession of their offices till
such time as the Crown should think good to dismiss them from those
offices.What he meant was that the general course of their policy was
one which to a majority of the House of Commons did not seem to be
wise or beneficial to the nation, and that therefore, according to a
conventional code as well understood and as effectual as the written
Law itself, they were bound to resign offices of which the House of
Commons no longer held them to be worthy.The House made no claim to
dismiss those Ministers from their offices by any act of its own; it
did not even petition the Crown to remove them from their offices.It
simply spoke its mind on their general conduct, and it was held that,
when the House had so spoken, it was their duty to give way without
any formal petition, without any formal command, on the part either
of the House or of the Sovereign(2).The passing by the House of
Commons of such a resolution as this may perhaps be set down as the
formal declaration of a constitutional principle.But though a formal
declaration, it was not a legal declaration.It created a precedent for
the practical guidance of future Ministers and future Parliaments, but
it neither changed the Law nor declared it.It asserted a principle
which might be appealed to in future debates in the House of Commons,
but it asserted no principle which could be taken any notice of by a
Judge in any Court of Law.It stands therefore on a wholly different
ground from those enactments which, whether they changed the Law or
simply declared the Law, had a real legal force, capable of being
enforced by a legal tribunal.If any officer of the Crown should levy a
tax without the authority of Parliament, if he should enforce martial
law without the authority of Parliament, he would be guilty of a legal
crime.But, if he merely continues to hold an office conferred by the
Crown and from which the Crown has not removed him, though he hold it
in the teeth of any number of votes of censure passed by both Houses of
Parliament, he is in no way a breaker of the written Law.But the man
who should so act would be universally held to have trampled under foot
one of the most undoubted principles of the unwritten but universally
accepted Constitution.The remarkable thing is that, of these two kinds of hypothetical
offences, the latter, the guilt of which is purely conventional, is
almost as unlikely to happen as the former, whose guilt is a matter
established by Law.The power of the Law is so firmly established among
us that the possibility of breaches of the Law on the part of the
Crown or its Ministers hardly ever comes into our heads.And conduct
sinning against the broad lines of the unwritten Constitution is looked
on as hardly less unlikely.Political men may debate whether such and
such a course is or is not constitutional, just as lawyers may debate
whether such a course is or is not legal.But the very form of the
debate implies that there is a Constitution to be observed, just as
in the other case it implies that there is a Law to be observed.Now
this firm establishment of a purely unwritten and conventional code
is one of the most remarkable facts in history.It is plain that it
implies the firmest possible establishment of the power of the written
Law as its groundwork.If there were the least fear of breaches of the
written Law on the part of the Crown or its officers, we should be
engaged in finding means for getting rid of that more serious danger,
not in disputing over points arising out of a code which has no legal
existence.But it is well sometimes to stop and remember how thoroughly
conventional the whole of our received system is.The received doctrine
as to the relations of the two Houses of Parliament to one another, the
whole theory of the position of the body known as the Cabinet and of
its chief the Prime Minister, every detail in short of the practical
working of government among us, is a matter belonging wholly to the
unwritten Constitution and not at all to the written Law.The limits
of the royal authority are indeed clearly defined by the written Law.But I suspect that many people would be amazed at the amount of power
which the Crown still possesses by Law, and at the many things, which
in our eyes would seem utterly monstrous, but which might yet be done
by royal authority without any law being broken.The Law indeed secures
us against arbitrary legislation, against the repeal of any old laws,
or the enactment of any new ones, without the consent of both Houses
of Parliament(3).But it is the unwritten Constitution alone which
makes it practically impossible for the Crown to refuse its assent to
measures which have passed both Houses of Parliament, and which in many
cases makes it almost equally impossible to refuse the prayer of an
address sent up by one of those Houses only.The written Law leaves to
the Crown the choice of all its ministers and agents, great and small;
their appointment to office and their removal from office, as long as
they commit no crime which the Law can punish, is a matter left to
the personal discretion of the Sovereign.The unwritten Constitution
makes it practically impossible for the Sovereign to keep a Minister
in office of whom the House of Commons does not approve, and it makes
it almost equally impossible to remove from office a Minister of
whom the House of Commons does approve(4).The written Law and the
unwritten Constitution alike exempt the Sovereign from all ordinary
personal responsibility(5).They both transfer the responsibility from
the Sovereign himself to his agents and advisers.But the nature and
extent of their responsibility is widely different in the eyes of the
written Law and in the eyes of the unwritten Constitution.The written
Law is satisfied with holding that the command of the Sovereign is no
excuse for an illegal act, and that he who advises the commission of
an illegal act by royal authority must bear the responsibility from
which the Sovereign himself is free.The written Law knows nothing of
any responsibility but such as may be enforced either by prosecution in
the ordinary Courts or by impeachment in the High Court of Parliament.The unwritten Constitution lays the agents and advisers of the Crown
under a responsibility of quite another kind.What we understand by
the responsibility of Ministers is that they are liable to have all
their public acts discussed in Parliament, not only on the ground
of their legal or illegal character, but on the vaguest grounds of
their general tendency.They may be in no danger of prosecution or
impeachment; but they are no less bound to bow to other signs of the
will of the House of Commons; the unwritten Constitution makes a
vote of censure as effectual as an impeachment, and in many cases it
makes a mere refusal to pass a ministerial measure as effectual as a
vote of censure.The written Law knows nothing of the Cabinet or the
Prime Minister; it knows them as members of one or the other House of
Parliament, as Privy Councillors, as holders, each man in his own
person, of certain offices; but, as a collective body bound together
by a common responsibility, the Law never heard of them(6).But in the
eye of the unwritten Constitution the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of
which he is the head form the main feature of our system of government.It is plain at a moment’s glance that the practical power of the Crown
is not now what it was in the reign of William the Third or even in
that of George the Third.But the change is due, far less to changes in
the written Law than to changes in the unwritten Constitution.The Law
leaves the powers of the Crown untouched, but the Constitution requires
that those powers should be exercised by such persons, and in such a
manner, as may be acceptable to a majority of the House of Commons.In
all these ways, in a manner silent and indirect, the Lower House of
Parliament, as it is still deemed in formal rank, has become the really
ruling power in the nation.There is no greater contrast than that
which exists between the humility of its formal dealings with the Crown
and even with the Upper House(7), and the reality of the irresistible
power which it exercises over both.It is so conscious of the mighty
force of its indirect powers that it no longer cares to claim the
direct powers which it exercised in former times.There was a time
when Parliament was directly consulted on questions of War and Peace.There was a time when Parliament claimed directly to appoint several
of the chief officers of state(8).There were much later times when it
was no unusual thing to declare a man in power to be a public enemy,
or directly to address the Crown for his removal from office and from
the royal presence.No such direct exercises of parliamentary power are
needed now, because the whole machinery of government may be changed by
the simple process of the House refusing to pass a measure on which the
Minister has made up his mind to stake his official being.Into the history of the stages by which this most remarkable state
of things has been brought about I do not intend here to enter.The
code of our unwritten Constitution has, like all other English things,
grown up bit by bit, and, for the most part, silently and without any
acknowledged author.Yet some stages of the developement are easily
pointed out, and they make important landmarks.The beginning may be
placed in the reign of William the Third, when we first find anything
at all like a _Ministry_ in the modern sense.Up to that time the
servants of the Crown had been servants of the Crown, each man in
the personal discharge of his own office.The holder of each office
owed faithful service to the Crown, and he was withal responsible to
the Law; but he stood in no special fellowship towards the holder
of any other office.Provided he discharged his own duties, nothing
hindered him from being the personal or political enemy of any of his
fellow-servants.It was William who first saw that, if the King’s
government was to be carried on, there must be at least a general
agreement of opinions and aims among the King’s chief agents in his
government(9).From this beginning a system has gradually grown up
which binds the chief officers of the Crown to work together in at
least outward harmony, to undertake the defence of one another, and
on vital points to stand and fall together.Another important stage
happened in much later times, when the King ceased to take a share in
person in the deliberations of his Cabinet.And I may mark a change
in language which has happened within my own memory, and which, like
other changes of language, is certainly not without its meaning.We
now familiarly speak, in Parliament and out of Parliament, of the body
of Ministers actually in power, the body known to the Constitution but
wholly unknown to the Law, by the name of “the Government.” We speak
of “Mr.Gladstone’s Government” or “Mr.Disraeli’s Government.” I can
myself remember the time when such a form of words was unknown, when
“Government” still meant “Government by King, Lords, and Commons,” and
when the body of men who acted as the King’s immediate advisers were
spoken of as “Ministers” or “the Ministry”(10).This kind of silent, I might say stealthy, growth, has, without
the help of any legislative enactment, produced that unwritten
and conventional code of political rules which we speak of as the
Constitution.This process I have spoken of as being characteristic
of the days since the Revolution of 1688, as distinguished from
earlier times.At no earlier time have so
many important changes in constitutional doctrine and practice won
universal acceptance without being recorded in any written enactment.Yet this tendency of later times is, after all, only a further
developement of a tendency which was at work from the beginning.It
is simply another application of the Englishman’s love of precedent.The growth of the unwritten Constitution has much in common with the
earlier growth of the unwritten Common Law.I have shown in earlier
chapters that some of the most important principles of our earlier
Constitution were established silently and by the power of precedent,
without resting on any known written enactment.If we cannot show any
Act of Parliament determining the relations in which the members of
the Cabinet stand to the Crown, to the House of Commons, and to one
another, neither can we show the Act of Parliament which decreed, in
opposition to the practice of all other nations, that the children of
the hereditary Peer should be simple Commoners.The real difference is
that, in more settled times, when Law was fully supreme, it was found
that many important practical changes might be made without formal
changes in the Law.It was also found that there is a large class of
political subjects which can be better dealt with in this way of tacit
understandings than they can be in the shape of a formal enactment by
Law.We practically understand what is meant by Ministers having or not
having the confidence of the House of Commons; we practically recognise
the cases in which, as not having the confidence of the House, they
ought to resign office and the cases in which they may fairly appeal
to the country by a dissolution of Parliament.But it would be utterly
impossible to define such cases beforehand in the terms of an Act of
Parliament.Or again, the Speaker of the House of Commons is an officer
known to the Law.The Leader of the House of Commons is a person as
well known to the House and the country, his functions are as well
understood, as those of the Speaker himself.But of the Leader of the
House of Commons the Law knows nothing.It would be hopeless to seek to
define his duties in any legal form, and the House itself has, before
now, shrunk from recognising the existence of such a person in any
shape of which a Court of Law could take notice(11).During a time then which is now not very far short of two hundred
years, the silent and extra-legal growth of our conventional
Constitution has been at least as important as the actual changes
in our written Law.With regard to these last, the point on which I
wish chiefly to dwell is the way in which not a few pieces of modern
legislation have been—whether wittingly or unwittingly I do not profess
to know—a return to the simpler principles of our oldest constitution.I trust to show that, in many important points, we have cast aside
the legal subtleties which grew up from the thirteenth century to the
seventeenth, and that we have gone back to the plain common sense of
the eleventh or tenth, and of times far earlier still.In those ancient
times we had already laws, but we had as yet no lawyers.We hear in
early times of men who were versed above others in the laws of the
land; but such special knowledge is spoken of as the attribute of age
or of experience in public business, not as the private possession of
a professional class(12).The class of professional lawyers grew up
along with the growth of a more complicated and technical jurisprudence
under our Norman and Angevin Kings.Now I mean no disrespect to
a profession which in our present artificial state of society we
certainly cannot do without, but there can be no kind of doubt that
lawyers’ interpretations and lawyers’ ways of looking at things have
done no small mischief, not only to the true understanding of our
history but to the actual course of our history itself.The lawyer’s
tendency is to carry to an unreasonable extent that English love of
precedent which, within reasonable bounds, is one of our most precious
safeguards.His virtue is that of acute and logical inference from
given premisses; the premisses themselves he is commonly satisfied to
take without examination from those who have gone before him.It is
often wonderful to see the amazing ingenuity with which lawyers have
piled together inference upon inference, starting from some purely
arbitrary assumption of their own.Each stage of the argument, taken
by itself, is absolutely unanswerable; the objection must be taken
earlier, before the argument begins.The argument is perfect, if we
only admit the premisses; the only unlucky thing is that the premisses
will constantly be found to be historically worthless.Add to this that
the natural tendency of the legal mind is to conservatism and deference
to authority.This will always be the case, even with thoroughly
honest men in an age when honesty is no longer dangerous.But this
tendency will have tenfold force in times when an honest setting forth
of the Law might expose its author to the disfavour of an arbitrary
government.We shall therefore find that the premisses from which
lawyers’ arguments have started, but which historical study shows to be
unsound, are commonly premisses devised in favour of the prerogative
of the Crown, not in favour of the rights of the people.Indeed the
whole ideal conception of the Sovereign, as one, personally at least,
above the Law, as one personally irresponsible and incapable of doing
wrong, the whole conception of the Sovereign as the sole fountain of
all honour, as the original grantor of all property, as the source
from which all authority of every kind issues in the first instance,
is purely a lawyer’s conception, and rests upon no ground whatever in
the records of our early history(13).In later times indeed the evil
has largely corrected itself; the growth of our unwritten Constitution
under the hands of statesmen has done much practically to get rid of
these slavish devices of lawyers.The personal irresponsibility of the
Sovereign becomes practically harmless when the powers of the Crown are
really exercised by Ministers who act under a twofold responsibility,
both to the written Law and to the unwritten Constitution.Yet even
now small cases of hardship sometimes happen in which some traditional
maxim of lawyers, some device devised in favour of the prerogative of
the Crown, stands in the way of the perfectly equal administration
of justice.But in several important cases the lawgiver has directly
stepped in to wipe out the inventions of the lawyer, and modern Acts of
Parliament have brought things back to the simpler principles of our
earliest forefathers.I will wind up my sketch of our constitutional
history by pointing out several cases in which this happy result has
taken place.For many ages it was a legal doctrine universally received that
Parliament at once expired at the death of the reigning King.The
argument by which the lawyers reached this conclusion is, like most of
their arguments, altogether unanswerable, provided only we admit their
premisses.According to the lawyers’ conception, whatever might be the
powers of Parliament when it actually came together, however much the
King might be bound to act by its advice, consent, and authority, the
Parliament itself did nevertheless derive its being from the authority
of the King.Parliament was summoned by the King’s writ.The King
might indeed be bound to issue the writs for its summons; still it was
from the King’s writ that the Parliament actually derived its being
and its powers.By another legal assumption, the force of the King’s
writ was held to last only during the lifetime of the King who issued
it.It followed therefore that Parliament, summoned by the King’s
writ and deriving its authority from the King’s writ, was dissolved
_ipso facto_ by the death of the King who summoned it.Once admit the
assumptions from which this reasoning starts, and the reasoning itself
is perfect.Let us see how
this mass of legal subtlety would have looked in the eyes of a man of
the eleventh century, in the eyes of a man who had borne his part in
the elections of Eadward and of Harold, and who had raised his voice
and clashed his arms in the great Assembly which restored Godwine to
his lands and honours(14).To such an one the doctrine that a national
Assembly could be gathered together only by the King’s writ, and the
consequent doctrine that the national Assembly ceased to exist when the
breath went out of the King’s body, would have seemed like the babble
of a madman.When was the gathering together of the national Assembly
more needed, when was it called upon to exercise higher and more
inherent powers, than when the throne was actually vacant, and when
the Assembly of the nation came together to determine who should fill
it?And how could the Assembly be gathered together by the King’s writ
when there was no King in the land to issue a writ?The King’s writ
would be, in his eyes, a convenient way in ordinary times for fixing
a time and place for the meetings of the Assembly, but it would be
nothing more.It would be in no sense the source of the powers of the
Assembly, powers which he would look upon as derived from the simple
fact that the Assembly was itself the nation.In his eyes it was not
the King who created the Assembly, but the Assembly which created the
King.The doctrine that the King never dies, that the throne never can
be vacant, would have seemed gibberish to one who had seen the throne
vacant and had borne his part in filling it.The doctrine that the
King can do no wrong would have seemed no less gibberish to one who
knew that he might possibly be called on to bear his part in deposing
a King.Three of the most famous Assemblies in English history have
ever been puzzles in the eyes of mere legal interpreters; to the man of
the eleventh century they would have seemed to be perfectly legal and
regular, alike in their constitution and in their acts.The Assembly
which in 1399 deposed Richard the Second and elected Henry the Fourth,
though summoned by the King’s writ, was not opened by his commission,
and it seems to have shrunk from taking the name of Parliament, and to
have acted only by the name of the Estates of the Realm.As an Assembly
which was in some sort irregular, it seems to have shrunk from going
through the usual forms of a regular Parliament, and, though it did
in the end exercise the greatest of parliamentary powers, it seems to
have been afraid to look its own act in the face.Richard was deposed,
but his deposition was mixed up with a resignation of the Crown on
his own part, and with a challenge of the Crown on the part of Henry.Then, as a demise of the Crown had taken place, it was held that the
same legal consequences followed as if that demise had been caused by
the death of the King.It was held that the Parliament which had been
summoned by the writ of King Richard ceased to exist when Richard
ceased to be King, and, as it was not thought good to summon a new
Parliament, the same Parliament was, by a legal fiction, summoned again
under the writ of King Henry(15).All these doubts and difficulties,
all these subtleties of lawyers, would have been wholly unintelligible
to a man of the eleventh century.In his eyes the Witan would have come
together, whether by King Richard’s writ or not it mattered little;
having come together, they had done the two greatest of national acts
by deposing one King and choosing another; having done this, if there
was any other national business to be done, there was no reason on
earth why they should not go on and do it.Take again another Assembly
of equal importance in our history, the Convention which voted the
recall—that is, in truth, the election—of Charles the Second.That
Assembly succeeded a Parliament which had ventured on a still stronger
step than deposing a King, that of sending a reigning King to trial and
execution(16).It was not held in 1649 that the Long Parliament came
to an end when the axe fell on the neck of Charles the First, but the
doctrine that it ought to have done so was not forgotten eleven years
later(17).And the Convention which was elected, as freely as any
Parliament ever was elected(18), in answer to the vote of the expiring
Long Parliament, was, because it was so elected and not in answer to
the King’s writ, looked on as an Assembly of doubtful validity.It
acted as a Parliament; it restored the King; it granted him a revenue;
and it did a more wonderful work than all, for it created itself, and
passed an Act declaring itself to be a lawful Parliament(19).Yet,
after all, it was deemed safer that all the Acts of the Convention
Parliament should be confirmed by its successor which was summoned in
due form by the King’s writ.These fantastic subtleties, subtleties
worthy of the kindred device by which the first year of Charles’s reign
was called the twelfth, would again have been wholly unintelligible
to our man of the eleventh century.He might have remembered that the
Assembly which restored Æthelred—which restored him on conditions,
while Charles was restored without conditions—did not scruple to go on
and pass a series of the most important decrees that were passed in
any of our early Assemblies(20).Once more again, the Convention which
deposed James and elected William, seemed, like that which deposed
Richard and elected Henry, to doubt its own existence and to shrink
from its own act.James was deposed; but the Assembly which deposed
him ventured not to use the word, and, as an extorted abdication was
deemed expedient in the case of Richard, so a constructive abdication
was imagined in the case of James(21).And the Assembly which elected
William, like the Assembly which elected Henry and that which elected
Charles, prolonged its own existence by the same transparent fiction
of voting itself to be a lawful Parliament.Wise men held at the time
that, at least in times of revolution, a Parliament might be called
into being by some other means than that of the writ of a King.Yet it
was deemed that some additional security was given to the existence of
the Assembly and to the validity of its acts by this second exercise
of the mysterious power of self-creation(22).Once more in the same
reign the question was brought forward whether a Parliament summoned
by the joint writ of William and Mary did not expire when Mary died
and William reigned alone.This subtlety was suggested only to be
contemptuously cast aside; yet it may be fairly doubted whether it was
not worth at least as much as any of the kindred subtleties which on
the three earlier occasions were deemed of such vast importance(23).The untutored wisdom of Englishmen, in the days when we had laws but
when those laws had not yet been made the sport of the subtleties of
lawyers, would have seen as little force in the difficulties which it
was deemed necessary to get over by solemn parliamentary enactments as
in the difficulty which neither House of Parliament thought worthy of
any serious discussion.And now what has modern legislation done towards getting rid of all
these pettifogging devices, and towards bringing us back to the simpler
doctrines of our forefathers?Parliament is still summoned by the
writ of the Sovereign; in settled times no other way of bringing it
together can be so convenient.But, if times of revolution should ever
come again, we, who do even our revolutions according to precedent,
shall probably have learned something from the revolutionary precedents
of 1399, of 1660, and of 1688.In each later case the subtlety is
one degree less subtle than in the former.The Estates of the Realm
which deposed Richard were changed into a Parliament of Henry by the
transparent fiction of sending out writs which were not, and could not
be, followed by any real elections.The Convention which recalled or
elected Charles the Second did indeed turn itself into a Parliament,
but it was deemed needful that its acts should be confirmed by another
Parliament.The acts of the Convention of 1688 were not deemed to need
any such confirmation.Each of these differences marks a stage in the
return to the doctrine of common sense, that, convenient as it is in
all ordinary times that Parliament should be summoned by the writ of
the Sovereign, yet it is not from that summons, but from the choice of
the people, that Parliament derives its real being and its inherent
powers.As for the other end of the lawyers’ doctrine, the inference
that Parliament is _ipso facto_ dissolved by a demise of the Crown,
from that a more rational legislation has set us free altogether.Though modern Parliaments are no longer called on to elect Kings, yet
experience and common sense have taught us that the time when the
Sovereign is changed is exactly the time when the Great Council of
the Nation ought to be in full life and activity.By a statute only a
few years later than the raising of the question whether a Parliament
of William and Mary did or did not expire by the death of Mary, all
such subtleties were swept away.It was now deemed so needful that the
new Sovereign should have a Parliament ready to act with him, that it
became the Law that the Parliament which was in being at the time of
a demise of the Crown should remain in being for six months, unless
specially dissolved by the new Sovereign.A later statute went further
still, and provided that, if a demise of the Crown should take place
during the short interval when there is no Parliament in being, the
last Parliament should _ipso facto_ revive, and should continue in
being, unless a second time dissolved, for six months more.Thus the
event which, by the perverted ingenuity of lawyers, was held to have
the power of destroying a Parliament, was, by the wisdom of later
legislation, clothed with the power of calling a Parliament into being.Lastly, in our own days, all traces of the lawyers’ superstition have
been swept away, and the demise of the Crown now in no way affects the
duration of the existing Parliament(24).Truly this is a case where
the letter killeth and the spirit giveth life.The doctrine which had
been inferred by unanswerable logic from an utterly worthless premiss
has been cast aside in favour of the dictate of common sense.We have
learned that the moment when the State has lost its head is the last
moment which we ought to choose for depriving it of its body also.Here then is a notable instance of the way in which the latest
legislation of England has fallen back upon the principles of the
earliest.Here is a point on which the eleventh century and the
nineteenth are of one mind, and on which the fanciful scruples of the
fourteenth and the seventeenth centuries are no longer listened to.In the old Teutonic Constitution, just as in
the old Roman Constitution, large tracts of land were the property of
the State, the _ager publicus_ of Rome, the _folkland_ of England.As
the royal power grew, as the King came to be more and more looked on
as the impersonation of the nation, the land of the people came to be
more and more looked on as the land of the King, and the _folkland_
of our Old-English charters gradually changed into the _Terra Regis_
of Domesday(25).Like other changes of the kind, the Norman Conquest
only strengthened and brought to its full effect a tendency which was
already at work; but there can be no doubt that, down to the Norman
Conquest, the King at least went through the form of consulting his
Witan, before he alienated the land of the people to become the
possession of an individual—in Old-English phrase, before he turned
_folkland_ into _bookland_(26).After the Norman Conquest we hear no
more of the land of the people; it has become the land of the King, to
be dealt with according to the King’s personal pleasure.From the days
of the first William to those of the Third, the land which had once
been the land of the people was dealt with without any reference to
the will of the people.Under a conscientious King it might be applied
to the real service of the State, or bestowed as the reward of really
faithful servants of the State.Under an unconscientious King it might
be squandered broadcast among his minions or his mistresses(27).A custom as strong as law now requires
that, at the beginning of each fresh reign, the Sovereign shall, not
by an act of bounty but by an act of justice, give back to the nation
the land which the nation lost so long ago.The royal demesnes are now
handed over to be dealt with like the other revenues of the State, to
be disposed of by Parliament for the public service(28).That is to
say, the people have won back their own; the usurpation of the days of
foreign rule has been swept away.We have in this case too gone back
to the sound principles of our forefathers; the _Terra Regis_ of the
Norman has once more become the _folkland_ of the days of our earliest
freedom.I will quote another case, a case in which the return from the
fantasies of lawyers to the common sense of antiquity has been
distinctly to the profit, if not of the abstraction called the Crown,
yet certainly to that of its personal holder.As long as the _folkland_
remained the land of the people, as long as our monarchy retained
its ancient elective character, the King, like any other man, could
inherit, purchase, bequeath, or otherwise dispose of, the lands which
were his own private property as much as the lands of other men were
theirs.We have the wills of several of our early Kings which show that
a King was in this respect as free as any other man(29).But as the
lawyers’ figment of hereditary right took root, as the other lawyers’
figment also took root by which the lands of the people were held to
be at the personal disposal of the King, a third figment grew up, by
which it was held that the person and the office of the King were so
inseparably fused into one that any private estates which the King held
before his accession to the throne became _ipso facto_ part and parcel
of the royal demesne.As long as the Crown remained an elective office,
the injustice of such a rule would have made itself plain; it would
have been at once seen to be as unreasonable as if it had been held
that the private estates of a Bishop should merge in the estates of
his see.As long as there was no certainty that the children or other
heirs of the reigning King would ever succeed to his Crown, it would
have been the height of injustice to deprive them in this way of their
natural inheritance.The election of a King would have carried with
it the confiscation of his private estate.But when the Crown was held
to be hereditary, when the _folkland_ was held to be _Terra Regis_,
this hardship was no longer felt.The eldest son was provided for by
his right of succession to the Crown, and the power of disposing of the
Crown lands at pleasure gave the King the means of providing for his
younger children.Still the doctrine was none the less unreasonable;
it was a doctrine founded on no ground either of natural justice or of
ancient law; it was a mere inference which had gradually grown up out
of mere arbitrary theories about the King’s powers and prerogatives.And, as the old state of things gradually came back again, as men
began to feel that the demesnes of the Crown were not the private
possession of the reigning King, but were the true possession of the
people—that is, as the _Terra Regis_ again came back to its old state
of _folkland_—it was felt to be unreasonable to shut out the Sovereign
from a natural right which belonged to every one of his subjects.The
land which, to put it in the mildest form, the King held in trust for
the common service of the nation was now again employed to its proper
use.It was therefore reasonable that a restriction which belonged
to a past state of things should be swept away, and that Sovereigns
who had given up an usurped power which they ought never to have held
should be restored to the enjoyment of a natural right which ought
never to have been taken from them.As our present Sovereign in so many
other respects holds the place of Ælfred rather than the place of the
Richards and Henries of later times, so she again holds the right which
Ælfred held, of acquiring and disposing of private property like any
other member of the nation(30).These examples are, I hope, enough to make out my case.In each of them
modern legislation has swept away the arbitrary inferences of lawyers,
and has gone back to those simpler principles which the untutored
wisdom of our forefathers never thought of calling in question.I
could easily make the list much longer.Every act which has restrained
the arbitrary prerogative of the Crown, every act which has secured
or increased either the powers of Parliament or the liberty of the
subject, has been a return, sometimes to the letter, at all times to
the spirit, of our earliest Law.But I would enlarge on one point
only, the most important point of all, and a point in which we may
at first sight seem, not to have come nearer, but to have gone away
further from the principles of early times.I mean with regard to the
succession to the Crown.The Crown was of old, as I have already said,
elective.No man had a right to become King till he had been called
to the kingly office by the choice of the Assembly of the nation.No
man actually was King till he had been admitted to the kingly office
by the consecration of the Church.The doctrines that the King never
dies, that the throne never can be vacant, that there can be no
interregnum, that the reign of the next heir begins the moment the
reign of his predecessor is ended, are all figments of later times.No signs of such doctrines can be found at any time earlier than the
accession of Edward the First(31).The strong preference which in early
times belonged to members of the kingly house, above all to the born
son of a crowned King(32), gradually grew, under the influences which
the Norman Conquest finally confirmed, into the doctrine of absolute
hereditary right.That doctrine grew along with the general growth of
the royal power; it grew as men gradually came to look on kingship as
a possession held by a single man for his own profit, rather than as
an office bestowed by the people for the common good of the realm.It
might seem that, in this respect at least, we have not gone forward,
but that we rather have gone back.For nothing is more certain than
that the Crown is more strictly and undoubtedly hereditary now than it
was in the days of Normans, Angevins, or Tudors.But a little thought
will show that in this case also, we have not gone back but have gone
forward.That is to say, we have gone forward by going back, by going
back, in this case, not to the letter, but assuredly to the spirit of
earlier times.The Crown is now more undoubtedly hereditary than it
was in the fifteenth or sixteenth century; but this is because it is
now hereditary by Law, because its powers are distinctly defined by
Law.The will of the people, the source of all Law and of all power,
has been exercised, not in the old form of personally choosing a King
at every vacancy of the Crown, but by an equally lawful exercise of
the national will, which has thought good to entail the Crown on a
particular family.It was in the reign of our last elective King that the Crown first
became legally hereditary.The doctrine may seem a startling one, but
it is one to which an unbiassed study of our history will undoubtedly
lead us.Few things are more amusing than the treatment which our early
history has met with at the hands of purely legal writers.There is
something almost pitiable in the haltings and stumblings of such a
writer as Blackstone, unable to conceive that his lawyer’s figment
of hereditary right was anything short of eternal, and yet coming at
every moment across events which showed that in early times all such
figments were utterly unknown(33).In early times the King was not
only elected, but he went through a twofold election.I have already
said that the religious character with which most nations have thought
good to clothe their Kings took in England, as in most other Christian
lands, the form of an ecclesiastical consecration to the kingly office.That form we still retain; but in modern times it has become a mere
form, a pageant impressive no doubt and instructive, but still a mere
pageant, which gives the crowned King no powers which he did not
equally hold while still uncrowned.The death of the former King at
once puts his successor in possession of every kingly right and power;
his coronation in no way adds to his legal authority, however much it
may add to his personal responsibility towards God and his people.But
this was not so of old time.The choice of the national Assembly gave
the King so chosen the sole right to become King, but it did not make
him King.The King-elect was like a Bishop-elect.The recommendation
of the Crown, the election of the Chapter, and the confirmation of the
Archbishop, give a certain man the sole right to a certain see, but
it is only the purely religious rite of consecration which makes him
actually Bishop of it(34).The choice
of the Witan made him King-elect, but it was only the ecclesiastical
crowning and anointing which made him King.And this ecclesiastical
ceremony involved a further election.Chosen already to the civil
office by the Nation in its civil character, he was again chosen by
the Church—that is, by the Nation in its religious character, by the
Clergy and People assembled in the church where the crowning rite was
to be done(35).This second ecclesiastical election must always have
been a mere form, as the choice of the nation was already made before
the ecclesiastical ceremony began.But the ecclesiastical election
survived the civil one.The state of things which lawyers dream of
from the beginning is a law of strict hereditary succession, broken
in upon by occasional interruptions.These interruptions, which, in
the eye of history, are simply exercises of an ancient right, are, in
the eyes of lawyers, only revolutions or usurpations.But this state
of things, a state in which a fixed rule was sometimes broken, which
Blackstone dreams of in the tenth and eleventh centuries, really did
exist from the thirteenth century onwards.From the accession of
Edward the First, the first King who reigned before his coronation,
hereditary succession became the rule in practice.The son, or even the
grandson, of the late King(36) was commonly acknowledged as a matter
of course, without anything which could fairly be called an election.But the right of Parliament to settle the succession was constantly
exercised, and ever and anon we come across signs which show that
the ancient notion of an election of a still more popular kind had
not wholly passed away out of men’s minds.Two Kings were formally
deposed, and on the deposition of the second the Crown passed, as
it might have done in ancient times, to a branch of the royal house
which was not the next in lineal succession.Three Kings of the House
of Lancaster reigned by a good parliamentary title, and the doctrine
of indefeasible hereditary right, the doctrine that there was some
virtue in a particular line of succession which the power of Parliament
itself could not set aside, was first brought forward as the formal
justification of the claims of the House of York(37).Those claims
in truth could not be formally justified on any showing but that of
the most slavish doctrine of divine right, but it was not on any such
doctrine as that that the cause of the House of York really rested.The elaborate list of grandmothers and great-grandmothers which was
brought forward to show that Henry the Fifth was an usurper would never
have been heard of if the government of Henry the Sixth had not become
utterly unpopular, while Richard Duke of York was the best beloved man
of his time.Richard accepted a parliamentary compromise, which of
course implied the right of Parliament to decide the question.Henry
was to keep the Crown for life, and Richard was to displace Henry’s
son as heir-apparent.That is to say, according to a custom common in
Germany, though rare in England, Richard was chosen to fill a vacancy
in the throne which had not yet taken place(38).Duke Richard fell at
Wakefield; in the Yorkist reading of the Law the Crown was presently
forfeited by Henry, and Edward, the heir of York, had his claim
acknowledged by a show of popular election which carries us back to
far earlier times.The claim of Richard the Third, whatever we make
of it on other grounds, was acknowledged in the like sort by what had
at least the semblance of a popular Assembly(39).In short, though
the hereditary principle had now taken firm root, though the disputes
between the pretenders to the Crown were mainly disputes as to the
right of succession, yet the remembrance of the days when the Crown
had been truly the gift of the people had not wholly passed away.The last King who could bring even the shadow of a claim to have
been chosen by the voice of the people beneath the canopy of heaven
was no other than Richard the Third.The last King who could bring
a better claim to have been chosen by the same voice beneath the
vault of the West Minster was no other than Henry the Eighth.Down to
his time the old ecclesiastical form of choosing the King remained
in the coronation-service, and it was not wholly out of character
that Henry should issue a _congé d’élire_ for his own election.The
device for Henry’s coronation survives in his own handwriting, and,
while it contains a strong assertion of his hereditary right, it also
contains a distinct provision for his election by the people in ancient
form(40).The claim of Henry was perfectly good, for a Parliament of
his father’s reign had declared that the Crown should abide in Henry
the Seventh and the heirs of his body(41).But it was in his case that
the hereditary and parliamentary claim was confirmed by the ancient
rite of ecclesiastical election for the last time in our history.His
successor was not thus distinctly chosen.This was perhaps, among
other reasons, because in his case the form was specially needless.For the right of Edward the Sixth to succeed his father was beyond
all dispute.By an exercise of parliamentary power, which we may well
deem strange, but which was none the less lawful, Henry had been
entrusted with the power of bequeathing and entailing the Crown as he
thought good.That power he exercised on behalf of his own children in
order, and, failing them and their issue, on the issue of his younger
sister(42).Edward, Mary, Elizabeth, therefore all reigned lawfully by
virtue of their father’s will.A moment’s thought will show that Mary
and Elizabeth could not both reign lawfully according to any doctrine
of hereditary succession.On no theory, Catholic or Protestant, could
both be the legitimate daughters of Henry.Parliament indeed had
declared both to be illegitimate; on any theory one or the other must
have been so(43).But each reigned by a perfectly lawful title, under
the provisions of the Act which empowered their father to settle the
succession according to his pleasure.While Elizabeth reigned, almost
divine as she might be deemed to be in her own person, it was at
least not held that there was any divine right in any other person to
succeed her.The doctrine which came into vogue under her successors
was in her day looked upon as treasonable(44).Elizabeth knew where
her strength lay, and the Stewarts knew where their strength, such
as it was, lay also.In the eye of the Law the first Stewart was an
usurper; he occupied the Crown in the teeth of an Act of Parliament
still in force, though he presently procured a fresh Act to salve
over his usurpation(45).There can be no doubt that, on the death of
Elizabeth, the lawful right to the Crown lay in the house of Suffolk,
the descendants of Henry’s younger sister Mary.But the circumstances
of the time were unfavourable to their claims; by a tacit agreement,
politically convenient, but quite in the teeth of the existing Law, the
Crown silently passed to the King of Scots, the descendant of Henry’s
elder sister Margaret.She had not been named in Henry’s entail; her
descendants therefore, lineal heirs of William and Cerdic as they were,
had no legal claim to the Crown beyond what was given them by the Act
of Parliament which was passed after James was already in possession.They were therefore driven, like the Yorkists at an earlier time, to
patch up the theory of the divine right of hereditary succession, in
order to justify an occupation of the throne which had nothing to
justify it in English Law(46).On one memorable day a Stewart King was reminded that an English King
received his right to reign from the will of the English people.Whatever else we may say of the nature or the acts of the tribunal
before which Charles the First was arraigned, it did but assert the
ancient Law of England when it told how “Charles Stewart was admitted
King of England, and therein trusted with a limited power, to govern
by and according to the laws of the land and not otherwise.” It did
but assert a principle which had been acted on on fitting occasions
for nine hundred years, when it told its prisoner that “all his
predecessors and he were responsible to the Commons of England.”
Forgetful of the fate of Sigeberht and Æthelred, of Edward and of
Richard, Charles ventured to ask for precedents, and told his judges
that “the Kingdom of England was hereditary and not successive”(47).After a season, the intruding dynasty passed away, on that great day
when the English people exercised for the last time its ancient right
of deposing and electing Kings.The Convention of which we have so
often spoken, that great Assembly, irregular in the eyes of lawyers,
but in truth all the more lawful because no King’s writ had summoned
it, cast all fantasies and subtleties to the winds by declaring that
the throne was vacant.A true Assembly of the nation once more put
forth its greatest power, and chose William of Orange, as, six hundred
years before, another Assembly of the nation had chosen Harold the
son of Godwine.The cycle had come round, and the English people had
won back again the rights which their fathers had brought with them
from their old home beyond the sea.Nor was it without fitness that
their choice went back to those kindred lands, and that a new William
crossed the sea to undo, after so many ages, the wrongs which England
had suffered from his namesake.And now, under the rule of an elective
King, England could at last afford to make her Crown strictly and
permanently hereditary.The Act of Settlement, as we all know, entailed
the Crown on the Electress Sophia and her heirs(48).Therefore no
Kings have ever reigned by a better right than those who, by virtue
of that Act, have been called to reign by the direct operation of the
Law.They are in truth Kings—_Cyningas_ in the most ancient sense—whose
power flows directly from the will of the nation.In the existing state
of our institutions, the hereditary character of our modern kingship
is no falling away from ancient principles; it in truth allows us
to make a fuller application of them in another shape.In an early
state of things no form of government is so natural as that which
we find established among our forefathers.A feeling which was not
wholly sentimental demanded that the King should, under all ordinary
circumstances, be the descendant of former Kings.But a sense that
some personal qualification was needed in a ruler required that the
electors should have the right of freely choosing within the royal
house.In days when Kings governed as well as reigned, such a choice,
made with some regard to the personal qualities of the King chosen, was
the best means for securing freedom and good government.Under the rule
of a conventional constitution, when Kings reign but do not govern,
when it is openly professed in the House of Commons that it is to that
House that the powers of government have passed(49), the objects
which were once best secured by making kingship elective are now best
secured by making kingship hereditary.It is as the Spartan King said:
by lessening the powers of the Crown, its possession has become more
lasting(50).A political system like ours would be inconsistent with
an elective kingship.An elective King could not be trusted simply to
reign; he would assuredly govern, or try to govern.We need not suppose
that he would attempt any breaches of the written Law.But those powers
which the written Law attaches to the Crown he would assuredly try to
exercise according to his own personal views of what was right and
expedient.And he would assuredly be justified in so doing.For the
personal choice of a certain man to be King would in all reason be held
to imply that he was personally fit for the work of government.He
would be a President or Prime Minister chosen for life, one whom there
would be no means of removing from office except by the most extreme
and most unusual exercise of the powers of Parliament.There are states
of society in which an elective Monarchy is a better kind of government
than either a Commonwealth or an hereditary Monarchy.But, under the
present circumstances of the civilized states of Europe and America,
the choice lies between the hereditary Monarchy and the Commonwealth.The circumstances of our history have made us an hereditary Monarchy,
just as the circumstances of the history of Switzerland have made that
country a Federal Commonwealth.And no reasonable person will seek to
disturb an institution which, like other English institutions, has
grown up because it was wanted(51).Our unwritten Constitution, which
gives us an hereditary Sovereign, but which requires his government to
be carried on by Ministers who are practically chosen by the House of
Commons, does in effect attain the same objects which were sought to
be attained by the elective kingship of our forefathers.Our system
gives the State a personal chief, a personal embodiment of the national
being, which draws to itself those feelings of personal homage and
personal duty which a large class of mankind find it hard to look
upon as due to the more abstract ideas of Law and Commonwealth.And,
when the duties of constitutional royalty are discharged as our own
experience tells us that they may be discharged, the feeling awakened
is more than a mere sentiment; it is a rational feeling of genuine
personal respect.But widely as the hereditary kingship of our latest
times differs in outward form from the hereditary kingship of our
earliest times, the two have points of likeness which are not shared by
kingship in the form which it took in the ages between the two.In our
earliest and in our latest system, the King exists for the sake of the
people; in the intermediate times it sometimes seemed that the people
existed for the sake of the King.In our earliest and in our latest
system, the King is clothed with an office, the duties of which are to
be discharged for the common good of all.In the intermediate times it
sometimes seemed as if the King had been made master of a possession
which was to be enjoyed for his personal pleasure and profit.In the
intermediate times we constantly hear of the rights and powers of the
Crown as something distinct from, and almost hostile to, the common
rights of the people.In our earliest and in our latest times, the
rights of the Crown and the rights of the people are the same, for it
is allowed that the powers of the Crown are to be exercised for the
welfare of the people by the advice and consent of the people or their
representatives.Without indulging in any Utopian dreams, without
picturing to ourselves the England of a thousand years back as an
earthly paradise, the voice of sober history does assuredly teach us
that those distant times have really much in common with our own, much
in which we are really nearer to them than to times which, in a mere
reckoning of years, are far less distant from us.Thus it is that the
cycle has come round, that the days of foreign rule have been wiped
out, and that England is England once again.Our present Sovereign
reigns by as good a right as Ælfred or Harold, for she reigns by the
same right by which they reigned, by the will of the people, embodied
in the Act of Parliament which made the crown of Ælfred and Harold
hereditary in her ancestress.And, reigning by the same right by which
they reigned, she reigns also for the same ends, for the common good
of the nation of which the Law has made her the head.And we can
wish nothing better for her kingdom than that the Crown which she so
lawfully holds, which she has so worthily worn among two generations
of her people, she may, like Nestor of old, continue to wear amid the
well-deserved affection of a third(52).(1) What I say of Uri and the other democratic Cantons must not be
misunderstood, as if I all accepted the now exploded dreams which
made out the _Waldstädte_ or Forest Cantons to have had some special
origin, and some special independence, apart from the rest of Germany.The researches of modern scholars have shown, not only that the
Forest Cantons were members of the Empire like their neighbours, but
that various lesser lords, spiritual and temporal, held different
rights within them.Their acquisition of perfect independence, even
their deliverance from other lords and promotion to the state of
_Reichsunmittelbarkeit_ or immediate dependence on the Empire, was a
work of time.Thus Uri itself, or part of it, was granted in 853 by
Lewis the German to the Abbey of Nuns (_Fraumünster_) in Zürich, and
it was not till 1231 that its independence of any lord but the Emperor
was formally acknowledged.But the universal supremacy of the Empire
in no way interfered with the internal constitution of any district,
city, or principality; nor was such interference necessarily implied
even in subjection to some intermediate lord.The rule of a female
monastery especially would be very light.And from the earliest times
we find both the men of Uri in general and the men of particular parts
of the district (_Gemeinden_, _Communes_, or parishes) spoken of as
communities capable of acting together, and even of treating with those
who claimed to be their masters.(“Nos inhabitantes Uroniam” appear in
a deed of 955 as capable of making an agreement with the officer of the
Abbey at Zürich.)All this is in no way peculiar to the Forest Cantons;
it is no more than what we find everywhere; what is peculiar is that,
whereas elsewhere the old local communities gradually died out, in the
Forest Cantons they lived and flourished, and gained new rights and
powers till they grew into absolutely independent commonwealths.I
think therefore that I have a right to speak of the democracy of Uri as
immemorial.It is not immemorial in its fully developed shape, but that
fully developed shape grew step by step out of earlier forms which are
strictly immemorial and common to the whole Teutonic race.On the early history of the democratic Cantons, a subject than which
none has been more thoroughly misunderstood, I am not able to point
to any one trustworthy work in English.Among the writings of Swiss
scholars—shut up for the most part from readers of other nations in the
inaccessible Transactions of local Societies—there is a vast literature
on the subject, of the whole of which I am far from pretending to be
master.But I may refer to the _Essai sur l’Etat des Personnes et la
Condition des Terres dans le Pays d’Ury au XIIIe Siècle_, by the Baron
Frederick de Gingins-la-Sarraz, in the _Archiv für schweizerische
Geschichte_, i.J. R. Burckhardt’s _Untersuchungen über
die erste Bevölkerung des Alpengebirgs_ in the same collection, iv.3; to the early chapters of the great work of Bluntschli, _Geschichte
des schweizerischen Bundesrechtes_ (Zürich, 1849), and of Blumer’s
_Staats-und Rechtsgeschichte der schweizerischen Demokratien_ (St.Alfons Huber, _Die Waldstaette_ (Innsbruck,
1861), and Dr.Wilhelm Vischer, _Die Sage von der Befreiung der
Waldstädte_ (Leipzig, 1867).H. von Liebenau, in _Die Tell-Sage
zu dem Jahre_ 1230, takes a line of his own.The results of the
whole inquiry will be found in the most accessible form in M. Albert
Rilliet’s _Les Origines de la Confédération Suisse_ (Genève et Bâle,
1868).(2) Individual Swiss mercenaries may doubtless still be found in
foreign armies, as Italy some years back knew to her cost.But the
Federal Constitution of 1848 altogether swept away the system of
military capitulations which used to be publicly entered into by the
Cantons.(3) See Johannes von Müller, _Geschichte der schweizerische
Eidgenossenschaft_, Book v., c.25, of his _sämmtliche
Werke_, Stuttgart und Tübingen, 1832, and the note in vol.14;
or the French translation, vol.The description in Peterman Etterlin’s Chronicle, p.204 (Basel, 1752),
is worth quoting in the original.“Dann do der Hertzog von Burgunn
gesach den züg den berg ab züchen, schein die sunn gerad in sy, und
glitzet als wie ein spiegel, des gelichen lüyet das horn von Ury,
auch die harschorne von Lutzern, und was ein sölich toffen, das des
Hertzogen von Burgunn lüt ein grusen darab entpfiengent, und trattent
hinder sich.”

(4) The magistrates rode when I was present at the Landesgemeinden of
1863 and 1864.I trust that so good a custom has not passed away.(5) On the character and position of Phôkiôn, see Grote, xi.481; and on the general question of the alleged fickleness of the
Athenian people, see iv.(6) Some years ago I went through all the elections to the _Bundesrath_
or Executive Council in Switzerland, and found that in eighteen years
it had only twice happened that a member of the Council seeking
reelection had failed to obtain it.I therefore think that I was
right in congratulating a member of the Federal Council, whom I had the
pleasure of meeting last year, on being a member of the most permanent
government in Europe.(7) Under the so-called Helvetic Republic of 1798, the Cantons ceased
to be sovereign States, and became mere divisions, like counties or
departments.One of the earliest provisions of this constitution
abolishes the ancient democracies of the Forest Cantons.“Die
Regierungsform, wenn sie auch sollte verändert werden, soll allezeit
eine repräsentative Demokratie sein.” (See the text in Bluntschli, ii.The “repräsentative Demokratie” thus forced on these ancient
commonwealths by the sham democrats of Paris was meant to exclude the
pure democracy of Athens and Uri.The Federal system was in some sort restored by the Act of Mediation
(_Vermittlungsakte_) of Napoleon Buonaparte, when First Consul in 1803.See the text in Bluntschli, ii.(8) Appenzell, though its history had long been connected with that
of the Confederates, was not actually admitted as a Canton till
December 1513, being the youngest of the thirteen Cantons which
formed the Confederation down to 1798.See Zellweger, _Geschichte des
Appenzellischen Volkes_, ii.366, and the text in his _Urkunden_,
ii.481, or in the older _Appenzeller Chronick_ of
Walser (Saint Gallen, 1740), 410, and the Act in his _Anhang_, p.The frontispiece of this volume contains a lively picture of
a _Landesgemeinde_.In 1597 the Canton was divided into the two
Half-cantons of _Ausser-Rhoden_, Protestant, and _Inner-Rhoden_,
Catholic.(9) On armed assemblies see Norman Conquest, ii.(10) I perhaps need hardly insist on this point after the references
given in my first note; but I find it constantly needful to explain
that there is no such thing as a Swiss _nation_ in any but a political
sense.The Cantons were simply members of the Empire which gradually
won a greater independence than their fellows.And the Forest Cantons,
and the German-speaking Swiss generally, do not even form a distinct
part of the German nation; they are simply three settlements of the
Alemanni, just as the three divisions of Lincolnshire are three
settlements of the Angles.(11) The earliest instance that I know of the use of the word
_Englaland_ is in the Treaty with Olaf and Justin in 991.Its earliest
use in the English Chronicles is in 1014.78, 276, 605, 629.The oldest use that I know of the name Yorkshire
(_Eoforwicscír_) is in the Chronicles under 1065.Deira is, of course, as old as Gregory the Great’s pun.(12) The real history of English parishes has yet to be worked out.I
feel sure that they will be found to have much more in common with the
continental _Gemeinden_ than would seem at first sight.Some hints may
be found in a little pamphlet which I lately came across, called “The
Parish in History.”

(13) The nature of democracy is set forth by Periklês in the Funeral
Oration, Thucydides, ii.37: ὄνομα μὲν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἐς ὀλίγους ἀλλ' ἐς
πλείονας οἰκεῖν δημοκρατία κέκληται· μέτεστι δὲ κατὰ μὲν τοὺς νόμους
πρὸς τὰ ἴδια διάφορα πᾶσι τὸ ἴσον, κατὰ δὲ τὴν ἀξίωσιν ὡς ἕκαστος
ἐν τῷ εὐδοκιμεῖ.It is set forth still more clearly by Athênagoras
of Syracuse, vi.39, where the functions of different classes in a
democracy are clearly distinguished: ἐγὼ δέ φημι πρῶτα μὲν δῆμον
ξύμπαν ὠνομάσθαι, ὀλιγαρχίαν δὲ μέρος, ἔπειτα φύλακας μὲν ἀρίστους
εἶναι χρημάτων τοὺς πλουσίους, βουλεῦσαι δ' ἂν βέλτιστα τοὺς ξυνετοὺς,
κρῖναι δ' ἂν ἀκούσαντας ἄριστα τοὺς πολλοὺς, καὶ ταῦτα ὁμοίως καὶ κατὰ
μέρη καὶ ξύμπαντα ἐν δημοκρατίᾳ ἰσομοιρεῖν.Here a distinct sphere
is assigned both to wealth and to special intelligence.Nearly the
same division is drawn by a writer who might by comparison be called
aristocratic.29) holds that the management of public
affairs should be immediately in the hands of the men of wealth and
leisure, who should act as servants of the People, the People itself
being their master—or, as he does not scruple to say, _Tyrant_—with
full power of reward and punishment: ἐκεῖνοι διεγνωκότες ἦσαν ὅτι δεῖ
τὸν μὲν δῆμον ὥσπερ τύραννον καθιστάναι τὰς ἀρχὰς καὶ κολάζειν τοὺς
ἐξαμαρτάνοντας καὶ κρίνειν περὶ τῶν ἀμφισβητουμένων, τοὺς δὲ σχολὴν
ἄγειν δυναμένους καὶ βίον ἱκανὸν κεκτημένους ἐπιμελεῖσθαι τῶν κοινῶν
ὥσπερ οἰκέτας, καὶ δικαίους μὲν γενομένους ἐπαινεῖσθαι καὶ στέργειν
ταύτῃ τῇ τιμῇ, κακῶς δὲ διοικήσαντας μηδεμιᾶς συγγνώμης τυγχάνειν,
ἀλλὰ ταῖς μεγίσταις ζημίαις περιπίπτειν.This he elsewhere (Panath
166) calls democracy with a mixture of aristocracy—not oligarchy.(τὴν
δημοκρατίαν τὴν ἀριστοκρατίᾳ μεμιγμένην).The unfavourable meaning which is often attached to the word democracy,
when it does not arise from simple ignorance, probably arises from
the use of the word by Aristotle.7) three
lawful forms of government, _kingship_ (βασιλεία), _aristocracy_
(ἀριστοκρατία), and what he calls specially πολιτεία or _commonwealth_.Of these he makes three corruptions, _tyranny_, _oligarchy_, and
_democracy_ (τυραννίς, ὀλιγαρχία, δημοκρατία), defining _democracy_ to
be a government carried on for the special benefit of the poor (πρὸς τὸ
συμφέρον τὸ τῶν ἀπόρων).In this there is something of a philosopher’s
contempt for all popular government, and it is certain that Aristotle’s
way of speaking is not that which is usual in the Greek historians.Polybios, like Herodotus and Thucydides, uses the word democracy in
the old honourable sense, and he takes (ii.38) as his special type of
democracy the constitution of the Achaian League, which certainly had
in it a strong element of practical aristocracy (see History of Federal
Government, cap.): ἰσηγορίας καὶ παρρησίας καὶ καθόλου δημοκρατίας
ἀληθινῆς σύστημα καὶ προαίρεσιν εἰλικρινεστέραν οὐκ ἂν εὕροι τις τῆς
παρὰ τοῖς Ἀχαιοῖς ὑπαρχούσης.In short, what Aristotle calls πολιτεία
Polybios calls δημοκρατία; what Aristotle calls δημοκρατία Polybios
calls ὀχλοκρατία.(14) It follows that, when the commonwealth of Florence disfranchised
the whole of the noble families, it lost its right to be called a
democracy.See the passing of the Ordinance of Justice in Sismondi,
Républiques Italiennes, iv.65; Chroniche di Giovanni Villani, viii.(15) On Slavery in England, see Norman Conquest, i.81, 333, 368,
432, iv.For fuller accounts, see Kemble’s Saxons in England,
i.185; Zöpfl, _Geschichte der deutschen Rechtsinstitute_, 62.The
three classes of nobles, common freemen, and slaves cannot be better
set forth than in the Life of Saint Lebuin (Pertz, ii.361): “Sunt
denique ibi, qui illorum lingua edlingi, sunt qui frilingi, sunt qui
lassi dicuntur, quod in Latina sonat lingua, nobiles, ingenuiles, atque
serviles.”

(16) On the _Wite-þeow_, the slave reduced to slavery for his crimes,
see Kemble, Saxons in England, i.He is mentioned several times in
the laws of Ine, 24, 48, 54, where, as usual in the West-Saxon laws, a
distinction is drawn between the English and the Welsh _wite-þeow_.The
second reference contains a provision for the case of a newly enslaved
_þeow_ who should be charged with a crime committed before he was
condemned to slavery.(17) I wish to leave the details of Eastern matters to Eastern
scholars.But there are several places in the Old Testament where
we see something very much like a general assembly, combined with
distinctions of rank among its members, and with the supremacy of a
single chief over all.Ζεὺς δὲ Θέμιστα κέλευσε θεοὺς ἀγορήνδε καλέσσαι
          Κρατὸς ἄπ' Οὐλύμποιο πολυπτύχου· ἡ δ’ ἄρα πάντη
          Φοιτήσασα κέλευσε Διὸς πρὸς δῶμα νέεσθαι.Οὔτε τις οὖν Ποταμῶν ἀπέην, νόσφ' Ὠκεανοῖο,
          Οὔτ' ἄρα Νυμφάων ταί τ' ἄλσεα καλὰ νέμονται,
          Καὶ πηγὰς ποταμῶν, καὶ πίσεα ποιήεντα.Besides the presence of the Nymphs in the divine _Mycel Gemót_,
something might also be said about the important position of Hêrê,
Athênê, and other female members of the inner council.We find the mortal Assembly described at length in the second book of
the Iliad, and indeed by implication at the very beginning of the first
book.(19) We hear the applause of the assembly in i.333, and in
the Trojan Assembly, xviii.(20) On the whole nature of the Homeric ἀγορή see Gladstone’s Homer and
the Homeric Age, iii.Gladstone has to my thinking understood
the spirit of the old Greek polity much better than Mr.(21) There is no need to go into any speculations as to the early
Roman Constitution, as to the origin of the distinction of _patres_
and _plebs_, or any of the other points about which controversies
have raged among scholars.The three elements stand out in every
version, legendary and historical.8, Romulus first holds
his general Assembly and then chooses his Senate.26 we get
the distinct appeal from the King, or rather from the magistrates
acting by his authority, to an Assembly which, whatever might be its
constitution, is more popular than the Senate.(22) It is hardly needful to show how the Roman Consuls simply stepped
into the place of the Kings.It is possible, as some have thought, that
the revolution threw more power into patrician hands than before, but
at all events the Senate and the Assembly go on just as before.(23) Tacitus, de Moribus Germaniæ, c.7-13:

“Reges ex nobilitate; Duces ex virtute sumunt.Nec Regibus infinita aut
libera potestas; et Duces exemplo potius quam imperio: si prompti, si
conspicui, si ante aciem agant, admiratione præsunt.... De minoribus
rebus Principes consultant; de majoribus omnes; ita tamen ut ea quoque
quorum penes plebem arbitrium est apud Principes pertractentur....
Ut turbæ placuit, considunt armati.Silentium per Sacerdotes, quibus
tum et coercendi jus est, imperatur.Mox Rex, vel Princeps, prout
ætas cuique, prout nobilitas, prout decus bellorum, prout facundia
est audiuntur, auctoritate suadendi magis quam jubendi potestate.Si displicuit sententia, fremitu adspernantur; sin placuit, frameas
concutiunt.Honoratissimum adsensûs genus est, armis laudare.Licet
apud concilium adcusare quoque et discrimen capitis intendere....
Eliguntur in iisdem conciliis et Principes, qui jura per pagos vicosque
reddant.Centeni singulis ex plebe comites, consilium simul et
auctoritas, adsunt.Nihil autem neque publicæ neque privatæ rei nisi
armati agunt.”

Essays, p.(28) On _Eorlas_ and _Ceorlas_ I have said something in the History
of the Norman Conquest, i.See the two words in Schmid, and the
references there given.(29) On the Barons of Attinghausen, see Blumer, _Staats- und
Rechtsgeschichte der schweizerischen Demokratien_, i.(30) I cannot at this moment lay my hand on my authority for this
curious, and probably mythical, custom, but it is equally good as an
illustration any way.(31) This custom is described by Diodôros, i.The priest first
recounted the good deeds of the King and attributed to him all possible
virtues; then he invoked a curse for whatever has been done wrongfully,
absolving the King from all blame and praying that the vengeance might
fall on his ministers who had suggested evil things (τὸ τελευταῖον
ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀγνοουμένων ἀρὰν ἐποιεῖτο, τὸν μὲν βασιλέα τῶν ἐγκλημάτων
ἐξαιρούμενος, εἰς δὲ τοὺς ὑπηρετοῦντας καὶ διδάξαντας τὰ φαῦλα καὶ τὴν
βλαβὴν καὶ τὴν τιμωρίαν ἀξιῶν ἀποσκῆψαι).He wound up with some moral
and religious advice.25) distinguishes “eæ gentes quæ regnantur” from
others.And in 43 he speaks of “erga Reges obsequium” as characteristic
of some particular tribes: see Norman Conquest, i.(33) On the use of the words _Ealdorman_ and _Heretoga_, see Norman
Conquest, i.583, and the passages in Kemble and Allen
there referred to.(35) See Kemble’s Saxons in England, i.152, and Massmann’s Ulfilas,
744.(36) See the words _driht_, _drihten_ in Bosworth’s Anglo-Saxon
Dictionary.(37) To say nothing of other objections to this derivation, its author
must have fancied that _ing_ and not _end_ was the ending of the
Old-English participle.The mistake is as old as Sir Thomas Smith.I am
afraid of meddling with Sanscrit, but it strikes me that the views
of Allen and Kemble are not inconsistent with a connexion with the
Sanscrit _Ganaka_.As one of the curiosities of etymology, it is worth
noticing that Mr.Wedgwood makes the word “probably identical with
Tartar _chan_.”

(39) We read in the Chronicles, 449, how, on the first Jutish landing
in Kent, “heora _heretogan_ wæron twegen gebroðra Hengest and Horsa.”
It is only in 455, on the death of Horsa, that “æfter Þam Hengest feng
to _rice_ and Æsc his sunu”; and in 488, seemingly on the death of
Hengest, “Æsc feng to _rice_ and was xxiiii wintra Cantwara _cyning_.”
So among the West-Saxons, in 495, “coman twegen _ealdormen_ on Brytene,
Cerdic and Cynric his sunu.” It is only in 519 that we read “her Cerdic
and Cynric West-Sexena _rice_ onfengun.”

(40) The distinction between Kings and Jarls comes out very strongly
in the account of the battle of Ashdown (Æscesdune) in the Chronicles
in 871.The Danes “wæron on twam gefylcum, on oþrum wæs Bagsecg and
Healfdene, þa hæðenan _cingas_ and on oðrum wæron þa _eorlas_.” It may
be marked that in the English army King Æthelred is set against the
Danish Kings, and his brother the Ætheling Ælfred against the Jarls.So
in the Song of Brunanburh we read of the five Kings and seven Jarls who
were slain.“Fife lagon          sweordum aswefede,
   on ðæm campstede    swilce seofone eac
   ciningas geonge,    eorlas Anlafes.”

We may mark that the Kings were young, as if they had been chosen
“ex nobilitate;” nothing is said of the age of the Jarls, who were
doubtless chosen “ex virtute.”

(41) I have quoted the passage from Bæda about the satraps in Norman
Conquest, i.The passage in the Life of Saint Lebuin, quoted in
note 15, also speaks of “principes” as presiding over the several
_pagi_ or _gauen_, but he speaks of no King or other common chief over
the whole country.And this is the more to be marked, as there was a
“generale concilium” of the whole Old-Saxon nation, formed, as we are
told, of twelve chosen men from each _gau_.This looks like an early
instance of representation, but it should be remembered that we are
here dealing with a constitution strictly Federal.In the like sort we find the rulers of the West-Goths at the time of
their crossing the Danube spoken of as _Judices_.See Ammianus, xxvii.5, and the notes of Lindenbrog and Valesius.So also Gibbon, c. xxv.So Jornandes(26) speaks of “primates eorum, et
duces, qui regum vice illis præerant.” Presently he calls Fredigern
“Gothorum regulus,” like the _subreguli_ or _under-cyningas_ of our own
History.28 Athanaric, the successor of Fredigern, is
pointedly called _Rex_.On all this, see Allen, Royal Prerogative, 163.(43) The best instance in English History of the process by which a
kingdom changed into a province, by going through the intermediate
stage of a half-independent Ealdormanship, is to be found in the
history of South-Western Mercia under its Ealdorman Æthelred and the
Lady Æthelflæd, in the reigns of Ælfred and Eadward the Elder.(45) Iliad, ix.160:—

       καὶ μοὶ ὑποστήτω, ὅσσον β α σ ι λ ε ύ τ ε ρ ό ς ἐιμι.(46) The instances in which a great kingdom has been broken up into a
number of small states practically independent, but owning a nominal
superiority in the successor of the original Sovereign, are not few.In the case of the Empire I have found something to say about it in my
Historical Essays, 151, and in the case of the Caliphate in my History
and Conquest of the Saracens, 137.How the same process took place with
the Mogul Empire in India is set forth by Lord Macaulay in his Essays
on Lord Clive and Warren Hastings.But he should not have compared
the great Mogul, with his nominal sovereignty, to “the most helpless
driveller among the later Carlovingians,” a class whom Sir Francis
Palgrave has rescued from undeserved contempt.But the breaking up of
the Western Kingdom is none the less an example of the same law.The
most remarkable thing is the way, or rather the three different ways,
in which the scattered members have been brought together again in
Germany, Italy, and France.This process of dismemberment, where a nominal supremacy is still kept
by the original Sovereign, must be distinguished from that of falling
back upon Dukes or Ealdormen after a period of kingly rule.In this
latter case it would seem that no central sovereignty went on.(47) At this time of day I suppose it is hardly necessary to prove the
elective character of Old-English kingship.I have said what I have
to say about it in Norman Conquest, i.But I may quote one
most remarkable passage from the report made in 787 to Pope Hadrian the
First by George and Theophylact, his Legates in England (Haddan and
Stubbs, Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents, iii.“Sanximus
ut in ordinatione Regum nullus permittat pravorum prævalere assensum:
sed legitime Reges a sacerdotibus et senioribus populi eligantur.”
One would like to know who the “pravi” here denounced were.The
passage sounds very like a narrowing of the franchise or some other
interference with freedom of election, but in any case it bears witness
to the elective character of our ancient kingship, and to the general
popular character of the constitution.(48) I have described the powers of the Witan, as I understand them
and as they were understood by Mr.108 of the
History of the Norman Conquest and in some of the Appendices to that
volume.With regard to the powers of the Witan, I find no difference
between my own views and those of Professor Stubbs in the Introductory
Sketch to his Select Charters (p.11), where the relations between
the King and the Witan, and the general character of our ancient
constitution, are set forth with wonderful power and clearness.Stubbs and myself differing altogether as to the constitution
of the Witenagemót.I look upon it as an Assembly of the whole kingdom,
after the type of the smaller assemblies of the shire and other lesser
divisions.Stubbs fully admits the popular character of the smaller
assemblies, but denies any such character to the national gathering.It
is dangerous to set oneself up against the greatest master of English
constitutional history, but I must ask the reader to weigh what I say
in note Q in the Appendix to my first volume.(49) I have collected some of the instances of deposition in
Northumberland in the note following that on the constitution of the
Witenagemót.It is not at all unlikely that
the report of George and Theophylact quoted above may have a special
reference to the frequent changes among the Northumbrian Kings.(50) I have mentioned all the instances at vol.105 of the Norman
Conquest: Sigeberht, Æthelred, Harthacnut, Edward the Second, Richard
the Second, James the Second.It is remarkable that nearly all are
the second of their respective names; for, besides Æthelred, Edward,
Richard, and James, Harthacnut might fairly be called Cnut the Second.(51) Tacitus, De Moribus Germaniæ, 13, 14:—“Nec rubor inter comites
adspici.Gradus quinetiam et ipse comitatus habet, judicio ejus quem
sectantur; magnaque et comitum æmulatio quibus primus apud Principem
suum locus; et Principum cui plurimi et acerrimi comites.... Quum
ventum in aciem, turpe Principi virtute vinci, turpe comitatui virtutem
Principis non adæquare.Jam vero infame in omnem vitam ac probrosum,
superstitem Principi suo ex acie recessisse.Illum defendere, tueri,
sua quoque fortia facta gloriæ ejus adsignare, præcipuum sacramentum
est.Principes pro victoria pugnant; comites pro Principe.” See Allen,
Royal Prerogative, 142.(52) The original text of the Song of Maldon will be found in Thorpe’s
Analecta Anglo-Saxonica.My extracts are made from the modern English
version which I attempted in my Old-English History, p.I went
on the principle of altering the Old-English text no more than was
actually necessary to make it intelligible.When a word has altogether
dropped out of our modern language, I have of course changed it; when
a word is still in use, in however different a sense, I have kept it.Many words which were anciently used in a physical sense are now used
only metaphorically; thus “cringe” is used in one of the extracts in
its primary meaning of bowing or falling down, and therefore of dying.(53) The history of the Roman clientship is another of those points on
which legend and history and ingenious modern speculation all come to
much the same, as far as our present purpose is concerned.Whether the
clients were the same as the _plebs_ or not, at any rate no patricians
entered into the client relation, and this at once supplies the
contrast with Teutonic institutions.(54) The title of _dominus_, implying a master of slaves, was always
refused by the early Emperors.This is recorded of Augustus by
Suetonius (Aug.12), and still more distinctly of
Tiberius (Suetonius, Tib.Tiberius also refused
the title of _Imperator_, except in its strictly military sense:
οὔτε γὰρ δεσπότην ἑαυτὸν τοῖς ἐλευθέροις οὔτε αὐτοκράτορα πλὴν τοῖς
στρατιώταις καλεῖν ἐφίει.Caius is said (Aurelius Victor, Cæs.4) to have been called _dominus_, and there is no doubt about Domitian
(Suetonius, Dom.13, where see Reimar’s Note).Pliny
in his letters constantly addresses Trajan as _dominus_; yet in his
Panegyric(45) he draws the marked distinction: “Scis, ut sunt diversa
natura dominatio et principatus, ita non aliis esse principem gratiorem
quam qui maxime dominum graventur.” This marks the return to older
feelings and customs under Trajan.The final and formal establishment
of the title seems to have come in with the introduction of Eastern
ceremonies under Diocletian (see the passage already referred to in
Aurelius Victor).It is freely used by the later Panegyrists, as
for instance Eumenius, iv.13: “Domine Constanti,” “Domine
Maximiane, Imperator æterne,” and so forth.(55) Vitellius (Tac.58) was the first to employ Roman knights
in offices hitherto always filled by freedmen; but the system was not
fully established till the time of Hadrian (Spartianus, Hadrian, 22).89, 587, and the passages here quoted.(57) Both _hlàford_ and _hlæfdige_ (_Lord_ and _Lady_) are very
puzzling words as to the origin of their later syllables.It is enough
for my purpose if the connexion of the first syllable with _hlàf_ be
allowed.Different as is the origin of the two words, _hlàford_ always
translates _dominus_.The French _seigneur_, and the corresponding
forms in Italian and Spanish, come from the Latin _senior_, used as
equivalent to _dominus_.This is one of the large class of words which
are analogous to our _Ealdorman_.(58) This is fully treated by Palgrave, English Commonwealth, i.(59) On the change from the _alod_, _odal_, or _eðel_, a man’s very own
property, to the land held of a lord, see Hallam, Middle Ages, i.Kemble in his chapter on the Noble by Service, Saxons in England, i.(61) See the whole history and meaning of the word in the article
_þegen_ in Schmid’s Glossary.(63) Barbour, Bruce, i.fredome is A noble thing.”

So said Herodotus (v.78) long before:

   ἡ ἰσηγορίη ὡς ἔστι χρῆμα σπουδαῖον.(1) In the great poetical manifesto of the patriotic party in Henry the
Third’s reign, printed in Wright’s Political Songs of England (Camden
Society, 1839), there seems to be no demand whatever for new laws, but
only for the declaration and observance of the old.Thus, the passage
which I have chosen for one of my mottoes runs on thus:—

  “Igitur communitas regni consulatur;
   Et quid universitas sentiat sciatur,
   Cui leges propriæ maxime sunt notæ.Nec cuncti provinciæ sic sunt idiotæ,
   Quin sciant plus cæteris regni sui mores,
   Quos relinquant posteris hii qui sunt priores.Qui reguntur legibus magis ipsas sciunt;
   Quorum sunt in usibus plus periti fiunt;
   Et quia res agitur sua, plus curabunt,
   Et quo pax adquiritur sibi procurabunt.”

(2) On the renewal of the Laws of Eadward by William, see Norman
Conquest, iv.It should be marked that the
Laws of Eadward were again confirmed by Henry the First (see Stubbs,
90-99), and, as the Great Charter grew out of the Charter of Henry
the First produced by Archbishop Stephen Langton in 1213, the descent
of the Charter from the Laws of Eadward is very simple.See Roger of
Wendover, iii.The Primate there distinctly says that
he had made John swear to renew the Laws of Eadward.“Audistis quomodo,
tempore quo apud Wintoniam Regem absolvi, ipsum jurare compulerim, quod
leges iniquas destrueret et leges bonas, videlicet leges Eadwardi,
revocaret et in regno faceret ab omnibus observari.” It must be
remembered that the phrase of the Laws of Eadward or of any other King
does not really mean a code of laws of that King’s drawing up, but
simply the way of administering the Law, and the general political
condition, which existed in that King’s reign.This is all that would
be meant by the renewal of the Laws of Eadward in William’s time.It
simply meant that William was to rule as his English predecessors had
ruled before him.But, by the time of John, men had no doubt begun to
look on the now canonized Eadward as a lawgiver, and to fancy that
there was an actual code of laws of his to be put in force.On the various confirmations of the Great Charter, see Hallam, Middle
Ages, ii.“When they were told that there was no precedent
for declaring the throne vacant, they produced from among the records
of the Tower a roll of parchment, near three hundred years old, on
which, in quaint characters and barbarous Latin, it was recorded that
the Estates of the Realm had declared vacant the throne of a perfidious
and tyrannical Plantagenet.” See more at large in the debate of the
Conference between the Houses, ii.(4) See Kemble, Saxons in England, ii.This, it will be
remembered, is admitted by Professor Stubbs.See above, note 48 to
Chapter I.(6) I have collected these passages in my History of the Norman
Conquest, i.(7) On the acclamations of the Assembly, see note 19 to Chapter I. I
suspect that in all early assemblies, and not in that of Sparta only,
κρίνουσι βοῇ καὶ οὐ ψήφῳ (Thuc.We still retain the custom in
the cry of “Aye” and “No,” from which the actual vote is a mere appeal,
just like the division ordered by Sthenelaïdas when he professed not to
know on which side the shout was.100, and History of Federal Government, i.In this case the Chronicler, under
the year 1086, distinguishes two classes in the Assembly, “his witan
and ealle Þa landsittende men Þe ahtes wæron ofer eall Engleland.”
These “landsittende men” were evidently the forerunners of the “libere
tenentes,” who, whether their holdings were great or small, kept their
place in the early Parliaments.140-146, where will be
found many passages showing the still abiding traces of the popular
constitution of the Assembly.(10) The practice of summoning particular persons can be traced up to
very early times.202, for instances in the reign of
Æthelstan.On its use in later times, see Hallam, ii.254-260; and on
the irregularity in the way of summoning the spiritual peers, ii.The bearing of these precedents on the question of life peerages
will be seen by any one who goes through Sir T. E. May’s summary,
Constitutional History, i.(11) Sismondi, Histoire des Français, v.289: “Ce roi, le plus absolu
entre ceux qui ont porté la couronne de France, le moins occupé du
bien de ses peuples, le moins consciencieux dans son observation des
droits établis avant lui, est cependant le restaurateur des assemblées
populaires de la France, et l’auteur de la représentation des communes
dans les états généraux.” See Historical Essays, 45.(12) See the history of Stephen Martel in Sismondi, Histoire des
Français, vol.ix., and the account of the dominion of
the Butchers, vii.259, and more at large in Thierry’s History of the
Tiers-État, capp.(13) The Parliament of Paris, though it had its use as some small check
on the mere despotism of the Crown, can hardly come under the head of
free institutions.France, as France, under the old state of things,
cannot be said to have kept any free institutions at all; the only
traces of freedom were to be found in the local Estates which still met
in several of the provinces.See De Tocqueville, Ancien Régime, 347.(14) The thirteenth century was the time when most of the existing
states and nations of Europe took something like their present form and
constitution.The great powers which had hitherto, in name at least,
divided the Christian and Mahometan world, the Eastern and Western
Empires and the Eastern and Western Caliphates, may now be looked on
as practically coming to an end.England, France, and Spain began to
take something like their present shape, and to show the beginnings of
the characteristic position and policy of each.The chief languages of
Western Europe grew into something like their modern form.In short,
the character of this age as a time of beginnings and endings might be
traced out in detail through the most part of Europe and Asia.Pauli does not scruple to give him this title in his admirable
monograph, “_Simon von Montfort Graf von Leicester, der Schöpfer des
Hauses der Gemeinen_.” The career of the Earl should be studied in this
work, and in Mr.Blaauw’s “Barons’ War.”

(16)                “Numquam libertas gratior exstat
      Quam sub rege pio.”—Claudian, ii.“England owes her escape from such calamities
to an event which her historians have generally represented as
disastrous.Her interest was so directly opposed to the interest of her
rulers that she had no hope but in their errors and misfortunes.The
talents and even the virtues of her six first French Kings were a curse
to her.The follies and vices of the seventh were her salvation....
England, which, since the battle of Hastings, had been ruled generally
by wise statesmen, always by brave soldiers, fell under the dominion
of a trifler and a coward.The Norman nobles were compelled to make
their election between the island and the continent.Shut up by the sea
with the people whom they had hitherto oppressed and despised, they
gradually came to regard England as their country, and the English as
their countrymen.The two races so long hostile, soon found that they
had common interests and common enemies.Both were alike aggrieved by
the tyranny of a bad King.Both were alike indignant at the favour
shown by the court to the natives of Poitou and Aquitaine.The great
grandsons of those who had fought under William and the great grandsons
of those who had fought under Harold began to draw near to each other
in friendship; and the first pledge of their reconciliation was the
Great Charter, won by their united exertions, and framed for their
common benefit.”

(18) I have tried to work out the gradual character of the transfer of
lands and offices under William in various parts of the fourth volume
of my History of the Norman Conquest; see especially p.The popular notion of a general scramble for everything gives a most
false view of William’s whole character and position.(20) This is distinctly asserted in the Dialogus de Scaccario (i.10),
under Henry the Second: “Jam cohabitantibus Anglicis et Normannis,
et alterutrum uxores ducentibus vel nubentibus, sic permixtæ sunt
nationes, ut vix discerni possit hodie, de liberis loquor, quis
Anglicus quis Normannus sit genere; exceptis duntaxat ascriptitiis qui
villani dicuntur, quibus non est liberum obstantibus dominis suis a sui
statûs conditione discedere.”

(21) The Angevin family are commonly known as the Plantagenets; but
that name was never used as a surname till the fifteenth century.The name is sometimes convenient, but it is not a really correct
description, like Tudor and Stewart, both of which were real surnames,
borne by the two families before they came to the Crown.In the
almanacks the Angevins are called “The Saxon line restored,” a name
which gives a false idea, though there can be no doubt that Henry the
Second was fully aware of the advantages to be drawn from his remote
female descent from the Old-English Kings.The point to be borne in
mind is that the accession of Henry is the beginning of a distinct
dynasty which could not be called either Norman or English in any but
the most indirect way.(22) I do not remember anything in any of the writers of Henry the
Second’s time to justify the popular notions about “Normans and
Saxons” as two distinct and hostile bodies.Nor do we as yet hear many
complaints of favour being shown to absolute foreigners in preference
to either, though it is certain that many high preferments, especially
in the Church, were held by men who were not English in either sense.The peculiar position of Henry the Second was something like that of
the Emperor Charles the Fifth, that of a prince ruling over a great
number of distinct states without being nationally identified with any
of them.Henry ruled over England, Normandy, and Aquitaine, but he was
neither English, Norman, nor Gascon.(23) That is the greater, the continental, part of the Duchy.The
insular part of Normandy, the Channel Islands, was not lost, and it
still remains attached to the English Crown, not as part of the United
Kingdom, but as a separate dependency.310, 367; and on the appointment of
Bishops and Abbots, i.(25) See the Ordinance in Norman Conquest, iv.Stubbs, Select
Charters, 81.(27) It should be remembered that the clerical immunities which were
claimed in this age were by no means confined to those whom we should
now call clergymen, but that they also took in that large class of
persons who held smaller ecclesiastical offices without being what we
should call in holy orders.The Church also claimed jurisdiction in
the causes of widows and orphans, and in various cases where questions
of perjury, breach of faith, and the like were concerned.Thus John
Bishop of Poitiers writes to Archbishop Thomas (Giles, Sanctus Thomas,
vi.238) complaining that the King’s officers had forbidden him to hear
the causes of widows and orphans, and also to hear causes in matters
of usury: “prohibentes ne ad querelas viduarum vel orphanorum vel
clericorum aliquem parochianorum meorum in causam trahere præsumerem
super quacumque possessione immobili, donec ministeriales regis, vel
dominorum ad quorum feudum res controversiæ pertineret, in facienda
justitia eis defecissent.Deinde ne super accusatione fœnoris
quemquam audirem.” This gives a special force to the acclamations
with which Thomas was greeted on his return as “the father of the
orphans and the judge of the widows:” “Videres mox pauperum turbam
quæ convenerat in occursum, hos succinctos ut prævenirent et patrem
suum applicantem exciperent, et benedictionem præriperent, alios vero
humi se humiliter prosternentes, ejulantes hos, plorantes illos præ
gaudio, et omnes conclamantes, Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini,
pater orphanorum et judex viduarum!et pauperes quidem sic.” Herbert
of Bosham, Giles, Sanctus Thomas, vii.See more in
Historical Essays, 99.(28) On the cruel punishments inflicted in the King’s courts Herbert
of Bosham is very emphatic in more than one passage.101) as a merit of the Bishops’ courts that in them no mutilations
were inflicted.Men were punished there “absque omni mutilatione
vel deformatione membrorum.” But he by no means claims freedom from
mutilation as a mere clerical privilege; he distinctly condemns it in
any case.“Adeo etiam quod ordinis privilegium excludat cauterium: quam
tamen pœnam communiter inter homines etiam jus forense damnat: ne
videlicet in homine Dei imago deformetur.” (vii.A most curious
story illustrative of the barbarous jurisprudence of the time will be
found in Benedict’s Miracula Sancti Thomæ, 184.(29) One of the Constitutions of Clarendon forbade villains to be
ordained without the consent of their lords.“Filii rusticorum non
debent ordinari absque assensu domini de cujus terra nati dignoscuntur”
(Stubbs, Select Charters, 134).On the principles of feudal law nothing
can be said against this, as the lord had a property in his villain
which he would lose by the villain’s ordination.The prohibition
is noticed in some remarkable lines of the earliest biographer of
Thomas, Garnier of Pont-Sainte-Maxence (La Vie de Saint Thomas le
Martyr, Paris, 1859, p.89), where he strongly asserts the equality of
gentleman and villain before God:—

  “Fils à vilains ne fust en nul liu ordenez
   Sanz l’otrei sun seigneur de cui terre il fu nez.Et deus à sun servise nus a tuz apelez!Mielz valt filz à vilain qui est preux e senez,
   Que ne feit gentilz hum failliz et debutez.”

Thomas himself was not the son of a villain, but his birth was such
that the King could sneer at him as “plebeius quidam clericus.”

(30) We are not inclined to find fault with such an appointment as
that of Stephen Langton; still his forced election at the bidding
of Innocent was a distinct breach of the rights of the King, of the
Convent of Christ Church, and of the English nation generally.See the
account of his election in Roger of Wendover, iii.314; Hook’s Archbishops, ii.(31) See the Bulls and Letters by which Innocent professed to annul the
Great Charter in Roger of Wendover, iii.323, 327; the excommunication
of the Barons in iii.336; and the suspension of the Archbishop in iii.(32) There is a separate treatise on the Miracles of Simon of Montfort,
printed along with Rishanger’s Chronicle by the Camden Society, 1840.(33) I think I may safely say that the only royalist chronicler of the
reign of Henry the Third is Thomas Wykes, the Austin Canon of Osney.There is also one poem on the royalist side, to balance many on the
side of the Barons, among the Political Songs published by the Camden
Society, 1839, page 128.Letters to Earl Simon and his Countess Eleanor form a considerable part
of the letters of Robert Grosseteste, published by Mr.Luard for the
Master of the Rolls.Matthew Paris also (879, Wats) speaks of him as
“episcopus Lincolniensis Robertus, cui comes tamquam patri confessori
exstitit familiarissimus.” This however was in the earlier part of
Simon’s career, before the war had broken out.The share of Bishop
Walter of Cantilupe, who was present at Evesham and absolved the Earl
and his followers, will be found in most of the Chronicles of the time.It comes out well in the riming Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester (ii.558):—

  “Þe bissop Water of Wurcetre asoiled hom alle pere
   And prechede hom, þat hii adde of deþ þe lasse fere.”

This writer says of the battle of Evesham:—

  “Suich was þe morþre of Eivesham (vor bataile non it was).”

(34) This letter, addressed in 1247 to Pope Innocent the Fourth, will
be found in Matthew Paris (721, Wats).It is written in the name of
“universitas cleri et populi per provinciam Cantuariensem constituti,”
and it ends, “quia communitas nostra sigillum non habet, præsentes
literas signo communitatis civitatis Londinensis vestræ sanctitati
mittimus consignatas.” Another letter in the same form follows to the
Cardinals.There are two earlier letters in 1245 and 1246 (Matthew
Paris, 666, 700), the former from the “magnates et universitas regni
Angliæ,” the other in the name of Richard Earl of Cornwall (afterwards
King of the Romans), Simon Earl of Leicester, and other Earls, “et alii
totius regni Angliæ Barones, proceres, et magnates, et nobiles portuum
maris habitatores, necnon et clerus et populus universus.” The distinct
mention of the Cinque Ports, whose representatives in Parliament are
still called Barons—the “nobiles” of the letter—should be noticed.(35) The writer of the Gesta Stephani(3) distinctly attributes the
election of Stephen to the citizens of London: “Majores igitur natu,
consultuque quique provectiores, concilium coegere, deque regni
statu, pro arbitrio suo, utilia in commune providentes, ad regem
eligendum unanimiter conspiravere.” He then goes on with the details
of the election.He is borne out by the Chronicle 1135: “Stephne de
Blais com to Lundene and te Lundenisce folc him underfeng;” and by
William of Malmesbury, Historia Novella, i.11: “A Londoniensibus et
Wintoniensibus in Regem exceptus est.” So again when the Legate, Henry
Bishop of Winchester, holds a council for the election of the Empress
Matilda, the citizens of London were summoned, and it is distinctly
said that they held the rank of nobles or barons: “Londonienses
(qui sunt quasi optimates, pro magnitudine civitatis, in Anglia).”
“Londonienses, qui præcipui habebantur in Anglia, sicut proceres”
(Historia Novella, iii.All this is exactly like the earlier
elections of Kings before the Conquest.(36) The words of the Charter 12-14 (Stubbs, 290) are: “Nullum
scutagium vel auxilium ponatur in regno nostro, nisi per commune
consilium regni nostri, nisi ad corpus nostrum redimendum, etc.....
Et ad habendum commune consilium regni, de auxilio assidendo aliter
quam in tribus casibus prædictis, vel de scutagio assidendo, summoneri
faciemus archiepiscopos, episcopos, abbates, comites, et majores
barones, sigillatim per litteras nostras; et præterea faciemus
summoneri in generali, per vicecomites et ballivos nostros, omnes
illos qui de nobis tenent in capite.” This is exactly like the entry
in the Chronicle (1123), describing the summoning of a Witenagemót by
Henry the First: “Da sone Þæræfter sende se kyng hise write ofer eal
Englalande, and bed hise biscopes and hise abbates and hise Þeignes
ealle Þet hi scolden cumen to his gewitenemot on Candelmesse deig to
Gleawceastre him togeanes; and hi swa diden.”

(37) These first glimmerings of parliamentary representation were
carefully traced out by Hallam (Middle Ages, ii.They can
now be more fully studied in the work of Professor Stubbs.On the
summons in 1213 of four men for each shire besides “milites et barones”
(“quatuor discretos homines de comitatu tuo illuc venire facias”),
the Professor remarks (278): “It is the first writ in which the ‘four
discreet men’ of the county appear as representatives; the first
instance of the summoning of the folkmoot to a general assembly by the
machinery already used for judicial purposes.”

(38) On this subject the eighth chapter of Sir Francis Palgrave’s
English Commonwealth should be studied.(39) For the whole career of Simon I must again refer generally to
Pauli and Blaauw.The great writ itself, dated at Worcester, December
14th, 1264, will be found in Rymer’s Fœdera, i.It has often
been noticed how small is the number of Earls and other lay Barons, and
how unusually large the number of churchmen, who are summoned to this
Parliament.The whole list will be found in Rymer.The parts of the
writ which concern us stand thus:

“Item mandatum est singulis vicecomitibus per Angliam; quod venire
faciant duos milites de legalioribus, probioribus et discretioribus
militibus singulorum comitatuum, ad Regem London’ in octab’ prædictis,
in formâ supradictâ.“Item in formâ prædictâ scribitur civibus Ebor’, civibus Lincoln’,
et cæteris burgis Angliæ; quod mittant in formâ prædictâ duos de
discretioribus, legalioribus, et probioribus, tam civibus, quam
burgensibus suis.“Item in formâ prædictâ mandatum est baronibus, et probis hominibus
Quinque Portuum.”

“This is often regarded as the origin of popular representation; but it
is not in any sense entitled to that praise.The novelty was simply the
assembling the representatives of the towns in conjunction with those
of the counties; this was now done for the first time for the purpose
of the national council.” Stubbs, 401.(40) The account of this most remarkable trial, held on June 11th,
1252, is given in a letter from Simon’s intimate friend the famous
Franciscan Adam Marsh (de Marisco) to Bishop Robert Grosseteste.Brewer’s Monumenta Franciscana, p.122,
and there is an English translation in the Appendix to Mrs.Green’s
Life of Countess Eleanor, English Princesses, ii.Simon’s
witnesses, knights and citizens, come “muniti litteris patentibus
communitatis Burdegalensis, in quâ quasi totum robur Vasconiæ ad
distringendum hostiles et fideles protegendum consistere dignoscitur,”
setting forth how good Simon’s government was in every way, and how
those who brought charges against him did it only because his strict
justice had put a check on their misdoings.We may compare the words of
the great poetical manifesto (Political Songs, 76).“Seductorem nominant S. atque fallacem,
   Facta sed examinant probantque veracem.”

(41) For the Londoners at Lewes let us take the account of an enemy.Thomas Wykes (148) tells us how the Earl set out, “glorians in virtute
sua congregata baronum multitudine copiosa, Londoniensium innumerabili
agmine circumcinctus, quia legitur stultorum infinitus est numerus.”
Presently we read how the “Londoniensium innumera multitudo, bellorum
ignara,” were put to flight by the Lord Edward very much after the
manner of Prince Rupert.(42) On the religious reverence paid to Earl Waltheof, see Norman
Conquest, ii.I have there referred to the office of Thomas of
Lancaster, which will be found in Political Songs, 268.Some of the
pieces are what we should think most daring parodies of parts of the
Church Service, but we may be sure that what was intended was reverence
and not irreverence.There is another parody of the same kind in honour
of Earl Thomas, a little earlier back in the volume, p.It was a
matter of course that Thomas of Lancaster should be likened to Thomas
of Canterbury.“Gaude, Thoma, ducum decus, lucerna Lancastriæ,
   Qui per necem imitaris Thomam Cantuariæ;
   Cujus caput conculcatur pacem ob ecclesiæ,
   Atque tuum detruncatur causa pacis Angliæ.(43) Let us take a Latin, a French, and an English specimen of the
poems in which Simon’s death was lamented and his intercession implored.“Salve, Symon Montis Fortis,
     Totius flos militiæ,
   Durus pœnas passus mortis,
     Protector gentis Angliæ.Sunt de sanctis inaudita
   Cunctis passis in hac vita,
     Quemquam passum talia;
   Manus, pedes, amputari,
   Caput, corpus, vulnerari,
     Abscidi virilia.Sis pro nobis intercessor
   Apud Deum, qui defensor
     In terris exstiteras.”—(Political Songs, 124.)The French poem which follows directly in the collection is too long to
copy in full.This is perhaps the most remarkable stanza, in which we
again find the comparison with Thomas of Canterbury:—

  “Mès par sa mort, le cuens Mountfort conquist la victorie,
   Come ly martyr de Caunterbyr, finist sa vie;
   Ne voleit pas li bon Thomas qe perist seinte Eglise,
   Le cuens auxi se combati, e morust sauntz feyntise.Ore est ocys la flur de pris, qe taunt savoit de guerre,
   Ly quens Montfort, sa dure mort molt emplorra la terre.”

In this poem there is not, as in the Latin one, any direct prayer to
the martyred Earl, but in the last stanza we read:—

  “Sire Simoun ly prodhom, e sa compagnie,
   En joie vont en ciel amount, en pardurable vie.”

The only English piece on these wars belongs to an earlier date,
namely, the satirical poem against King Richard, how the one English
Augustus

  “Makede him a castel of a mulne post;”

but we get verses on Simon’s death in the Chronicle of Robert of
Gloucester (ii.559):—

  “& sir Simond was aslawe, & is folk al to grounde,
   More murÞre are nas in so lute stounde.Vor Þere was werst Simond de Mountfort aslawe, alas!& sir Henri is sone, Þat so gentil knizt was.*       *       *       *       *

   & among alle oÞere mest reuÞe it was ido,
   Þat sir Simon Þe olde man demembred was so.”

He then goes on with the details of the dismemberment, of which a
picture may be seen opposite p.Blaauw’s book, and then goes
on with the lines which I have before quoted:—

  “Suich was Þe morÞre of Eivesham (vor bataile non it was),
   And Þer wiÞ Jesu Crist wel vuele ipaied was,
   As he ssewede bitokninge grisliche and gode,
   As it vel of him sulue, Þo he deide on Þe rode,
   Þat Þoru al Þe middelerd derk hede Þer was inou.”

(44) On the occasional and irregular summoning of the borough members
between 1265 and 1295 see Hallam, Middle Ages, ii.160, 165, and
more fully in Stubbs, Select Charters, 420, 427, where the gradual
developement of parliamentary representation is treated as it has
never been treated before, with a full citation of the authorities.The language in which the chroniclers speak of the constitution of the
early Parliaments of Edward is as vague as that in which our ancient
Gemóts are described.Sometimes they speak only of “proceres” and the
like; sometimes they distinctly mention the popular element.Curiously
enough, the official language is sometimes more popular than that of
the annalists.Thus the Winchester Annals, recording the Statute of
Westminster in 1273, call the Assembly which passed it a “communis
convocatio omnium magnatum regni,” though it incidentally implies the
presence of other persons, “quamplures de regno qui aliqua feoda de
corona regia tenuerunt.” But the preamble of the Statute itself records
the “assentement des erceveskes, eveskes, abbes, priurs, contes,
barons, et _la communaute de la tere_ ileokes somons.” So in the later
Parliament of the same year the Annals speak only of the “communis
consensus archiepiscoporum, comitum, et baronum,” while the official
description is “prælati, comites, barones, et alii de regno nostro.”
But in an earlier Assembly, that held in 1273, before Edward had come
back to England, the same Winchester Annals tell us how “convenerunt
archiepiscopi et episcopi, comites et barones, et _de quolibet comitatu
quatuor milites et de qualibet civitate quatuor_.” This and the
summons to the Parliament of 1285, which sat in judgement on David
of Wales (Stubbs, 453, 457), seem the most distinct cases of borough
representation earlier than 1295, since which time the summoning of the
borough members has gone on regularly.Stubbs’
remarks on the Assemblies of “the transitionary period” in pp.465, 469
should be specially studied.(45) The history of the resistance of these two Earls to King Edward,
which led to the great Confirmation of the Charters in 1297, will be
found in all the histories of the time, old and new.See also Stubbs,
431, 479.I feel no difficulty in reconciling respect for Edward with
respect for the men who withstood him.The case is well put by Stubbs,
34, 35.(46) The exact value of the document commonly known as the statute “De
Tallagio non concedendo” is discussed by Professor Stubbs, p.It
is perhaps safest to look on it, like many of the earlier collections
of laws, not indeed as an actual statute, but as good evidence of a
principle which, from the time of the Confirmation of the Charters, has
been universally received.The words are—

“Nullum tallagium vel auxilium per nos vel hæredes nostros de cetero in
regno nostro imponatur seu levetur, sine voluntate et assensu communi
archiepiscoporum, episcoporum et aliorum prælatorum, comitum, baronum,
militum, burgensium, et aliorum liberorum hominum in regno nostro.”
This, it will be seen, is the same provision which I have already
quoted (see above, Note 36) from the Great Charter of John, but which
was left out in the Charter in the form in which it was confirmed by
Henry the Third.See Stubbs, 330, 332, 336.(47) I have said this before in Historical Essays, p.On the
strongly marked legal character of Edward’s age, and especially of
Edward’s own mind, see Stubbs, 417.(48) The great statute of treason of 25 Edward the Third (see the
Revised Edition of the Statutes, i.185) secures the life of the King,
his wife, and his eldest son, and the chastity of his wife, his eldest
daughter, and his eldest son’s wife.But the personal privilege goes no
further.As the Law of England knows no classes of men except peers and
commoners, it follows that the younger children of the King—the eldest
is born Duke of Cornwall—are, in strictness of speech, commoners,
unless they are personally raised to the peerage.I am not aware that
either case has ever arisen, but I conceive that there is nothing to
hinder a King’s son, not being a peer, from voting at an election, or
from being chosen to the House of Commons, and I conceive that, if
he committed a crime, he would be tried by a jury.Mere precedence
and titles have nothing to do with the matter, though probably a good
deal of confusion arises from the very modern fashion—one might almost
say the modern vulgarism—of calling all the children of the King or
Queen “Princes” and “Princesses.” As late as the time of George the
Second uncourtly Englishmen were still found who eschewed the foreign
innovation, and who spoke of the Lady Caroline and the Lady Emily, as
their fathers had done before them.Another modern vulgarism is that of using the word “royal”—“royal
visit,” “royal marriage,” and so forth—when there is no royalty in the
case, the person spoken of being a subject, perhaps a commoner.(49) On the parliamentary position of the clergy see Hallam, Middle
Ages, ii.And as far as the reign of Edward the First is
concerned, see the series of summonses in Stubbs, 442.(50) On this important constitutional change, which was made in
1664, without any Act of Parliament, but by a mere verbal agreement
between Archbishop Sheldon and Lord Chancellor Clarendon, see Hallam,
Constitutional History, ii.(51) This is true on the whole, especially at the beginning of the
institution of the States General, though there were also _roturiers_
who were the immediate burgesses of the King.See Thierry, History
of the Tiers Etat, i.It is in that work that the
history of that branch of the States General should be studied.(52) The question of one or two Chambers in an ordinary monarchy or
commonwealth is altogether different from the same question under a
Federal system.In England or France the question between one or two
Chambers in the Legislature is simply a question in which of the two
ways the Legislature is likely to do its work best.But in a Federal
constitution, like that of Switzerland or the United States, the two
Chambers are absolutely necessary.The double sovereignty, that of
the whole nation and that of the independent and equal States which
have joined together to form it, can be rightly represented only
by having two Chambers, one of them, the _Nationalrath_ or House
of Representatives, directly representing the nation as such, and
the other, the _Ständerath_ or Senate, representing the separate
sovereignty of the Cantons.In the debates early in 1872 as to the
revision of the Swiss Federal Constitution, a proposal made in the
_Nationalrath_ for the abolition of the _Ständerath_ was thrown out by
a large majority.(53) On the old Constitution of Sweden, see Laing’s Tour in Sweden.(54) This common mistake and its cause are fully explained by Hallam,
Middle Ages, ii.(55) “The two Houses had contended violently in 1675, concerning the
appellate jurisdiction of the Lords; they had contended, with not less
violence, in 1704, upon the jurisdiction of the Commons in matters of
election; they had quarrelled rudely, in 1770, while insisting upon
the exclusion of strangers.But upon general measures of public policy
their differences had been rare and unimportant.” May’s Constitutional
History, i.The writer goes on to show why differences between the
two Houses on important points have become more common in very recent
times.(56) The share of the Witan in early times in the appointment of
Bishops, Ealdormen, and other great officers, need hardly be dwelled
upon.For a debate in a Witenagemót of Eadward the Confessor on a
question of peace or war, see Norman Conquest, ii.For the like
under Henry the Third, see the account in Matthew Paris, in the year
1242 which will be found in Stubbs, 359.The state of the case under
Edward the Third is discussed by Hallam, Middle Ages, ii.But the most remarkable passage of all is one in the
great poetical manifesto which I have several times quoted: it is there
(Political Songs, 96) made one of the charges against Henry the Third
that he wished to keep the appointment of the great officers of state
in his own hands.The passage is long, but it is well worth quoting at
length.“Rex cum suis voluit ita liber esse;
   Et sic esse debuit, fuitque necesse
   Aut esse desineret rex, privatus jure
   Regis, nisi faceret quidquid vellet; curæ
   Non esse magnatibus regni quos præferret
   Suis comitatibus, vel quibus conferret
   Castrorum custodiam, vel quem exhibere
   Populo justitiam vellet, et habere
   Regni cancellarium thesaurariumque.Suum ad arbitrium voluit quemcumque,
   Et consiliarios de quacumque gente,
   Et ministros varios se præcipiente,
   Non intromittentibus se de factis regis
   Angliæ baronibus, vim habente legis
   Principis imperio, et quod imperaret
   Suomet arbitrio singulos ligaret.”

(57) Take for example the Act passed after Edward the Fourth’s success
at Towton.Among other things, poor Henry the Sixth
is not only branded as an usurper, but is charged with personally
stirring up the movement in the North, which led to the battle of
Wakefield and the death of Richard Duke of York.“The seid Henry
Usurpour, late called Kyng Henry the Sixt, contynuyng in his olde
rancour & malice, usyng the fraude & malicious disceit & dissimulacion
ayenst trouth & conscience, that accorde not with the honoure of eny
Cristen Prynce,... with all subtill ymaginacions & disceitfull weyes
& meanes to hym possible, intended & covertely laboured, excited &
procured the fynal destruction, murdre & deth of the seid Richard Duc,
and of his Sonnes, that is to sey, of oure seid nowe Soverayne Lord
Kyng Edward the fourth, then Erle of Marche, & of the noble Lord Edmund
Erle of Ruthlande; & for th’ execution of his dampnable & malicious
purpose, by writing & other messages, mowed, excited, & stured therunto
the Duks of Excestr’ & Somerset, & other lordes beyng then in the North
parties of this Reame.”

(58) This statute was passed in 8 Henry VI.The complaint
which it makes is well worth notice, and shows the reactionary
tendencies of the time.The county elections had been made by “very
great, outrageous, and excessive number of people dwelling within the
same counties, of which most part was people of small substance, and
of no value, whereof every of them pretended a voice equivalent, as to
such elections to be made, with the most worthy knights and esquires
dwelling within the same counties.” To hinder “the manslaughters,
riots, batteries, and divisions,” which were likely to take place—it is
not said that they had taken place—no one is to be allowed to vote who
has not “free land or tenement to the value of forty shillings by the
year at the least above all charges.” It is also provided that both the
electors and the elected are to be actually resident in the county.“Item come lez eleccions dez Chivalers des Countees esluz a venir as
parlements du Roi en plusours Countees Dengleterre, ore tarde ount
este faitz par trop graunde & excessive nombre dez gents demurrantz

chescun ait frank tenement a le valu de xl s. par an al meins outre les
reprises; & que ceux qui seront ensy esluz soient demurrantz & receantz
deins mesmes les Countes.” Revised Statutes, i.The necessity of residence in the case of either electors or
representatives was repealed by 14 Geo.The statute goes on to give the Sheriff power to examine the electors
on oath as to the amount of their property.It also gives the Judges of
Assize a power foreshadowing that of our present Election Judges, that
of inquiring into false returns made by the Sheriff.Another statute of the same kind was passed later in the same reign,
23 Henry VI.1444-5, from which it appears that the knights of
the shire were ceasing to be in all cases knights in the strict sense,
and that it was beginning to be found needful to fence them about with
oligarchic restrictions.“Issint que lez Chivalers dez Counteez pour le parlement en après a
esliers so ent notablez Chivalers dez mesmez lez Counteez pour lez
queux ils serront issint esluz, ou autrement tielx notablez Esquiers
gentils homez del Nativite dez mesmez lez Counteez comme soient ablez
destre Chivalers; et null home destre tiel Chivaler que estoise en la
degree de vadlet et desouth.” Revised Statutes, i.Every enactment of this kind bears witness to the growth of the power
of the Commons, and to the endeavours of the people to make their
representation really popular.(59) Take for instance the account given by the chronicler Hall (p.253) of the election of Edward the Fourth.“After the lordes had considered and weyghed his title and declaracion,
they determined by authoritie of the sayd counsaill, for as much as
kyng Henry, contrary to his othe, honor and agreement, had violated
and infringed, the order taken and enacted in the last Parliament,
and also, because he was insufficient to rule the Realme, & inutile
to the common wealth, & publique profite of the pore people, he was
therefore by the aforesayed authoritie, depriued & deiected of all
kyngly honor, & regall souereigntie.And incontinent, Edward erle of
Marche, sonne and heyre to Richard duke of Yorke, was by the lordes in
the sayd counsaill assembled, named, elected, & admitted, for kyng &
gouernour of the realme; on which day, the people of the erles parte,
beyng in their muster in sainct Ihons felde, & a great number of the
substanciall citezens there assembled, to behold their order: sodaynly
the lord Fawconbridge, which toke the musters, wisely declared to
the multitude, the offences & breaches of the late agremente done &
perpetrated by kyng Henry the vi.& demaunded of the people, whether
they woulde haue the sayd kyng Henry to rule & reigne any lenger ouer
them: To whome they with a whole voyce, aunswered, nay, nay.Then
he asked them, if they would serue, loue, & obey the erle of March
as their earthly prince & souereign lord.To which question they
aunswered, yea, yea, crieng, king Edward, with many great showtes and
clappyng of handes.... The erle,... as kyng, rode to the church of
sainct Paule, and there offered.And after _Te deum_ song, with great
solempnitie, he was conueyed to Westmynster, and there set in the
hawle, with the scepter royall in his hand, where to all the people
which there in a great number were assembled, his title and clayme
to the croune of England, was declared by, ii.maner of ways: the
firste, as sonne and heyre to duke Richard his father, right enheritor
to the same; the second, by aucthoritie of Parliament and forfeiture
committed by, kyng Henry.Wherupon it was agayne demaunded of the
commons, if they would admitte, and take the sayd erle as their prince
and souereigne lord, which al with one voice cried, yea, yea.... On
the morow he was proclaymed kyng by the name of kyng Edward the iiij.throughout the citie.”

This was in Lent 1461, before the battle of Towton.Edward was crowned
June 29th in the same year.The same chronicler describes the election
or acknowledgement of Richard the Third, p.(60) One special sign of the advance of the power of Parliament in the
fifteenth century was the practice of bringing in bills in the form
of Statutes ready made.Hitherto the Acts of the Commons had taken
the form of petitions, and it was sometimes found that, after the
Parliament had broken up, the petitions had been fraudulently modified.They now brought in bills, which the King accepted or rejected as they
stood.“The knight of the shire was the connecting link
between the baron and the shopkeeper.On the same benches on which
sate the goldsmiths, drapers, and grocers who had been returned to
Parliament by the commercial towns, sate also members who, in any other
country, would have been called noblemen, hereditary lords of manors,
entitled to hold courts and to bear coat armour, and able to trace
back an honourable descent through many generations.Some of them were
younger sons and brothers of great lords.Others could boast even of
royal blood.At length the eldest son of an Earl of Bedford, called
in courtesy by the second title of his father, offered himself as a
candidate for a seat in the House of Commons, and his example was
followed by others.Seated in that house, the heirs of the grandees of
the realm naturally became as zealous for its privileges as any of the
humble burgesses with whom they were mingled.”

Hallam remarks (ii.250) that it is in the reign of Edward the Fourth
that we first find borough members bearing the title of Esquire, and
he goes on to refer to the Paston Letters as showing how important
a seat in Parliament was then held, and as showing also the undue
influences which were already brought to bear upon the electors.Since
Hallam’s time, the authenticity of the Paston Letters has been called
in question, but it has, I think, been fully established.Some of the
entries are very curious indeed.96), without any date of
the year, the Duchess of Norfolk writes to John Paston, Esquire, to
use his influence at a county election on behalf of some creatures of
the Duke’s: “It is thought right necessarie for divers causes þͭ my
Lord have at this tyme in the p’lement suche p’sones as longe unto him
and be of his menyall S’vaunts wherin we conceyve yoͬ good will and
diligence shal be right expedient.” The persons to be thus chosen for
the convenience of the Duke are described as “our right wel-belovid
Cossin and S’vaunts John Howard and Syr Roger Chambirlayn.” This is
followed by a letter from the Earl of Oxford in 1455, much to the same
effect.98, we have a letter addressed to the Bailiff of Maldon,
recommending the election of Sir John Paston on behalf of a certain
great lady not named.“Ryght trusty frend I comand me to yow preyĩg yow to call to yoʳ

(62) On the effects of the reign of Charles the Fifth in Spain and
his overthrow of the liberties of Castile, see the general view in
Robertson, iii.186) he glorifies
the King’s clemency.See also the first chapter of the sixth book
of Prescott’s Philip the Second, and on the suppression of the
constitution of Aragon by Philip, Watson, Philip the Second, iii.The last meeting of the French States-General before the final meeting
in 1789 was that in 1614, during the minority of Lewis the Thirteenth.(63) The legal character of William’s despotism I have tried to set
forth almost throughout the whole of my fourth volume.8, 617; but it is plain to everyone who has the slightest knowledge
of Domesday.Nothing can show more utter ignorance of the real
character of the man and his times than the idea of William being a
mere “rude man of war,” as I have seen him called.(64) On the true aspect of the reign of Henry the Eighth I have said
something in the Fortnightly Review, September 1871.(65) Both these forms of undue influence on the part of the Crown
are set forth by Hallam, Constitutional History, i.“It will not be pretended,” he says, “that the wretched villages,
which corruption and perjury still hardly keep from famine [this was
written before the Reform Bill, in 1827], were seats of commerce and
industry in the sixteenth century.But the county of Cornwall was more
immediately subject to a coercive influence, through the indefinite and
oppressive jurisdiction of the stannary court.Similar motives, if we
could discover the secrets of those governments, doubtless operated in
most other cases.”

In the same page the historian, speaking of the different boroughs and
counties which received the franchise in the sixteenth century, says,
“It might be possible to trace the reason, why the county of Durham was
passed over.” And he suggests, “The attachment of those northern parts
to popery seems as likely as any other.” The reason for the omission
of Durham was doubtless that the Bishoprick had not wholly lost the
character of a separate principality.It was under Charles the Second
that Durham city and county, as well as Newark, first sent members to
Parliament.Durham was enfranchised by Act of Parliament, as Chester
city and county—hitherto kept distinct as being a Palatinate—were by
34 & 35 Hen.Newark was
enfranchised by a Royal Charter, the last case of that kind of exercise
of the prerogative.(66) I do not know what was the exact state of Old Sarum in 1265 or
in 1295, but earlier in the thirteenth century it was still the chief
dwelling-place both of the Earl and of the Bishop.But in the reign
of Edward the Third it had so greatly decayed that the stones of the
Cathedral were used for the completion of the new one which had arisen
in the plain.(67) On the relations between Queen Elizabeth and her Parliaments,
and especially for the bold bearing of the two Wentworths, Peter and
Paul, see the fifth chapter of Hallam’s Constitutional History, largely
grounded on the Journals of Sir Simonds D’Ewes.The frontispiece to
D’Ewes’ book (London, 1682) gives a lively picture of a Parliament of
those days.(68) On the relations between the Crown and the House of Commons under
James the First, see the sixth chapter of Hallam’s Constitutional
History, and the fifth chapter of Gardner’s History of England from
1603 to 1616.(1) This was the famous motion made by Sir Robert Peel against the
Ministry of Lord Melbourne, and carried by a majority of one, June 4,
1841.See May’s Constitutional History, i.Irving’s Annals of our
Times, 86.(2) This of course leaves to the Ministry the power of appealing to the
country by a dissolution of Parliament; but, if the new Parliament also
declares against them, it is plain that they have nothing to do but to
resign office.In the case of 1841 Lord Melbourne dissolved Parliament,
and, on the meeting of the new Parliament, an amendment to the address
was carried by a majority of ninety-one, August 28, 1841.(3) This is well set forth by Sir John Fortescue, De Laudibus Legum
Angliæ, cap.36: “Neque Rex ibidem, per se aut ministros suos,
tallegia, subsidia, aut quævis onera alia, imponit legiis suis, aut
leges eorum mutat, vel novas condit, sine concessione vel assensu
totius regni sui in parliamento suo expresso.”

(4) How very recent the establishment of these principles is will be
seen by anyone who studies the history of the reign of George the Third
in the work of Sir T. E. May.Pitt, as is well known, kept office
in defiance of repeated votes of the House of Commons, and at last, by
a dissolution at a well-chosen moment, showed that the country was on
his side.Such conduct would not be deemed constitutional now, but the
wide difference between the constitution of the House of Commons then
and now should be borne in mind.(5) Though the command of the Sovereign would be no excuse for any
illegal act, and though the advisers of any illegal act are themselves
responsible for it, yet there would seem to be no way provided for
punishing an illegal act done by the Sovereign in his own person.The
Sovereign may therefore be said to be personally irresponsible.(6) See Macaulay, iv.It should not be forgotten that writers like
Blackstone and De Lolme say nothing about the Cabinet.Serjeant Stephen
supplies the omission, ii.(7) The lowly outward position of the really ruling assembly comes out
in some degree at the opening of every session of Parliament.But it is
far more marked in the grotesque, and probably antiquated, ceremonies
of a Conference of the two Houses.This comes out most curiously of all
in the Conference between the two Houses of the Convention in 1688.(8) See Note 56, Chapter ii.(9) See Macaulay, iv.(10) “Ministers” or “Ministry” were the words always used at the
time of the Reform Bill in 1831-1832.It would be curious to trace
at what time the present mode of speech came into vogue, either in
parliamentary debates or in common speech.Another still later change marks a step toward the recognition of the
Cabinet.It has long been held that a Secretary of State must always
accompany the Sovereign everywhere.It is now beginning to be held that
any member of the Cabinet will do as well as a Secretary of State.But
if any member of the Cabinet, why not any Privy Councillor?Cayley moved for a “Select Committee to
consider the duties of the Member leading the Government business in
this House, and the expediency of attaching office and salary thereto.”
The motion was withdrawn, after being opposed by Sir Charles Wood
(now Viscount Halifax), Mr.Walpole, and Lord John Russell (now Earl
Russell).Sir Charles Wood described the post of Leader of the House
as “an office that does not exist, and the duties of which cannot be
defined.” Mr.Walpole spoke of it as a “position totally unknown to the
constitution of the country.” Yet I presume that everybody practically
knew that Lord John Russell was Leader of the House, though nobody
could give a legal definition of his position.Walpole and Lord John Russell on the nature of
ministerial responsibility.Walpole said that “members were apt to
talk gravely of ministerial responsibility; but responsibility there is
none, except by virtue of the office that a Minister holds, or possibly
by the fact of his being a Privy Councillor.A Minister is responsible
for the acts done by him; a Privy Councillor for advice given by him in
that capacity.Daniel journeyed to the garden.Until the reign of Charles the Second, Privy Councillors
always signed the advice they gave; and to this day the Cabinet is not
a body recognised by law.As a Privy Councillor, a person is under
little or no responsibility for the acts advised by him, on account of
the difficulty of proof.” Lord John Russell “asked the House to pause
before it gave assent to the constitutional doctrines laid down by Mr.He unduly restricted the responsibility of Ministers.”... “I
hold,” continued Lord John, “that it is not really for the business the
Minister transacts in performing the particular duties of his office,
but it is for any advice which he has given, and which he may be
proved, before a Committee of this House, or at the bar of the House of
Lords, to have given, that he is responsible, and for which he suffers
the penalties that may ensue from impeachment.”

It is plain that both Mr.Walpole and Lord Russell were here speaking
of real legal responsibility, such responsibility as might be enforced
by impeachment or other legal process, not of the vaguer kind of
responsibility which is commonly meant when we speak of Ministers being
“responsible to the House of Commons.” This last is enforced, not by
legal process, but by such motions as that of Sir Robert Peel in 1841,
or that of the Marquess of Hartington in June 1859.I have made my extracts from the Spectator newspaper of February 11,
1854.(12) We read (Anglia Sacra, i.335) of Æthelric, Bishop of the
South-Saxons at the time of the Conquest, as “vir antiquissimus et
legum terræ sapientissimus.” So Adelelm, the first Norman Abbot of
Abingdon, found much benefit from the legal knowledge of certain of his
English monks (Chronicon Monasterii de Abingdon, ii.2), “quibus tanta
secularium facundia et præteritorum memoria eventorum inerat, ut cæteri
circumquaque facile eorum sententiam ratam fuisse, quam edicerent,
approbarent.” The writer adds, “Sed et alii plures de Anglis causidici
per id tempus in abbatia ista habebantur quorum collationi nemo sapiens
refragabatur.” But knowledge of the law was not an exclusively clerical
accomplishment; for among the grounds for the election of King Harold
himself, we find (de Inventione Sanctæ Crucis Walthamensis, p.25,
Stubbs) that one was “quia non erat eo prudentior in terra, armis
strenuus magis, legum terræ sagacior.” See Norman Conquest, ii.(13) On the growth of the lawyers’ theory of the royal prerogative, and
its utter lack of historical standing-ground, I must refer once for all
to Allen’s Inquiry into the Rise and Growth of the Royal Prerogative in
England.(15) The history of this memorable revolution will be found in
Lingard, iii.392-405, and the legal points are brought out by Hallam,
Middle Ages, ii.He remarks that “In this revolution of 1399
there was as remarkable an attention shown to the formalities of the
constitution, allowance made for the men and the times, as in that
of 1688;” and, speaking of the device by which the same Parliament
was brought together again, he adds, “In this contrivance, more than
in all the rest, we may trace the hand of lawyers.” The official
version entered on the rolls of Parliament by command of Henry will
be found in Walsingham, ii.Some care seems to be used to
avoid using the name of Parliament in the account of the actual
proceedings.It is said just before, “Rex perductus est Londonias,
conservandus in Turri usque ad Parliamentum proximo celebrandum.”
And the writs are said to have been sent “ad personas regni qui de
jure debeant interesse Parliamento.” But when they have come together
(“quibus convenientibus”) care seems to be taken to give the Assembly
no particular name, till, in the Act of Richard’s deposition, the
actors are described as “pares et proceres regni Angliæ spirituales
et temporales, et ejus regni communitates, omnes status ejusdem regni
repræsentantes;” and in the Act of Henry’s election they are described
as “domini tam spirituales quam temporales, et omnes regni status.” In
the Act of deposition Richard’s resignation of the Crown is recorded,
as well as his particular crimes and his general unfitness to wear it,
all which are classed together as reasons for his deposition.The
actual formula of deposition runs thus:—“propter præmissa, et eorum
prætextu, ab omni dignitate et honore regiis, _si quid dignitatis et
honoris hujusmodi in eo remanserit_, merito deponendum pronunciamus,
decernimus, et declaramus; et etiam simili cautela deponimus.” They
then declare the throne to be vacant (“ut constabat de præmissis,
et eorum occasione, regnum Angliæ, cum pertinentiis suis, vacare”).Henry then makes his challenge, setting forth that strange mixture of
titles which is commented on in most narratives of the event, and the
Estates, without saying which of Henry’s arguments they accept, grant
the kingdom to him (“concesserunt unanimiter ut Dux præfatus super eos
regnaret”).A more distinct case of deposition and election can hardly
be found; only in the words which I have put in italics there seems a
sort of anxiety to complete, by the act of deposition, any possible
defect in Richard’s doubtless unwilling abdication.The French narrative by a partisan of Richard (Lystoire de la Traison
et Mort du Roy Richart Dengleterre, p.68) gives, in some respects, a
different account.The Assembly is called a Parliament, and the Duke
of Lancaster is made to seat himself on the throne at once.Then Sir
Thomas Percy “cria ‘Veez Henry de Lencastre Roy Dengleterre.’ Adonc
crierent tous les seigneurs prelaz et _le commun de Londres_, Ouy Ouy
nous voulons que Henry duc de Lencastre soit nostre Roy et nul autre.”
For “le commun de Londres” there are other readings, “le commun,” “le
commun Dangleterre et de Londres,” and “tout le commun et conseil de
Londres.”

(16) It should be remembered that Charles the First was not deposed,
but was executed being King.He was called King both in the indictment
at his trial and in the warrant of his beheading.(17) Monk raised this point in 1660.612) remarks that at this particular moment “there
was no court to influence, no interference of the military to control
the elections.” The Convention may therefore be supposed to have been
more freely elected than most Parliaments.(19) The Long Parliament had dissolved itself, and had decreed the
election of its successor.733) the Long Parliament is “declared and adjudged to be fully
dissolved and determined;” but it is not said when it was dissolved and
determined.5; Hallam’s Constitutional History,
ii.21, where the whole matter is discussed, and it is remarked that
“the next Parliament never gave their predecessors any other name in
the Journals than ‘the late assembly.’”

(20) See Norman Conquest, i.(21) See the discussion on the famous vote of the Convention Parliament
in Hallam, Constitutional History, ii.Hallam remarks that “the word ‘forfeiture’ might better have answered
this purpose than ‘abdication’ or ‘desertion,’” and he adds, “they
proceeded not by the stated rules of the English government, but by
the general rights of mankind.They looked not so much to Magna Charta
as the original compact of society, and rejected Coke and Hale for
Hooker and Harrington.” My position is that there is no need to go to
what Hallam calls “higher constitutional laws” for the justification
of the doings of the Convention, but that they were fully justified
by the precedents of English History from the eighth century to the
fourteenth.The Scottish Estates, it should be remembered, did not shrink from
using the word “forfeited.” Macaulay, iii.(22) See the Act 1 William and Mary “for removing and preventing all
Questions and Disputes concerning the Assembling and Sitting of this
Present Parliament” (Revised Statutes, ii.It decrees “That the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons convened at Westminster the
two and twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand
six hundred eighty-eight, and there sitting on the thirteenth day of
February following, are the two Houses of Parliament, and so shall be
and are hereby declared enacted and adjudged to be to all intents,
constructions, and purposes whatsoever, notwithstanding any fault of
writ or writs of summons, or any defect of form or default whatsoever,
as if they had been summoned according to the usual form.” The whole
history of the question is given in Macaulay, iii.The whole
matter is summed up in the words (iii.27), “It was answered that the
royal writ was mere matter of form, and that to expose the substance
of our laws and liberties to serious hazard for the sake of a form
would be the most senseless superstition.Wherever the Sovereign, the
Peers spiritual and temporal, and the Representatives freely chosen by
the constituent bodies of the realm were met together, there was the
essence of a Parliament.” In earlier times it might perhaps have been
held that there might be the essence of a Parliament even without the
Sovereign.“A paper had been circulated, in which the
logic of a small sharp pettifogger was employed to prove that writs,
issued in the joint names of William and Mary, ceased to be of force
as soon as William reigned alone.But this paltry cavil had completely
failed.It had not even been mentioned in the Lower House, and had been
mentioned in the Upper only to be contemptuously overruled.” From my
point of view the cavil is certainly paltry, but it is hard to see that
it is more paltry than the others.(24) This is by the Acts 7 and 8 Will.See Stephen’s Commentaries, ii.Blackstone’s
reasoning runs thus: “This dissolution formerly happened immediately
upon the death of the reigning sovereign; for he being considered in
law as the head of the parliament (caput principium, et finis), that
failing, the whole body was held to be extinct.But the calling a new
parliament immediately on the inauguration of the successor being found
inconvenient, and dangers being apprehended from having no parliament
in being, in case of a disputed succession, it was enacted,” etc.By
the Reform Act of 1867 the whole tradition of the lawyers was swept
away.(25) I have said something on this head in Norman Conquest, i.94,
but the whole thing should be studied in Allen’s great section on the
Tenure of Landed Property; Royal Prerogative, 125-155.It is to Allen
that the honour belongs of showing what _bookland_ and _folkland_
really were.(26) I have given a few examples in Norman Conquest, i.Endless
examples will be found in Kemble’s Codex Diplomaticus.(27) See the complaints on this head as late as the time of William
the Third, in Macaulay, iv.On the Acts by which the power of the
Crown in this matter is restrained, see Stephen’s Commentaries, ii.See also May’s Constitutional History, i.(29) This is discussed in full by Allen, Royal Prerogative, 143-145.The great example is the will of King Ælfred.249; Allen, 154-155, who remarks: “By a singular
revolution of policy there was a recurrence in the late reign to the
ancient policy of the Anglo-Saxons.The crown lands were virtually
restored to the public, while the King obtained the right of acquiring
landed property by purchase, and of bequeathing it by will like a
private person.”

(31) Edward the First was the earliest King whose reign is dated from
a time earlier than his coronation.He was out of the kingdom at his
father’s death, and his right was acknowledged without opposition.But
even in this case there was an interregnum.The regnal years of Edward
the First are not reckoned from the day of his father’s death, but
from the day of his funeral, when Edward was acknowledged King, and
when the prelates and nobles swore allegiance to him.See the account
in the Worcester Annals, Annales Monastici, iv.462, and the documents
in Rymer, i. part ii.See also the remarks of Allen, 46, 47.The
doctrine that there can be no interregnum seems to have been put into
shape to please James the First, and it was of course altogether upset
by the great vote of 1688.Now of course there is no interregnum; not
indeed from any mysterious prerogative of the Crown, but simply because
the Act of Settlement has entailed the Crown in a particular way.(32) On this see Norman Conquest, i.See the same
question discussed in quite another part of the world in Herodotus,
vii.(33) The helpless way in which Blackstone himself wrote was perhaps
pardonable in the dark times in which he lived.But it is really too
bad when lawyer after lawyer, in successive editions, gives again to
the world the astounding rubbish which in Blackstone’s day passed
for early constitutional history.In Kerr’s edition of Blackstone,
published in 1857, vol.180, I find repeated, without alteration
or comment, the monstrous assertion of Blackstone: “I believe there
is no instance wherein the Crown of England has ever been asserted to
be elective, except by the regicides at the infamous and unparalleled
trial of King Charles I.” And in Serjeant Stephen’s Commentaries
(1853), which are not a mere edition of Blackstone, but “New
Commentaries partly founded on Blackstone,” the same words are found
in vol.403, only leaving out the epithet “unparalleled,” which
might with truth have been allowed to stay.481-2) we read how “after the Saxon government was firmly established
in this island” came “the subdivision of the kingdom into a heptarchy,
consisting of seven independent kingdoms, peopled and governed by
different clans and colonies.” It seems then that in 1857 there
were learned gentlemen who believed in a kingdom subdivided into a
heptarchy.But when, in the next page, Blackstone tells us how Ælfred
set about “to new-model the constitution, to rebuild it on a plan that
should endure for ages,” and goes on in the usual style to attribute
everything whatever to Ælfred personally, this seems to have been too
much, and the editor gives an extract from Kemble by way of correction.One wonders that, if he had read Kemble at all, he had not learned a
little more from him.It is amusing again when Blackstone tells us (i.186, Kerr), “From Egbert to the death of Edmund Ironside, a period
of above two hundred years, the Crown descended regularly through a
succession of fifteen princes, without any deviation or interruption:
save only”—all the cases where it did not descend regularly, according
to Blackstone’s notions of regularity: But it is almost more amusing
when Serjeant Stephen (ii.410) throws Blackstone’s exceptions, which
are at least historical facts, into a note, and gives us instead as
his own exceptions, the statement, very doubtful and, if true, utterly
irrelevant, that Æthelstan and Eadmund Ironside were illegitimate (see
Norman Conquest, i.We of course get the usual talk about the
usurpations of Harold, Stephen, John, and Henry the Fourth, and about
the rights of Eadgar and Arthur of Britanny.For the former we get a
quotation from Matthew Paris, to whom it would have been more to the
purpose to go for the great speech of Archbishop Hubert.The comments
on the succession of John (i.189, Kerr) are singularly amusing, but
too long to quote.To prove the strictly hereditary
nature of the succession, Blackstone (i.189, Kerr) quotes the Statute
of 25 Edward III.“that the law of the Crown of England is, and always
hath been, that the children of the King of England, whether born in
England or elsewhere, ought to bear the inheritance after the death of
their ancestors.” We are bound to suppose that these learned lawyers
had read through the statute which they quoted; but it is wonderful
that they did not see that it had nothing whatever to do with fixing
the hereditary succession of the Crown.The original text (Revised
Statutes, i.176) runs thus:—

“La lei de la Corone Dengleterre est, et ad este touz jours tiele,
que les enfantz des Rois Dengleterre, _queu part qils soient neez en
Engleterre ou aillors_, sont ables et deivent porter heritage, apres la
mort lour auncestors.”

The object of the statute is something quite different from what any
one would think from Blackstone’s way of quoting it.The emphatic words
are those which are put in italics.The object of the statute is to
make the King’s children and others born of English parents beyond sea
capable of inheriting in England.As far as the succession to the Crown
is concerned, its effect is simply to put a child of the King born out
of the realm on a level with his brother born in the realm; that is,
in the view of our older Law, to give both alike the preference due to
an Ætheling.(34) It is as well to explain this, because most people seem to think
that a man becomes a Bishop by virtue of receiving a private letter
from the First Lord of the Treasury.We constantly see a man spoken of
as Bishop of such a see, and his works advertised as such, before a
single ecclesiastical or legal step has been taken to make him so.(36) The succession of a grandson, which first took place in England in
the case of Richard the Second, marks a distinct stage in the growth
of the doctrine of hereditary right.It involves the doctrine of
representation, which is a very subtle and technical one, and is not
nearly so obvious or so likely to occur in an early state of society
as the doctrine of nearness of kin.No opposition was made to the
accession of Richard the Second, but there seems to have been a strong
notion in men’s minds that John of Gaunt sought to displace his nephew.In earlier times, as the eldest and most eminent of the surviving sons
of Edward the Third, John would probably have been elected without any
thought of the claims of young Richard.(37) In Yorkist official language the three Lancastrian Kings were
usurpers, and Duke Richard was _de jure_, though not _de facto_, King.Henry the Sixth is, in the Act of 1461, “Henry Usurpour, late called
Kyng Henry the sixt.” The claim of the House of York was through an
intricate female descent from Lionel Duke of Clarence, a son of Edward
the Third older than John of Gaunt.A claim so purely technical had
never been set forth before; but we may be quite sure that it would not
have been thought to have much weight, if Duke Richard had not been, by
another branch, descended from Edward the Third in the male line, and
if he had not moreover been the ablest and most popular nobleman in the
country.(38) A prospective election before the vacancy of course hindered
any interregnum.In this case the formula “Le Roi est mort; vive le
Roi,” was perfectly true.The new King was already chosen and crowned,
and he had nothing to do but to go on reigning singly instead of in
partnership with his father, just as William went on reigning alone
after the death of Mary.In Germany this took place whenever a King
of the Romans was chosen in the lifetime of the reigning Emperor.In
France, under the early Kings of the Parisian dynasty, the practice
was specially common, and the fact that there seldom or never was an
interregnum doubtless helped much to make the French Crown become, as
it did, the most strictly hereditary crown in Christendom.In England,
the only distinct case of a coronation of a son during the lifetime of
his father was that of Henry, the son of Henry the Second, known as the
younger King, and sometimes as Henry the Third.In earlier times we get
something like it in the settlement of the Crown by Æthelwulf, with the
consent of his Witan (see Old-English History, 105, 106), but it does
not seem clear whether there was in this case any actual coronation
during the father’s lifetime.If there was not, this would be the case
most like that of Duke Richard.The compromise placed the Duke in the
same position as if he had been Prince of Wales, or rather in a better
position, for it might be held to shut out the need of even a formal
election on the King’s death.(39) See note 59 on Chapter II.(41) See Hallam’s Constitutional History, i.It is to be noticed
that the settlement enacts that “the inheritance of the Crown, &c.,
should remain in Henry the Seventh and the heirs of his body for ever,
and in none other.” This would seem to bar a great number of contingent
claims in various descendants of earlier Kings.As it happens, this Act
has been literally carried out, for every later Sovereign of England
has been a descendant of the body of Henry the Seventh.(42) The will of Henry the Eighth is fully discussed by Hallam, i.34,
288, 294; Lingard, vi.There are two Acts of Henry’s reign bearing
on the matter.7, the Crown is
entailed on the King’s sons by Jane Seymour or any other wife; then
on the King’s legitimate daughters, no names being mentioned; the Act
then goes on to say, “your Highnes shall have full and plenar power
and auctorite to geve despose appoynte assigne declare and lymytt by
your letters patentes under your great seale or ells by your laste Will
made in wrytynge and signed with your moste gracious hande, at your
onely pleasure from tyme to tyme herafter, the imperiall Crowne of this
Realme and all other the premisses thereunto belongyng, to be remayne
succede and come after your decease and for lack of lawfull heires of
your body to be procreated and begoten as is afore lymytted by this
Acte, to such person or persones in possession and remaynder as shall
please your Highnes and according to such estate and after such maner
forme facion ordre and condicion as shalbe expressed declared named and
lymytted in your said letters patentes or by your said laste will.”
The later Act, 35 Henry VIII.1, puts Henry’s two daughters, Mary
and Elizabeth, into the entail, but in a very remarkable way.The Acts
declaring their illegitimacy are not repealed, nor is the legitimacy of
either of them in any way asserted; in fact it is rather denied when
the preamble rehearses that “The king’s Majesty hath only issue of his
body lawfully begotten betwixt his Highness and his said late wife
Queen Jane the noble and excellent Prince Edward.” The Act then goes
on to enact that, although the King had been enabled to “dispose” the
Crown “to any person or persons of such estate therein as should please
his Highness to limit and appoint,” yet that, in failure of heirs of
the body of either the King or his son, “the said imperial Crown and
all other the premises shall be to the Lady Mary the King’s Highness
daughter, and to the heirs of the body of the same Lady Mary lawfully
begotten, with such conditions as by his Highness shall be limited by
his letters patents under his great seal, or by his Majesty’s last will
in writing signed with his gracious hand.” Failing Mary and her issue,
the same conditional entail is extended to Elizabeth and her issue.The
power of creating a remainder after the issue of Elizabeth of course
remained with Henry, and he exercised it in favour of the issue of his
younger sister Mary.Mary and Elizabeth therefore really reigned, not
by virtue of any royal descent, but by virtue of a particular entail by
which the Crown was settled on the King’s illegitimate daughters, as it
might have been settled on a perfect stranger.It was an attempt on the
part of Edward the Sixth to do without parliamentary authority what his
father had done by parliamentary authority which led to the momentary
occupation of the throne by Lady Jane Grey.Mary, on her accession,
raked up the whole story of her mother’s marriage and divorce, and the
Act of the first year of her reign recognized her as inheriting by
legitimate succession.The Act passed on the accession of Elizabeth,
1 Eliz.It enacts “that your majestie our sayd
Sovereigne Ladye ys and in verye dede and of most meere right ought
to bee by the Lawes of God and the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme
our most rightfull and lawfull Sovereigne liege Ladie and Quene; and
that your Highness ys rightlye lynyallye and lawfully discended and
come of the bloodd royall of this Realme of Englande in and to whose
princely person and theires of your bodye lawfully to bee begotten
after youe without all doubte ambiguitee scruple or question the
imperiall and Royall estate place crowne and dignitie of this Reallme
withe all honnours stiles titles dignities Regalities Jurisdiccons and
preheminences to the same nowe belonging & apperteyning arre & shalbee
most fully rightfully really & entierly invested & incorporated united
& annexed as rightfully & lawfully to all intentes construccons &
purposes as the same were in the said late Henrye theight or in the
late King Edwarde the Syxte your Highnes Brother, or in the late Quen
Marye your Highnes syster at anye tyme since thacte of parliament made
in the xxxvth yere of the reigne of your said most noble father king
Henrye theight.”

It should be remembered that Sir Thomas More, though he refused to
swear to the preamble of the oath prescribed by the Act of Supremacy,
was ready to swear to the order of succession which entailed the Crown
on the issue of Anne Boleyn.On his principles the issue of Anne Boleyn
would be illegitimate; but he also held that Parliament could settle
the Crown upon anybody, on an illegitimate child of the King or on an
utter stranger; to the succession therefore he had no objection to
swear.For a parallel to the extraordinary power thus granted to Henry we have
to go back to the days of Æthelwulf.(43) The position of the daughters of Henry the Eighth was of course
practically affected by the fact that each was the child of a mother
who was acknowledged as a lawful wife at the time of her daughter’s
birth.There was manifest harshness in ranking children so born with
ordinary illegitimate children; but, in strictness of Law, as Henry
married Anne Boleyn while Katharine of Aragon was alive, the daughter
of Katharine and the daughter of Anne could not both be legitimate.It should also be
remembered that the marriage of Anne Boleyn was declared void, and her
daughter declared illegitimate, on grounds—whatever they were—which had
nothing to do with the earlier question of the marriage and divorce of
Katharine.1, declares it to be treason “yf any person shall in any wyse holde
and affyrme or mayntayne that the Common Lawes of this Realme not
altred by Parlyament, ought not to dyrecte the Ryght of the crowne
of England, or that our said sovrayne Ladye Elizabeth the Quenes
Majestie that nowe is, with and by the aucthoritye of the Parlyament
of Englande is not able to make Lawes and Statutes of suffycyent force
and valyditie to lymit and bynd the Crowne of this Realme, and the
Descent Lymitacion Inheritaunce and Government thereof.” The like is
the crime of “whosoever shall hereafter duryng the Lyef of our said
Soveraigne Ladye, by any Booke or Worke prynted or written, dyrectly
and expresly declare and affyrme at any tyme before the same be by Acte
of Parlyament of this Realme established and affyrmed, that any one
particular person whosover it be, is or ought to be the ryght Heire
and Successor to the Queenes Majestie that nowe is (whome God longe
preserve) except the same be the naturall yssue of her Majesties bodye.”

This statute may possibly be taken as setting aside the claims of the
House of Suffolk; but, if so, it sets aside the claims of the House of
Stewart along with them.(45) James’s right was acknowledged by his own first Parliament, just
as the claims of other Kings who entered in an irregular way had
been.It should be marked however that he was crowned before he was
acknowledged.1, declares that “immediatelie upon
the Dissolution and Decease of Elizabeth late Queene of England, the
Imperiall Crowne of the Realme of England, and of all the Kingdomes
Dominions and Rights belonging to the same, did by inherent Birthright
and lawfull undoubted Succession, descend and come to your moste
excellent Majestie, as beinge lineallie justly and lawfullie next and
sole Heire of the Blood Royall of this Realme as is aforesaid.” It is
worth noticing that in this Act we get the following definition of
Parliament; “this high Court of Parliament, where all the whole Body of
the Realm and every particular member thereof, either in Person or by
Representation (upon their own free elections), are by the Laws of this
Realm deemed to be personally present.”

(46) The fact that James the First, a King who came in with no title
whatever but what was given him by an Act of Parliament passed after
his coronation, was acknowledged without the faintest opposition is
one of the most remarkable things in our history.294)
remarks that “there is much reason to believe that the consciousness of
this defect in his parliamentary title put James on magnifying, still
more than from his natural temper he was prone to do, the inherent
rights of primogenitory succession, as something indefeasible by the
legislature; a doctrine which, however it might suit the schools of
divinity, was in diametrical opposition to our statutes.” Certainly no
opposition can be more strongly marked than that between the language
of James’s own Parliament and the words quoted above from 13 Eliz.But see the remarks of Hallam a few pages before (i.288) on the
kind of tacit election by which it might be said that James reigned.“What renders it absurd to call him and his children usurpers?He had
that which the flatterers of his family most affected to disdain—the
will of the people; not certainly expressed in regular suffrage or
declared election, but unanimously and voluntarily ratifying that which
in itself could surely give no right, the determination of the late
Queen’s Council to proclaim his accession to the throne.”

(47) Whitelocke’s Memorials, 367.“The heads of the charge against the
King were published by leave, in this form: That Charles Stuart, being
admitted King of England, & therein trusted with a limited power, to
govern by, & according to the Laws of the Land, & not otherwise, &
by his trust being obliged, as also by his Oath, & office to use the
power committed to him, for the good & benefit of the people, & for the
preservation of their Rights and Privileges,” etc.At an earlier stage (365) the President had told the King that the
Court “sat here by the Authority of the Commons of England: & all your
predecessours, & you are responsible to them.” The King answered “I
deny that, shew me one Precedent.” The President, instead of quoting
the precedents which were at least plausible, told the prisoner that
he was not to interrupt the Court.Earlier still the King had objected
to the authority of the Court that “he saw no Lords there which should
make a Parliament, including the King, & urged that the Kingdom
of England was hereditary, & not successive.” The strong point of
Charles’s argument undoubtedly was the want of concurrence on the part
of the Lords.Both Houses of Parliament had agreed in the proceedings
against Edward the Second and Richard the Second.It is a small point, but it is well to notice that the description of
the King as Charles Stewart was perfectly accurate.Charles, the son
of James, the son of Henry Stewart Lord Darnley, really had a surname,
though it might not be according to Court etiquette to call him by
it.The helpless French imitators in 1793 summoned their King by the
name of “Louis Capet,” as if Charles had been summoned by the name of
“Unready,” “Bastard,” “Lackland,” “Longshanks,” or any other nickname
of an earlier King and forefather.I believe that many people fancy that Guelph or Welf is a surname of
the present, or rather late, royal family.(48) The Act 1 William and Mary (Revised Statutes, ii.11) entailed the
Crown “after their deceases,” “to the heires of the body of the said
princesse & for default of such issue to the Princesse Anne of Denmarke
& the heires of her body & for default of such issue to the heires of
the body of the said Prince of Orange.” It was only after the death of
“the most hopeful Prince William Duke of Gloucester” that the Crown
was settled (12 and 13 Will.94) on
“the most excellent Princess Sophia Electress and Dutchess Dowager of
Hannover, daughter of the most excellent Princess Elizabeth, late Queen
of Bohemia, daughter of our late sovereign lord King James the First of
happy memory,” “and the heirs of her body being protestants.”

(49) We hardly need assurance of the fact, but if it were needed,
something like an assurance to that effect was given by an official
member of the House during the session of 1872.At all events we
read in Sir T. E. May (ii.83); “The increased power of the House
of Commons, under an improved representation, has been patent and
indisputable.Responsible to the people, it has, at the same time,
wielded the people’s strength.No longer subservient to the crown, the
ministers, and the peerage, it has become the predominant authority
in the state.” But the following strange remark follows: “But it is
characteristic of the British constitution, and _a proof of its
freedom from the spirit of democracy_, that the more dominant the power
of the House of Commons,—the greater has been its respect for the law,
and the more carefully have its acts been restrained within the proper
limits of its own jurisdiction.”
