As the slate was subdivided
into thirty-six compartments, by either one of which it could be held,
and as there was a corresponding point, across which the bow could be
drawn, there were seventy-two primitive sounds that might be produced by
means of this simple contrivance.Each of these sounds inherently and
necessarily produced a different figure upon the slate, and there were
consequently just seventy-two initial letters in the Aztec alphabet.A word was pronounced by
the aged teacher at the front of the stage, written upon his slate,
exhibited to the scholar at the black tablet, and by him copied upon it.The whole class then drew down their bows, so as to produce the proper
sound, and the word itself, or its initial letter, was immediately
formed upon the slate.After the seventy-two primitive letters or sounds had been learned, the
next step was the art of combining them, so as not only to produce
single words, but very often whole sentences.Thus the first
hieroglyphic carved upon the tablet, on the back wall of the altar, in
Casa No.3 (forming the frontispiece of the second volume of Stephens's
Travels in Central America), expresses, within itself, the name, date of
birth, place of nativity, and parentage, of _Xixencotl_, the first king
of the twenty-third dynasty of the Aztecs.The hieroglyphics of the Aztecs are all of them both symbolical and
phonetic.Hence, in almost every one we observe, first, the primitive
sound or initial letter, and its various combinations; and, secondly,
some symbolic drawing, as a human face, for instance, or an eagle's
bill, or a fish, denoting some peculiar characteristic of the person or
thing delineated.The men and women on the stage
were placed there as critics upon the pronunciation of each articulate
sound.They were selected from the wisest men and best elocutionists in
the kingdom, and never failed to detect the slightest error in the
pronunciation of the tutor.The royal tongue of the Aztecs is the only one now in existence that is
based upon natural philosophy and the laws of sound.It appeals both to
the eye and ear of the speaker, and thus the nicest shades of thought
may be clearly expressed.There is no such thing as _stilted_ language
amongst them, and logomachy is unknown.And here I may be permitted to observe that a wider field for research
and discovery lies open in the domain of _sound_ than in any other
region of science.The laws of harmony, even, are but imperfectly
understood, and the most accomplished musicians are mere tyros in the
great science of acoustics.There is every reason to believe that there
is an intimate but yet undiscovered link between _number_, _light_, and
_sound_ whose solution will astonish and enlighten the generations that
are to succeed our own._When God spake the worlds into being, the
globular form they assumed was not accidental, nor arbitrary, but
depended essentially upon the tone of the great Architect, and the
medium in which it resounded._

Let the natural philosophers of the rising generation direct their
especial attention toward the fields I have indicated, and the rewards
awaiting their investigations will confer upon them immortality of fame.There is a reason why the musical scale should not mount in whole tones
up to the octave; why the mind grasps decimals easier than vulgar
fractions, and why, by the laws of light, the blood-red tint should be
heavier than the violet.Let Nature, in these departments, be studied
with the same care that Cuvier explored the organization of insects,
that Liebig deduced the property of acids, and that Leverrier computed
the orbit of that unseen world which his genius has half created, and
all the wonderful and beautiful secrets now on the eve of bursting into
being from the dark domain of sound, color, and shape, will at once
march forth into view, and take their destined places in the ranks of
human knowledge.Then the science of computation will be intuitive, as it was in the mind
of Zerah Colburn; the art of music creative, as in the plastic voices of
Jehovah; and the great principles of light and shape and color divine,
as in the genius of Swedenborg and the imagination of Milton.I have now completed the outline of the sketch, which in the foregoing
pages I proposed to lay before the world.The peculiar circumstances which led me to explore the remains of the
aboriginal Americans, the adventures attending me in carrying out that
design, the mode of my introduction into the Living City, spoken of by
Stephens, and believed in by so many thousands of enlightened men, and
above all, the wonderful and almost incredible character of the people I
there encountered, together with a rapid review of their language and
literature, have been briefly but faithfully presented to the public.It but remains for me now to present my readers with a few specimens of
Aztec literature, translated from the hieroglyphics now mouldering amid
the forests of Chiapa; to narrate the history of my escape from the
Living City of the aborigines; to bespeak a friendly word for the
forthcoming history of one of the earliest, most beautiful, and
unfortunate of the Aztec queens, copied _verbatim_ from the annals of
her race, and to bid them one and all, for the present, a respectful
adieu.Before copying from the blurred and water-soaked manuscript before me, a
single extract from the literary remains of the monumental race amongst
whom I have spent three years and a half of my early manhood, it may not
be deemed improper to remark that a large work upon this subject is now
in course of publication, containing the minutest details of the
domestic life, public institutions, language, and laws of that
interesting people.The extracts I present to the reader may be relied upon as exactly
correct, since they are taken from the memoranda made upon the spot.Directly in front of the throne, in the great audience-chamber described
in the preceding chapter, and written in the most beautiful hieroglyphic
extant, I found the following account of the origin of the land:

   The Great Spirit, whose emblem is the sun, held the water-drops
   out of which the world was made, in the hollow of his hand.He
   breathed a tone, and they rounded into the great globe, and
   started forth on the errand of counting up the years.Nothing existed but water and the great fishes of the sea.The Great Spirit sent a solid star, round and
   beautiful, but dead and no longer burning, and plunged it into
   the depths of the oceans.Then the winds were born, and the rains
   began to fall.They came
   up from the star-dust like wheat and maize.The round star
   floated upon the waters, and became the dry land; and the land
   was high, and its edges steep.It was circular, like a plate, and
   all connected together.The marriage of the land and the sea produced man, but his spirit
   came from the beams of the sun.Another eternity passed away, and the earth became too full of
   people.They were all white, because the star fell into the cold
   seas, and the sun could not darken their complexions.Then the sea bubbled up in the middle of the land, and the
   country of the Aztecs floated off to the west.Wherever the star
   cracked open, there the waters rose up and made the deep sea.When the east and the west come together again, they will fit
   like a garment that has been torn.Then followed a rough outline of the western coasts of Europe and
Africa, and directly opposite the coasts of North and South America.The projections of the one exactly fitted the indentations of the other,
and gave a semblance of truth and reality to the wild dream of the Aztec
philosopher.Let the geographer compare them, and he will be more
disposed to wonder than to sneer.I have not space enough left me to quote any further from the monumental
inscriptions, but if the reader be curious upon this subject, I
recommend to his attention the publication soon to come out, alluded to
above.#       #       #       #       #

Some unusual event certainly had occurred in the city.The great plaza
in front of the palace was thronged with a countless multitude of men
and women, all clamoring for a sacrifice!Whilst wondering what could be the cause of this commotion, I was
suddenly summoned before the Princess in the audience-chamber, so often
alluded to before.My surprise was great when, upon presenting myself before her, I beheld,
pinioned to a heavy log of mahogany, a young man, evidently of European
descent.The Princess requested me to interpret for her to the stranger, and the
following colloquy took place."Who are you, and why do you invade my dominions?""My name is Armand de L'Oreille.I was
sent out by Lamartine, in 1848, as attache to the expedition of M. de
Bourbourg, whose duties were to explore the forests in the neighborhood
of Palenque, to collate the language of the Central-American Indians, to
copy the inscriptions on the monuments, and, if possible, to reach the
LIVING CITY mentioned by Waldeck, Dupaix, and the American traveler
Stephens.""Most of them returned to Palenque, after wandering in the wilderness
a few days.Five only determined to proceed; of that number I am the
only survivor."The council and the queen were not long in determining the fate of M. de
L'Oreille.It was unanimously resolved that he should surrender his life
as a forfeit to his temerity.The next morning, at sunrise, was fixed for his death.He was to be
sacrificed upon the altar, on the summit of the great Teocallis--an
offering to _Quetzalcohuatl_, the first great prince of the Aztecs.I at
once determined to save the life of the stranger, if I could do so, even
at the hazard of my own.I retired
earlier than usual, and lay silent and moody, revolving on the best
means to accomplish my end.Midnight at length arrived; I crept stealthily from my bed, and opened
the door of my chamber, as lightly as sleep creeps over the eyelids of
children.is so blotted, and saturated with saltwater, as to be
illegible for several pages.The next legible sentences are as
follows.--ED.]Here, for the first time, the woods looked familiar to me.Proceeding a
few steps, I fell into the trail leading toward the modern village of
Palenque, and, after an hour's walk, I halted in front of the _cabilda_
of the town.I was followed by a motley crowd to the office of the Alcalde, who did
not recognize me, dressed as I was in skins, and half loaded down with
rolls of MS., made from the bark of the mulberry.I related to him and
M. de Bourbourg my adventures; and though the latter declared he had
lost poor Armand and his five companions, yet I am persuaded that
neither of them credited a single word of my story.Not many days after my safe arrival at Palenque, I seized a favorable
opportunity to visit the ruins of _Casa Grande_.I readily found the
opening to the subterranean passage heretofore described, and after some
troublesome delays at the various landing-places, I finally succeeded in
reaching the very spot whence I had ascended on that eventful night,
nearly three years before, in company with the Aztec Princess.After exploring many of the mouldering and half-ruined apartments of
this immense palace, I accidentally entered a small room, that at first
seemed to have been a place of sacrifice; but, upon closer inspection, I
ascertained that, like many of those in the "Living City," it was a
chapel dedicated to the memory of some one of the princes of the Aztec
race.In order to interpret the inscriptions with greater facility, I lit six
or seven candles, and placed them in the best positions to illuminate
the hieroglyphics.Then turning, to take a view of the grand tablet in
the middle of the inscription, my astonishment was indescribable, when I
beheld the exact features, dress and _panache_ of the Aztec maiden,
carved in the everlasting marble before me._THE MOTHER'S EPISTLE._


    Sweet daughter, leave thy tasks and toys,
      Throw idle thoughts aside,
    And hearken to a mother's voice,
      That would thy footsteps guide;
    Though far across the rolling seas,
      Beyond the mountains blue,
    She sends her counsels on the breeze,
      And wafts her blessings too.To guard thy voyage o'er life's wave,
      To guide thy bark aright,
    To snatch thee from an early grave,
      And gild thy way with light,
    Thy mother calls thee to her side,
      And takes thee on her knee,
    In spite of oceans that divide,
      And thus addresses thee:


                   I.

    Learn first this lesson in thy youth,
      Which time cannot destroy,
    To love and speak and act the truth--
      'Tis life's most holy joy;
    Wert thou a queen upon a throne,
      Decked in each royal gem,
    This little jewel would alone
      Outshine thy diadem.Next learn to conquer, as they rise,
      Each wave of passion's sea;
    Unchecked, 'twill sweep the vaulted skies,
      And vanquish heaven and thee;
    Lashed on by storms within thy breast,
      These billows of the soul
    Will wreck thy peace, destroy thy rest,
      And ruin as they roll!But conquered passions were no gain,
      Unless where once they grew
    There falls the teardrop, like the rain,
      And gleams the morning dew;
    Sow flowers within thy virgin heart,
      That spring from guileless love;
    Extend to each a sister's part,
      Take lessons of the dove.But, daughter, empty were our lives,
      And useless all our toils,
    If that within us, which survives
      Life's transient battle-broils,
    Were all untaught in heavenly lore,
      Unlearned in virtue's ways,
    Ungifted with religion's store,
      Unskilled our God to praise.V.

    Take for thy guide the Bible old,
      Consult its pages fair
    Within them glitter gems and gold,
      Repentance, Faith, and Prayer;
    Make these companions of thy soul;
      Where e'er thy footsteps roam,
    And safely shalt thou reach thy goal,
      In heaven--the angel's home!_LEGENDS OF LAKE BIGLER._


I.--THE HAUNTED ROCK.A great many years ago, ere the first white man had trodden the soil of
the American continent, and before the palaces of Uxmal and Palenque
were masses of shapeless ruins--whilst the splendid structures, now
lining the banks of the Gila with broken columns and fallen domes were
inhabited by a nobler race than the cowardly Pimos or the Ishmaelitish
Apaches, there lived and flourished on opposite shores of Lake Bigler
two rival nations, disputing with each other for the supremacy of this
inland sea, and making perpetual war in order to accomplish the object
of their ambition.The tribe dwelling upon the western shore was called the Ako-ni-tas,
whilst those inhabiting what is now the State of Nevada were known by
the name of Gra-so-po-itas.Each nation was subdivided into smaller
principalities, over which subordinate sachems, or chiefs, presided.In
number, physical appearance, and advance in the arts of civilization,
both very much resembled, and neither could be said to have decidedly
the pre-eminence.At the time my story commences, Wan-ta-tay-to was principal chief or
king of the Ako-ni-tas, or, as they were sometimes designated,
O-kak-o-nitas, whilst Rhu-tog-au-di presided over the destinies of the
Gra-so-po-itas.The language spoken by these tribes were dialects of
the same original tongue, and could be easily understood the one by the
other.Continued intercourse, even when at war, had assimilated their
customs, laws and religion to such a degree that it often became a
matter of grave doubt as to which tribe occasional deserters belonged.Intermarriage between the tribes was strictly forbidden, and punished
with death in all cases, no matter what might be the rank, power or
wealth of the violators of the law.At this era the surface of the lake was about sixty feet higher than at
the present time.Constant evaporation, or perhaps the wearing channel
of the Truckee, has contributed to lower the level of the water, and the
same causes still continue in operation, as is clearly perceptible by
the watermarks of previous years.Thousands of splendid canoes
everywhere dotted its surface; some of them engaged in the peaceful
avocations of fishing and hunting, whilst the large majority were manned
and armed for immediate and deadly hostilities.The year preceding that in which the events occurred herein related, had
been a very disastrous one to both tribes.A great many deaths had
ensued from casualties in battle; but the chief source of disaster had
been a most terrific hurricane, which had swept over the lake,
upsetting, sinking, and destroying whole fleets of canoes, with all
persons aboard at the time.Amongst the lost were both the royal barges,
with the sons and daughters of the chiefs.The loss had been so
overwhelming and general that the chief of the O-kak-o-nitas had but one
solitary representative of the line royal left, and that was a beloved
daughter named Ta-kem-ena.The rival chieftain was equally unfortunate,
for his entire wigwam had perished with the exception of Mo-ca-ru-po,
his youngest son.But these great misfortunes, instead of producing
peace and good-will, as a universal calamity would be sure to do in an
enlightened nation, tended only to embitter the passions of the hostile
kings and lend new terrors to the war.At once made aware of what the
other had suffered, each promulgated a sort of proclamation, offering an
immense reward for the scalp of his rival's heir.Wan-ta-tay-to declared that he would give one half his realm to
whomsoever brought the body of Mo-ca-ru-po, dead or alive, within his
lines; and Rhu-tog-au-di, not to be outdone in extravagance, registered
an oath that whosoever captured Ta-kem-ena, the beautiful daughter of
his enemy, should be rewarded with her patrimonial rights, and also be
associated with him in ruling his own dominions.As is universally the case with all American Indians, the females are
equally warlike and sometimes quite as brave as the males.Ta-kem-ena
was no exception to this rule, and she accordingly made instant
preparations to capture or kill the heir to the throne of her enemy.For
this purpose she selected a small, light bark canoe, and resolved all
alone to make the attempt.Nor did she communicate her intention to any
one else.Her father, even, was kept in profound ignorance of his
daughter's design.About the same time, a desire for fame, and a thirsting for supreme
power, allured young Mo-ca-ru-po into the lists of those who became
candidates for the recent reward offered by his father.He, too,
determined to proceed alone.It was just at midnight, of a beautiful moonlight evening, that the
young scions of royalty set forth from opposite shores of the lake, and
stealthily paddled for the dominions of their enemies.When about half
across the boats came violently into collision.The light of the full moon, riding at mid-heavens,
fell softly upon the features of the Princess, and at the same time
illuminated those of the young Prince.The blows from the uplifted battle-axes failed to descend.The poisoned
arrows were returned to their quivers.Surprise gave place quickly to
admiration--that to something more human--pity followed close in the
rear, and love, triumphant everywhere, paralyzed the muscles, benumbed
the faculties, and captured the souls of his victims.Pouring a handful
of the pure water of the lake upon each other's heads, as a pledge of
love, and a ceremonial of marriage, in another moment the two were
locked in each other's arms, made man and wife by the yearnings of the
soul, and by a destiny which naught but Omnipotent Power could avert.What were the commands of kings, their threats, or their punishments, in
the scale with youth, and hope, and love?Never did those transparent waters leap more lightly beneath the
moonbeams than upon this auspicious night.Hate, revenge, fame, power,
all were forgotten in the supreme delights of love.Who, indeed, would not be a lover?The future takes the hue of the
rainbow, and spans the whole earth with its arch.The past fades into
instant oblivion, and its dark scenes are remembered no more.Every
beautiful thing looks lovelier--spring's breath smells sweeter--the
heavens bend lower--the stars shine brighter.The eyes, the lips, the
smiles of the loved one, bankrupt all nature.The diamond's gleam, the
flower's blush, the fountain's purity, are all _her_ own!The antelope's
swiftness, the buffalo's strength, the lion's bravery, are but the
reflex of _his_ manly soul!Fate thus had bound these two lovers in indissoluble bonds: let us now
see what it had left in reserve.The plashing of paddles aroused the lovers from their caressing.Quickly
leaping into his own boat, side by side, they flew over the exultant
waves, careless for the moment whither they went, and really aimless in
their destination.Having safely eluded their pursuers, if such they
were, the princes now consulted as to their future course.After long
and anxious debate it was finally determined that they should part for
the present, and would each night continue to meet at midnight at the
majestic rock which towered up from the waves high into the heavens, not
far from what is now known as Pray's Farm, that being the residence and
headquarters of the O-kak-oni-ta tribe.Accordingly, after many protestations of eternal fidelity, and warned by
the ruddy gleam along the eastern sky, they parted.Night after night, for many weeks and months, the faithful lovers met at
the appointed place, and proved their affection by their constancy.They
soon made the discovery that the immense rock was hollow, and contained
a magnificent cave.Here, safe from all observation, the tardy months
rolled by, both praying for peace, yet neither daring to mention a
termination of hostilities to their sires.Finally, the usual
concomitants of lawful wedlock began to grow manifest in the rounded
form of the Princess--in her sadness, her drooping eyes, and her
perpetual uneasiness whilst in the presence of her father.Not able any
longer to conceal her griefs, they became the court scandal, and she
was summoned to the royal presence and required to name her lover.This,
of course, she persisted in refusing, but spies having been set upon her
movements, herself and lover were surrounded and entrapped in the fatal
cave.In vain did she plead for the life of the young prince, regardless of
her own.An embassador was sent to Rhu-tog-au-di,
announcing the treachery of his son, and inviting that chief to be
present at the immolation of both victims.He willingly consented to
assist in the ceremonies.A grand council of the two nations was
immediately called, in order to determine in what manner the death
penalty should be inflicted.After many and grave debates, it was
resolved that the lovers should be incarcerated in the dark and gloomy
cave where they had spent so many happy hours, and there starve to
death.It was a grand gala-day with the O-kak-oni-tas and the Gra-sop-o-itas.The mighty chiefs had been reconciled, and the wealth, power and beauty
of the two realms turned out in all the splendor of fresh paint and
brilliant feathers, to do honor to the occasion.The young princes were
to be put to death.The lake in the vicinity of the rock was alive with
canoes.The hills in the neighborhood were crowded with spectators.The
two old kings sat in the same splendid barge, and followed close after
the bark canoe in which the lovers were being conveyed to their living
tomb.Silently they gazed into each other's faces and smiled.For each
other had they lived; with one another were they now to die.Without
food, without water, without light, they were hurried into their bridal
chamber, and huge stones rolled against the only entrance.Evening after evening the chiefs sat upon the grave portals of their
children.At first they were greeted with loud cries, extorted by the
gnawing of hunger and the agony of thirst.Gradually the cries gave way
to low moans, and finally, after ten days had elapsed, the tomb became
as silent as the lips of the lovers.Then the huge stones were, by the
command of the two kings, rolled away, and a select body of warriors
ordered to enter and bring forth their lifeless forms.But the west wind
had sprung up, and just as the stones were taken from the entrance, a
low, deep, sorrowful sigh issued from the mouth of the cave.Startled
and terrified beyond control, the warriors retreated hastily from the
spot; and the weird utterances continuing, no warriors could be found
brave enough to sound the depths of that dreadful sepulchre.Day after
day canoes crowded about the mouth of the cave, and still the west wind
blew, and still the sighs and moans continued to strike the souls of the
trembling warriors.In paddling past they would
always veer their canoes seaward, and hurry past with all the speed they
could command.Centuries passed away; the level of the lake had sunk many feet; the
last scions of the O-kak-oni-tas and the Gra-sop-o-itas had mouldered
many years in the burying-grounds of their sires, and a new race had
usurped their old hunting grounds.Still no one had ever entered the
haunted cave.One day, late in the autumn of 1849, a company of emigrants on their way
to California, were passing, toward evening, the month of the cavern,
and hearing a strange, low, mournful sigh, seeming to issue thence, they
landed their canoe and resolved to solve the mystery.Lighting some
pitch-pine torches, they proceeded cautiously to explore the cavern.For
a long time they could discern nothing.At length, in the furthest
corner of the gloomy recess, they found two human skeletons, with their
bony arms entwined, and their fleshless skulls resting upon each other's
bosoms.The lovers are dead, but the old cave still echoes with their
dying sobs.II.--DICK BARTER'S YARN; OR, THE LAST OF THE MERMAIDS.Well, Dick began, you see I am an old salt, having sailed the seas for
more than forty-nine years, and being entirely unaccustomed to living
upon the land.By some accident or other, I found myself, in the winter
of 1849, cook for a party of miners who were sluicing high up the North
Fork of the American.We had a hard time all winter, and when spring
opened, it was agreed that I and a comrade named Liehard should cross
the summit and spend a week fishing at the lake.We took along an old
Washoe Indian, who spoke Spanish, as a guide.This old man had formerly
lived on the north margin of the lake, near where Tahoe City is now
situated, and was perfectly familiar with all the most noted fishing
grounds and chief points of interest throughout its entire circuit.We had hardly got started before he commenced telling us of a remarkable
struggle, which he declared had been going on for many hundred years
between a border tribe of Indians and the inhabitants of the lake, whom
he designated as Water-men, or "_hombres de las aguas_."On asking if he
really meant to say that human beings lived and breathed like fish in
Lake Bigler, he declared without any hesitation that such was the fact;
that he had often seen them; and went on to describe a terrific combat
he witnessed a great many years ago, between a Pol-i-<DW76> chief and _a
man of the water_.On my expressing some doubt as to the veracity of the
statement, he proffered to show us the very spot where it occurred; and
at the same time expressed a belief that by manufacturing a whistle from
the bark of the mountain chinquapin, and blowing it as the Pol-i-<DW76>s
did, we might entice some of their old enemies from the depths of the
lake.My curiosity now being raised tip-toe, I proceeded to interrogate
Juan more closely, and in answer I succeeded in obtaining the following
curious particulars:

The tribe of border Indians called the Pol-i-<DW76>s were a sort of
amphibious race, and a hybrid between the Pi-Utes and the mermaids of
the lake.They were of a much lighter color than their progenitors, and
were distinguished by a great many peculiar characteristics.Exceedingly
few in number, and quarrelsome in the extreme, they resented every
intrusion upon the waters of the lake as a personal affront, and made
perpetual war upon neighboring tribes.Hence, as Juan remarked, they
soon became extinct after the invasion of the Washoes.The last of them
disappeared about twenty-five years ago.The most noted of their
peculiarities were the following:

First.Their heads were broad and extremely flat; the eyes protuberant,
and the ears scarcely perceptible--being a small opening closed by a
movable valve shaped like the scale of a salmon.Their mouths were very
large, extending entirely across the cheeks, and bounded by a hard rim
of bone, instead of the common lip.In appearance, therefore, the head
did not look unlike an immense catfish head, except there were no fins
about the jaws, and no feelers, as we call them.Their necks were short, stout, and chubby, and they possessed
the power of inflating them at will, and thus distending them to two or
three times their ordinary size.Their bodies were long, round, and flexible.When wet, they
glistened in the sun like the back of an eel, and seemed to possess much
greater buoyancy than those of common men.But the greatest wonder of
all was a kind of loose membrane, that extended from beneath their
shoulders all the way down their sides, and connected itself with the
upper portion of their thighs.This loose skin resembled the wings of
the common house bat, and when spread out, as it always did in the
water, looked like the membrane lining of the legs and fore feet of the
chipmunk.The hands and feet were distinguished for much greater length of
toe and finger; and their extremities grew together like the toes of a
duck, forming a complete web betwixt all the fingers and toes.The Pol-i-<DW76>s lived chiefly upon fish and oysters, of which there was
once a great abundance in the lake.They were likewise cannibals, and
ate their enemies without stint or compunction.A young Washoe girl was
considered a feast, but a lake maiden was the _ne plus ultra_ of
luxuries.The Washoes reciprocated the compliment, and fattened upon the
blubber of the Pol-i-<DW76>s.It is true that they were extremely difficult
to capture, for, when hotly pursued, they plunged into the lake, and by
expert swimming and extraordinary diving, they generally managed to
effect their escape.Juan having exhausted his budget concerning the Pol-i-<DW76>s, I requested
him to give us as minute a description of the Lake Mermaids.This he
declined for the present to do, alleging as an excuse that we would
first attempt to capture, or at least to see one for ourselves, and if
our hunt was unsuccessful, he would then gratify our curiosity.It was some days before we came in sight of this magnificent sheet of
water.Finally, however, after many perilous adventures in descending
the Sierras, we reached the margin of the lake.Our first care was to
procure trout enough to last until we got ready to return.That was an
easy matter, for in those days the lake was far more plentifully
supplied than at present.We caught many thousands at a place where a
small brook came down from the mountains, and formed a pool not a great
distance from its entrance into the lake, and this pool was alive with
them.It occupied us but three days to catch, clean, and sun-dry as many
as our single mule could carry, and having still nearly a week to spare
we determined to start off in pursuit of the mermaids.Our guide faithfully conducted us to the spot where he beheld the
conflict between the last of the Pol-i-<DW76>s and one of the water-men.As
stated above, it is nearly on the spot where Tahoe City now stands.The
battle was a fierce one, as the combatants were equally matched in
strength and endurance, and was finally terminated only by the
interposition of a small party of Washoes, our own guide being of the
number.The struggle was chiefly in the water, the Pol-i-<DW76> being
better able to swim than the mermaid was to walk.Still, as occasion
required, a round or two took place on the gravelly beach.Never did old
Spain and England engage in fiercer conflict for the dominion of the
seas, than now occurred between Pol-i-<DW76> and Merman for the mastery of
the lake.Each fought, as the Roman fought, for Empire.The Pol-i-<DW76>,
like the last of the Mohicans, had seen his tribe melt away, until he
stood, like some solitary column at Persepolis, the sole monument of a
once gorgeous temple.The water chieftain also felt that upon his arm,
or rather tail, everything that made life desirable was staked.Above
all, the trident of his native sea was involved.The weapons of the Pol-i-<DW76> were his teeth and his hind legs.Those of
the Merman were all concentrated in the flop of his scaly tail.With the
energy of a dying alligator, he would encircle, with one tremendous
effort, the bruised body of the Pol-i-<DW76>, and floor him beautifully on
the beach.Recovering almost instantly, the Pol-i-<DW76> would seize the
Merman by the long black hair, kick him in the region of the stomach,
and grapple his windpipe between his bony jaws, as the mastiff does the
infuriated bull.Finally, after a great many unsuccessful attempts to drag the Pol-i-<DW76>
into deep water, the mermaid was seized by her long locks and suddenly
jerked out upon the beach in a very battered condition.At this moment,
the Washoes with a yell rushed toward the combatants, but the Pol-i-<DW76>
seeing death before him upon water and land equally, preferred the
embraces of the water nymphs to the stomachs of the landsmen, and
rolling over rapidly was soon borne off into unfathomable depths by the
triumphant Merman.It resembled the condition of the ancient
Britons, who, being crowded by the Romans from the sea, and attacked by
the Picts from the interior, lamented their fate as the most unfortunate
of men."The Romans," they said, "drive us into the land; there we are
met by the Picts, who in turn drive us into the sea.Those whom enemies spare, the waves devour."Our first step was to prepare a chinquapin whistle.The flute was easily
manufactured by Juan himself, thuswise: He cut a twig about eighteen
inches in length, and not more than half an inch in diameter, and
peeling the bark from the ends an inch or so, proceeded to rub the bark
rapidly with a dry stick peeled perfectly smooth.In a short time the
sap in the twig commenced to exude from both ends.Then placing the
large end between his teeth he pulled suddenly, and the bark slipped off
with a crack in it.Then cutting a small hole in the form of a
parallelogram, near the upper end, he adjusted a stopper with flattened
surface so as to fit exactly the opening.Cutting off the end of the
stopple even with the bark and filling the lower opening nearly full of
clay, he declared the work was done.As a proof of this, he blew into
the hollow tube, and a low, musical sound was emitted, very flute-like
and silvery.When blown harshly, it could be heard at a great distance,
and filled the air with melodious echoes.Thus equipped, we set out upon our search.The first two days were spent
unsuccessfully.On the third we found ourselves near what is now called
Agate Beach.At this place a small cove indents the land, which sweeps
round in the form of a semi-circle.The shore is literally packed with
agates and crystals.We dug some more than two feet deep in several
places, but still could find no bottom to the glittering floor.They are
of all colors, but the prevailing hues are red and yellow.Here Juan
paused, and lifting his whistle to his lips, he performed a multitude of
soft, gentle airs, which floated across the calm waves like a lover's
serenade breathes o'er the breast of sleeping beauty.We had now entirely circumnavigated the lake, and were on the eve
of despairing utterly, when suddenly we beheld the surface of the lake,
nearly a quarter of a mile from the shore, disturbed violently, as if
some giant whale were floundering with a harpoon in its side.In a
moment more the head and neck of one of those tremendous serpents that
of late years have infested the lake, were uplifted some ten or fifteen
feet above the surface.Almost at the same instant we beheld the head,
face and hair, as of a human being, emerge quickly from the water, and
look back toward the pursuing foe.The truth flashed upon us
instantaneously.Here was a mermaid pursued by a serpent.On they came,
seemingly regardless of our presence, and had approached to within
twenty yards of the spot where we stood, when suddenly both came to a
dead halt.Juan had never ceased for a moment to blow his tuneful flute,
and it now became apparent that the notes had struck their hearing at
the same time.To say that they were charmed would but half express
their ecstatic condition.The huge old serpent lolled along the waters for a hundred feet or so,
and never so much as shook the spray from his hide.He looked like
Milton's portrait of Satan, stretched out upon the burning marl of hell.In perfect contrast with the sea monster, the beautiful mermaiden lifted
her pallid face above the water, dripping with the crystal tears of the
lake, and gathering her long raven locks, that floated like the train of
a meteor down her back, she carelessly flung them across her swelling
bosom, as if to reproach us for gazing upon her beauteous form.If she were entranced by the music, I was
not less so with her beauty.Presently the roseate hues of a dying
dolphin played athwart her brow and cheeks, and ere long a gentle sigh,
as if stolen from the trembling chords of an Eolian harp, issued from
her coral lips.Again and again it broke forth, until it beat in full
symphony with the cadences of Juan's rustic flute.My attention was at this moment aroused by the suspicious clicking of my
comrade's rifle.Turning around suddenly, I beheld Liehard, with his
piece leveled at the unconscious mermaid.But the
warning came too late, for instantaneously the quick report of his rifle
and the terrific shriek of the mermaid broke the noontide stillness;
and, rearing her bleeding form almost entirely out of the water, she
plunged headlong forwards, a corpse.Beholding his prey, powerless
within his grasp, the serpent splashed toward her, and, ere I could cock
my rifle, he had seized her unresisting body, and sank with it into the
mysterious caverns of the lake.At this instant, I gave a loud outcry,
as if in pain.On opening my eyes, my wife was bending over me, the
midday sun was shining in my face, Dick Barter was spinning some
confounded yarn about the Bay of Biscay and the rum trade of Jamaica,
and the sloop _Edith Beaty_ was still riding at anchor off the wild
glen, and gazing tranquilly at her ugly image in the crystal mirror of
Lake Bigler.[Decoration]

X._ROSENTHAL'S ELAINE._


    I stood and gazed far out into the waste;
    No dip of oar broke on the listening ear;
    But the quick rippling of the inward flood
    Gave warning of approaching argosy.Adown the west, the day's last fleeting gleam
    Faded and died, and left the world in gloom.Hope hung no star up in the murky east
    To cheer the soul, or guide the pilgrim's way.Black frown'd the heavens, and black the answering earth
    Reflected from her watery wastes the night.Once again
    The dripping oar dipped in its silver blade,
    Parting the waves, as smiles part beauty's lips.Betwixt me and the curtain of the cloud,
    Close down by the horizon's verge, there crept
    From out the darkness, barge and crew and freight,
    Sailless and voiceless, all!Then I knew
    I stood upon the brink of Time.I saw
    Before me Death's swift river sweep along
    And bear its burden to the grave.One seamew screamed, in solitary woe;
    "Elaine!stole back the echo, weird
    And musical, from off the further shore.Then burst a chorus wild, "Elaine!And gazing upward through the twilight haze,
    Mine eyes beheld King Arthur's phantom Court.There stood the sturdy monarch: he who drove
    The hordes of Hengist from old Albion's strand;
    And, leaning on his stalwart arm, his queen,
    The fair, the false, but trusted Guinevere!And there, like the statue of a demi-god,
    In marble wrought by some old Grecian hand,
    With eyes downcast, towered Lancelot of the Lake.Lavaine and Torre, the heirs of Astolat,
    And he, the sorrowing Sire of the Dead,
    Together with a throng of valiant knights
    And ladies fair, were gathered as of yore,
    At the Round Table of bold Arthur's Court.There, too, was Tristram, leaning on his lance,
    Whose eyes alone of all that weeping host
    Swam not in tears; but indignation burned
    Red in their sockets, like volcanic fires,
    And from their blazing depths a Fury shot
    Her hissing arrows at the guilty pair.Then Lancelot, advancing to the front,
    With glance transfixed upon the canvas true
    That sheds immortal fame on ROSENTHAL,
    Thus chanted forth his Requiem for the Dead:

        Fresh as the water in the fountain,
          Fair as the lily by its side,
        Pure as the snow upon the mountain,
                  Is the angel
                    Elaine!Day after day she grew fairer,
          As she pined away in sorrow, at my side;
        No pearl in the ocean could be rarer
                 Than the angel
                    Elaine!The hours passed away all unheeded,
          For love hath no landmarks in its tide.No child of misfortune ever pleaded
                    In vain
                   To Elaine!Here, where sad Tamesis is rolling
         The wave of its sorrow-laden tide,
       Forever on the air is heard tolling
                   The refrain
                   Of Elaine![Decoration]

XI._THE TELESCOPIC EYE._

A LEAF FROM A REPORTER'S NOTE-BOOK.For the past five or six weeks, rumors of a strange abnormal development
of the powers of vision of a youth named Johnny Palmer, whose parents
reside at South San Francisco, have been whispered around in scientific
circles in the city, and one or two short notices have appeared in the
columns of some of our contemporaries relative to the prodigious _lusus
naturae_, as the scientists call it.Owing to the action taken by the California College of Sciences, whose
members comprise some of our most scientific citizens, the affair has
assumed such importance as to call for a careful and exhaustive
investigation.Being detailed to investigate the flying stories, with regard to the
powers of vision claimed for a lad named John or "Johnny" Palmer, as his
parents call him, we first of all ventured to send in our card to
Professor Gibbins, the President of the California College of Sciences.It is always best to call at the fountain-head for useful information, a
habit which our two hundred thousand readers on this coast can never
fail to see and appreciate.An estimable gentleman of the African
persuasion, to whom we handed our "pasteboard," soon returned with the
polite message, "Yes, sir; _in_.And so we followed our
conductor through several passages almost as dark as the face of the
_cicerone_, and in a few moments found ourselves in the presence of,
perhaps, the busiest man in the city of San Francisco.Without any flourish of trumpets, the Professor inquired our object in
seeking him and the information we desired."Ah," said he, "that is a
long story.I have no time to go into particulars just now.I am
computing the final sheet of Professor Davidson's report of the Transit
of Venus, last year, at Yokohama and Loo-Choo.It must be ready before
May, and it requires six months' work to do it correctly.""But," I rejoined, "can't you tell me where the lad is to be found?""And if I did, they will not let you see him.""Let me alone for that," said I, smiling; "a reporter, like love, finds
his way where wolves would fear to tread.""Really, my dear sir," quickly responded the Doctor, "I have no time to
chat this morning.Our special committee submitted its report yesterday,
which is on file in that book-case; and if you will promise not to
publish it until after it has been read in open session of the College,
you may take it to your sanctum, run it over, and clip from it enough to
satisfy the public for the present."Saying this, he rose from his seat, opened the case, took from a
pigeon-hole a voluminous written document tied up with red tape, and
handed it to me, adding, "Be careful!"Seating himself without another
word, he turned his back on me, and I sallied forth into the street.Reaching the office, I scrutinized the writing on the envelope, and
found it as follows: "Report of Special Committee--Boy
Palmer--Vision--Laws of Light--Filed February 10, 1876--Stittmore,
Sec."Opening the document, I saw at once that it was a full, accurate,
and, up to the present time, complete account of the phenomenal case I
was after, and regretted the promise made not to publish the entire
report until read in open session of the College.Therefore, I shall be
compelled to give the substance of the report in my own words, only
giving _verbatim_ now and then a few scientific phrases which are not
fully intelligible to me, or susceptible of circumlocution in common
language.The report is signed by Doctors Bryant, Gadbury and Golson, three of our
ablest medical men, and approved by Professor Smyth, the oculist.So
far, therefore, as authenticity and scientific accuracy are concerned,
our readers may rely implicitly upon the absolute correctness of every
fact stated and conclusion reached.The first paragraph of the report gives the name of the child, "John
Palmer, age, nine years, and place of residence, South San Francisco,
Culp Hill, near Catholic Orphan Asylum;" and then plunges at once into
_in medias res_.It appears that the period through which the investigation ran was only
fifteen days; but it seems to have been so thorough, by the use of the
ophthalmoscope and other modern appliances and tests, that no regrets
ought to be indulged as to the brevity of the time employed in
experiments.Besides, we have superadded a short and minute account of
our own, verifying some of the most curious facts reported, with several
tests proposed by ourselves and not included in the statement of the
scientific committee.To begin, then, with the beginning of the inquiries by the committee.They were conducted into a small back room, darkened by old blankets
hung up at the window, for the purpose of the total exclusion of
daylight; an absurd remedy for blindness, recommended by a noted quack
whose name adorns the extra fly-leaf of the San Francisco _Truth
Teller_.The lad was reclining upon an old settee, ill-clad and almost
idiotic in expression.As the committee soon ascertained, his mother
only was at home, the father being absent at his customary
occupation--that of switch-tender on the San Jose Railroad.She notified
her son of the presence of strangers and he rose and walked with a firm
step toward where the gentlemen stood, at the entrance of the room.He
shook them all by the hand and bade them good morning.In reply to
questions rapidly put and answered by his mother, the following account
of the infancy of the boy and the accidental discovery of his
extraordinary powers of vision was given:

He was born in the house where the committee found him, nine years ago
the 15th of last January.Nothing of an unusual character occurred until
his second year, when it was announced by a neighbor that the boy was
completely blind, his parents never having been suspicious of the fact
before that time, although the mother declared that for some months
anterior to the discovery she had noticed some acts of the child that
seemed to indicate mental imbecility rather than blindness.From this
time forward until a few months ago nothing happened to vary the boy's
existence except a new remedy now and then prescribed by neighbors for
the supposed malady.He was mostly confined to a darkened chamber, and
was never trusted alone out of doors.He grew familiar, by touch and
sound, with the forms of most objects about him, and could form very
accurate guesses of the color and texture of them all.His
conversational powers did not seem greatly impaired, and he readily
acquired much useful knowledge from listening attentively to everything
that was said in his presence.He was quite a musician, and touched the
harmonicon, banjo and accordeon with skill and feeling.He was unusually
sensitive to the presence of light, though incapable of seeing any
object with any degree of distinctness; and hence the attempt to exclude
light as the greatest enemy to the recovery of vision.It was very
strange that up to the time of the examination of the committee, no
scientific examination of the boy's eye had been made by a competent
oculist, the parents contenting themselves with the chance opinions of
visitors or the cheap nostrums of quacks.It is perhaps fortunate for
science that this was the case, as a cure for the eye might have been an
extinction of its abnormal power.On the evening of the 12th of December last (1875), the position of the
child's bed was temporarily changed to make room for a visitor.The bed
was placed against the wall of the room, fronting directly east, with
the window opening at the side of the bed next to the head.The boy was
sent to bed about seven o'clock, and the parents and their visitor were
seated in the front room, spending the evening in social intercourse.The moon rose full and cloudless about half-past seven o'clock, and
shone full in the face of the sleeping boy.Something aroused him from slumber, and when he opened his eyes the
first object they encountered was the round disk of her orb.By some
oversight the curtain had been removed from the window, and probably for
the first time in his life he beheld the lustrous queen of night
swimming in resplendent radiance, and bathing hill and bay in effulgent
glory.Uttering a cry, equally of terror and delight, he sprang up in
bed and sat there like a statue, with eyes aglare, mouth open, finger
pointed, and astonishment depicted on every feature.His sudden, sharp
scream brought his mother to his side, who tried for some moments in
vain to distract his gaze from the object before him.Failing even to
attract notice, she called in her husband and friend, and together they
besought the boy to lie down and go to sleep, but to no avail.Believing
him to be ill and in convulsions, they soon seized him, and were on the
point of immersing him in a hot bath, when, with a sudden spring, he
escaped from their grasp and ran out the front door.Again he fixed his
unwinking eyes upon the moon, and remained speechless for several
seconds.At length, having seemingly satisfied his present curiosity, he
turned on his mother, who stood wringing her hands in the doorway and
moaning piteously, and exclaimed, "I can see the moon yonder, and it is
so beautiful that I am going there to-morrow morning, as soon as I get
up.""So big," he replied, "that I cannot see it all at one glance--as big as
all out of doors.""How far off from you does it seem to be?""About half a car's distance," he quickly rejoined.It may be here remarked that the boy's idea of distance had been
measured all his life by the distance from his home to the street-car
station at the foot of the hill.This was about two hundred yards, so
that the reply indicated that the moon appeared to be only one hundred
yards from the spectator.The boy then proceeded of his own accord to
give a very minute description of the appearance of objects which he
beheld, corresponding, of course, to his poverty of words with which to
clothe his ideas.His account of things beheld by him was so curious, wonderful and
apparently accurate, that the little group about him passed rapidly from
a conviction of his insanity to a belief no less absurd--that he had
become, in the cant lingo of the day, a seeing, or "clairvoyant" medium.Such was the final conclusion to which his parents had arrived at the
time of the visit of the scientific committee.He had been classed with
that credulous school known to this century as spiritualists, and had
been visited solely by persons of that ilk heretofore.The committee having fully examined the boy, and a number of independent
witnesses, as to the facts, soon set about a scientific investigation of
the true causes of of the phenomenon.The first step, of course, was to
examine the lad's eye with the modern ophthalmoscope, an invention of
Professor Helmholtz, of Heidelberg, a few years ago, by means of which
the depths of this organ can be explored, and the smallest variations
from a healthy or normal condition instantaneously detected.The mode of using the instrument is as follows: The room is made
perfectly dark; a brilliant light is then placed near the head of the
patient, and the rays are reflected by a series of small mirrors into
his eye, as if they came from the eye of the observer; then, by looking
through the central aperture of the instrument, the oculist can examine
the illuminated interior of the eyeball, and perceive every detail of
structure, healthy or morbid, as accurately and clearly as we can see
any part of the exterior of the body.No discomfort arises to the organ
examined, and all its hidden mysteries can be studied and understood as
clearly as those of any other organ of the body.This course was taken with John Palmer, and the true secret of his
mysterious power of vision detected in an instant.On applying the ophthalmoscope, the committee ascertained in a moment
that the boy's eye was abnormally shaped.A natural, perfect eye is
perfectly round.But the eye examined was exceedingly flat, very thin,
with large iris, flat lens, immense petira, and wonderfully dilated
pupil.The effect of the shape was at once apparent.It was utterly
impossible to see any object with distinctness at any distance short of
many thousands of miles.Had the eye been elongated inward, or shaped
like an egg--to as great an extent, the boy would have been effectually
blind, for no combination of lens power could have placed the image of
the object beyond the coat of the retina.In other words, there are two
common imperfections of the human organ of sight; one called _myopia_,
or "near-sightedness;" the _presbyopia_, or "far-sightedness.""The axis being too long," says the report, "in myopic eyes, parallel
rays, such as proceed from distant objects, are brought to a focus at a
point so far in front of the retina, that only confused images are
formed upon it.Such a malformation, constituting an excess of
refractive power, can only be neutralized by concave glasses, which give
such a direction to rays entering the eye as will allow of their being
brought to a focus at a proper point for distant perception.""Presbyopia is the reverse of all this.The antero-posterior axis of
such eyes being too short, owing to the flat plate-like shape of the
ball, their refractive power is not sufficient to bring even parallel
rays to a focus upon the retina, but is adapted for convergent rays
only.Convex glasses, in a great measure, compensate for this quality by
rendering parallel rays convergent; and such glasses, in ordinary cases,
bring the rays to a focus at a convenient distance from the glass,
corresponding to its degree of curvature."But in the case under
examination, no glass or combination of glasses could be invented
sufficiently concave to remedy the malformation.By a mathematical
problem of easy solution, it was computed that the nearest distance from
the unaided eye of the patient at which a distinct image could be formed
upon the retina, was two hundred and forty thousand miles, a fraction
short of the mean distance of the moon from the earth; and hence it
became perfectly clear that the boy could see with minute distinctness
whatever was transpiring on the surface of the moon.Such being the undeniable truth as demonstrated by science, the
declaration of the lad assumed a far higher value than the mere dicta of
spiritualists, or the mad ravings of a monomaniac; and the committee at
once set to work to glean all the astronomical knowledge they could by
frequent and prolonged night interviews with the boy.It was on the night of January 9, 1876, that the first satisfactory
experiment was tried, testing beyond all cavil or doubt the powers of
the subject's eye.It was full moon, and that luminary rose clear and
dazzlingly bright.The committee were on hand at an early hour, and the
boy was in fine condition and exuberant spirits.The interview was
secret, and none but the members of the committee and the parents of the
child were present.Of course the first proposition to be settled was
that of the inhabitability of that sphere.This the boy had frequently
declared was the case, and he had on several previous occasions
described minutely the form, size and means of locomotion of the
Lunarians.On this occasion he repeated in almost the same language,
what he had before related to his parents and friends, but was more
minute, owing to the greater transparency of the atmosphere and the
experience in expression already acquired.The Lunarians are not formed at all like ourselves.They are less in
height, and altogether of a different appearance.When fully grown, they
resemble somewhat a chariot wheel, with four spokes, converging at the
center or axle.They have four eyes in the head, which is the axle, so
to speak, and all the limbs branch out directly from the center, like
some sea-forms known as "Radiates."They move by turning rapidly like a
wheel, and travel as fast as a bird through the air.The children are
undeveloped in form, and are perfectly round, like a pumpkin or orange.As they grow older, they seem to drop or absorb the rotundity of the
whole body, and finally assume the appearance of a chariot wheel.They are of different colors, or nationalities--bright red, orange and
blue being the predominant hues.They
do no work, but sleep every four or five hours.They have no houses, and
need none.They have no clothing, and do not require it.There being no
night on the side of the moon fronting the sun, and no day on the
opposite side, all the inhabitants, apparently at a given signal of some
kind, form into vast armies, and flock in myriads to the sleeping
grounds on the shadow-side of the planet.They do not appear to go very
far over the dark rim, for they reappear in immense platoons in a few
hours, and soon spread themselves over the illuminated surface.They
sleep and wake about six times in one ordinary day of twenty-four hours.Their occupations cannot be discerned; they must be totally different
from anything upon the earth.The surface of the moon is all hill and hollow.There are but few level
spots, nor is there any water visible.The atmosphere is almost as
refined and light as hydrogen gas.There is no fire visible, nor are
there any volcanoes.Most of the time of the inhabitants seems to be
spent in playing games of locomotion, spreading themselves into squares,
circles, triangles, and other mathematical figures.No one or two are ever seen separated from the main bodies.The children also flock in herds, and seem to be all of one family.They seem to spawn like herring or shad, or to
be propagated like bees, from the queen, in myriads.The moment after a mathematical figure is formed, it
is dissolved, and fresh combinations take place, like the atoms in a
kaleidoscope.No other species of animal, bird, or being exist upon the
illuminated face of the moon.The shrubbery and vegetation of the moon is all metallic.Vegetable life
nowhere exists; but the forms of some of the shrubs and trees are
exceedingly beautiful.The highest trees do not exceed twenty-five feet,
and they appear to have all acquired their full growth.The ground is
strewn with flowers, but they are all formed of metals--gold, silver,
copper, and tin predominating.But there is a new kind of metal seen
everywhere on tree, shrub and flower, nowhere known on the earth.It is
of a bright vermilion color, and is semi-transparent.The mountains are
all of bare and burnt granite, and appear to have been melted with fire.The committee called the attention of the boy to the bright "sea of
glass" lately observed near the northern rim of the moon, and inquired
of what it is composed.He examined it carefully, and gave such a minute
description of it that it became apparent at once to the committee that
it was pure mercury or quicksilver.The reason why it has but very
recently shown itself to astronomers is thus accounted for: it appears
close up to the line of demarcation separating the light and shadow upon
the moon's disk; and on closer inspection a distinct cataract of the
fluid--in short, a metallic Niagara, was clearly seen falling from the
night side to the day side of the luminary.It has already filled up a
vast plain--one of the four that exist on the moon's surface--and
appears to be still emptying itself with very great rapidity and volume.It covers an area of five by seven hundred miles in extent, and may
possibly deluge one half the entire surface of the moon.It does not
seem to occasion much apprehension to the inhabitants, as they were soon
skating, so to speak, in platoons and battalions, over and across it.In
fact, it presents the appearance of an immense park, to which the
Lunarians flock, and disport themselves with great gusto upon its
polished face.One of the most beautiful sights yet seen by the lad was
the formation of a new figure, which he drew upon the sand with his
finger.The central heart was of crimson-<DW52> natives; the one to the right
of pale orange, and the left of bright blue.It was ten seconds in
forming, and five seconds in dispersing.The number engaged in the
evolution could not be less than half a million.Thus has been solved one of the great astronomical questions of the
century.The next evening the committee assembled earlier, so as to get a view of
the planet Venus before the moon rose.It was the first time that the
lad's attention had been drawn to any of the planets, and he evinced the
liveliest joy when he first beheld the cloudless disk of that
resplendent world.It may here be stated that his power of vision, in
looking at the fixed stars, was no greater or less than that of an
ordinary eye.They appeared only as points of light, too far removed
into the infinite beyond to afford any information concerning their
properties.But the committee were doomed to a greater disappointment
when they inquired of the boy what he beheld on the surface of Venus.He
replied, "Nothing clearly; all is confused and watery; I see nothing
with distinctness."The solution of the difficulty was easily
apprehended, and at once surmised.The focus of the eye was fixed by
nature at 240,000 miles, and the least distance of Venus from the earth
being 24,293,000 miles, it was, of course, impossible to observe that
planet's surface with distinctness.Still she appeared greatly enlarged,
covering about one hundredth part of the heavens, and blazing with
unimaginable splendor.Experiments upon Jupiter and Mars were equally futile, and the committee
half sorrowfully turned again to the inspection of the moon.The report then proceeds at great length to give full descriptions of
the most noted geographical peculiarities of the lunar surface, and
corrects many errors fallen into by Herschel, Leverrier and Proctor.Professor Secchi informs us that the surface of the moon is much better
known to astronomers than the surface of the earth is to geographers;
for there are two zones on the globe within the Arctic and Antarctic
circles, that we can never examine.But every nook and cranny of the
illuminated face of the moon has been fully delineated, examined and
named, so that no object greater than sixty feet square exists but has
been seen and photographed by means of Lord Rosse's telescope and De la
Ruis' camera and apparatus.As the entire report will be ordered
published at the next weekly meeting of the College, we refrain from
further extracts, but now proceed to narrate the results of our own
interviews with the boy.It was on the evening of the 17th of February, 1876, that we ventured
with rather a misgiving heart to approach Culp Hill, and the humble
residence of a child destined, before the year is out, to become the
most celebrated of living beings.We armed ourselves with a pound of
sugar candy for the boy, some _muslin-de-laine_ as a present to the
mother, and a box of cigars for the father.We also took with us a very
large-sized opera-glass, furnished for the purpose by M. Muller.At
first we encountered a positive refusal; then, on exhibiting the cigars,
a qualified negative; and finally, when the muslin and candy were drawn
on the enemy, we were somewhat coldly invited in and proffered a seat.The boy was pale and restless, and his eyes without bandage or glasses.We soon ingratiated ourself into the good opinion of the whole party,
and henceforth encountered no difficulty in pursuing our investigations.The moon being nearly full, we first of all verified the tests by the
committee.Requesting, then, to stay until after midnight, for the purpose of
inspecting Mars with the opera-glass, we spent the interval in obtaining
the history of the child, which we have given above.The planet Mars being at this time almost in dead opposition to the sun,
and with the earth in conjunction, is of course as near to the earth as
he ever approaches, the distance being thirty-five millions of miles.He
rises toward midnight, and is in the constellation Virgo, where he may
be seen to the greatest possible advantage, being in perigee.Mars is
most like the earth of all the planetary bodies.He revolves on his axis
in a little over twenty-four hours, and his surface is pleasantly
variegated with land and water, pretty much like our own world--the
land, however, being in slight excess.He is, therefore, the most
interesting of all the heavenly bodies to the inhabitants of the earth.Having all things in readiness, we directed the glass to the planet.Alas, for all our calculations, the power was insufficient to clear away
the obscurity resulting from imperfect vision and short focus.Swallowing the bitter disappointment, we hastily made arrangements for
another interview, with a telescope, and bade the family good night.There is but one large telescope properly mounted in the city, and that
is the property and pride of its accomplished owner, J. P. Manrow, Esq.We at once procured an interview with that gentleman, and it was agreed
that on Saturday evening the boy should be conveyed to his residence,
picturesquely situated on Russian Hill, commanding a magnificent view of
the Golden Gate and the ocean beyond.At the appointed hour the boy, his parents and myself presented
ourselves at the door of that hospitable mansion.We were cordially
welcomed, and conducted without further parley into the lofty
observatory on the top of the house.In due time the magnificent tube
was presented at the planet, but it was discovered that the power it was
set for was too low.It was then gauged for 240,000 diameters, being the
full strength of the telescope, and the eye of the boy observer placed
at the eye-glass.One cry of joy, and unalloyed delight told the story!Mars, and its mountains and seas, its rivers, vales, and estuaries, its
polar snow-caps and grassy plains--its inhabitants, palaces, ships,
villages and cities, were all revealed, as distinctly, clearly and
certainly, as the eye of Kit Carson, from the summits of the Sierra
Nevada range, beheld the stupendous panorama of the Sacramento Valley,
and the snow-clad summits of Mount Hood and Shasta Butte.[Decoration]

XII._THE EMERALD ISLE._


    Chaos was ended.From its ruins rolled
    The central Sun, poised on his throne of gold;
    The changeful Moon, that floods the hollow dome
    Of raven midnight with her silvery foam;
    Vast constellations swarming all around,
    In seas of azure, without line or bound,
    And this green globe, rock-ribbed and mountain-crown'd.The eye of God, before His hand had made
    Man in His image, this wide realm surveyed;
    O'er hill and valley, over stream and wood,
    He glanced triumphant, and pronounced it "good."But ere He formed old Adam and his bride,
    He called a shining seraph to His side,
    And pointing to our world, that gleamed afar,
    And twinkled on creation's verge, a star,
    Bade him float 'round this new and narrow span
    And bring report if all were ripe for Man.The angel spread his fluttering pinions fair,
    And circled thrice the circumambient air;
    Quick, then, as thought, he stood before the gate
    Where cherubs burn, and minist'ring spirits wait.Nor long he stood, for God beheld his plume,
    Already tarnished by terrestrial gloom,
    And beck'ning kindly to the flurried aid,
    Said, "Speak your wish; if good, be it obeyed."The seraph raised his gem-encircled hand,
    Obeisance made, at heaven's august command,
    And thus replied, in tones so bold and clear,
    That angels turned and lent a listening ear:
    "Lord of all systems, be they near or far,
    Thrice have I circled 'round yon beauteous Star,
    I've seen its mountains rise, its rivers roll,
    Its oceans sweep majestic to each pole;
    Its floors in mighty continents expand,
    Or dwindle into specs of fairy-land;
    Its prairies spread, its forests stretch in pride,
    And all its valleys dazzle like a bride;
    Hymns have I heard in all its winds and streams,
    And beauty seen in all its rainbow gleams.But whilst the LAND can boast of every gem
    That sparkles in each seraph's diadem;
    Whilst diamonds blaze 'neath dusk Golconda's skies,
    And rubies bleed where Alps and Andes rise;
    Whilst in Brazilian brooks the topaz shines,
    And opals burn in California mines;
    Whilst in the vales of Araby the Blest
    The sapphire flames beside the amethyst:
    The pauper Ocean sobs forever more,
    Ungemm'd, unjeweled, on its wailing shore!""Add music to the song the breakers sing!"The strong-soul'd seraph cried, "I'd make yon sea
    Rival in tone heaven's sweetest minstrelsy;
    I'd plant within the ocean's bubbling tide
    An island gem, of every sea the pride!So bright in robes of ever-living green,
    In breath so sweet, in features so serene,
    Such crystal streams to course its valleys fair,
    Such healthful gales to purify its air,
    Such fertile soil, such ever-verdant trees,
    Angels should name it 'EMERALD OF THE SEAS!'"The seraph paused, and downward cast his eyes,
    Whilst heav'nly hosts stood throbbing with surprise.Again the Lord of all the realms above,
    Supreme in might, but infinite in love,
    With no harsh accent in His tones replied:
    "Go, drop this Emerald in the envious tide!"Quick as the lightning cleaves the concave blue,
    The seraph seized the proffer'd gem, and flew
    Until he reached the confines of the earth,
    Still struggling in the throes of turbid birth;
    And there, upon his self-sustaining wing,
    Sat poised, and heard our globe her matins sing;
    Beheld the sun traverse the arching sky,
    The sister Moon walk forth in majesty;
    Saw every constellation rise and roll
    Athwart the heaven, or circle round the pole.Nor did he move, until our spotted globe
    Had donned for him her morn and evening robe;
    Till on each land his critic eye was cast,
    And every ocean rose, and heav'd, and pass'd;
    Then, like some eagle pouncing on its prey,
    He downward sail'd, through bellowing clouds and spray,
    To where he saw the billows bounding free,
    And dropped the gem within the stormy sea!And would'st thou know, Chief of St.Patrick's band,
    Where fell this jewel from the seraph's hand?What ocean caught the world-enriching prize?Child of Moina, homeward cast your eyes!in the midst of wat'ry deserts wide,
    Behold the EMERALD bursting through the tide,
    And bearing on its ever vernal-sod
    The monogram of seraph, and of God!Its name, the sweetest human lips e'er sung,
    First trembled on an angel's fervid tongue;
    Then chimed AEolian on the evening air,
    Lisped by an infant, in its mother prayer;
    Next roared in war, with battle's flag unfurl'd;
    Now, gemm'd with glory, gather'd through the world!Perfidious Albion, blush with shame:
    It is thy sister's!Once more the seraph stood before the throne
    Of dread Omnipotence, pensive and alone."I dropped the jewel in the flashing tide,"
    The seraph said; but saw with vision keen
    A mightier angel stalk upon the scene,
    Whose voice like grating thunder smote his ear
    And taught his soul the mystery of fear."Because thy heart with impious pride did swell,
    And dared make better what thy God made well;
    Because thy hand did fling profanely down
    On Earth a jewel wrenched from Heaven's bright crown,
    The Isle which thine own fingers did create
    Shall reap a blessing and a curse from fate!"Far in the future, as the years roll on,
    And all the pagan ages shall have flown;
    When Christian virtues, flaming into light,
    Shall save the world from superstition's night;
    Erin, oppress'd, shall bite the tyrant's heel,
    And for a thousand years enslaved shall kneel;
    Her sons shall perish in the field and flood,
    Her daughters starve in city, wold, and wood;
    Her patriots, with their blood, the block shall stain,
    Her matrons fly behind the Western main;
    Harpies from Albion shall her strength consume,
    And thorns and thistles in her gardens bloom.But, curse of curses thine, O!fated land:
    Traitors shall thrive where statesmen ought to stand!But past her heritage of woe and pain,
    A far more blest millennium shall reign;
    Seedlings of heroes shall her exiles be,
    Where'er they find a home beyond the sea;
    Bright paragons of beauty and of truth,
    Her maidens all shall dazzle in their youth;
    And when age comes, to dim the flashing eye,
    Still gems of virtue shall they live, and die!No braver race shall breathe beneath the sun
    Than thine, O!Erin, ere the goal be won.Wherever man shall battle for the right,
    There shall thy sons fall thickest in the fight;
    Wherever man shall perish to be free,
    There shall thy martyrs foremost be!when thy redemption is at hand,
    Soldiers shall swell thy ranks from every land!Heroes shall flock in thousands to thy shore,
    And swear thy soil is FREE FOREVERMORE!Then shall thy harp be from the willow torn,
    And in yon glitt'ring galaxy be borne!Then shall the Emerald change its verdant crest,
    And blaze a Star co-equal with the rest!The sentence pass'd, the doomsman felt surprise,
    For tears were streaming from the seraph's eyes."Weep not for Erin," once again he spoke,
    "But for thyself, that did'st her doom provoke;
    I bear a message, seraph, unto thee,
    As unrelenting in its stern decree.For endless years it is thy fate to stand,
    The chosen guardian of the SHAMROCK land.Three times, as ages wind their coils away,
    Incarnate on yon Island shalt thou stray."First as a Saint, in majesty divine,
    The world shall know thee by this potent sign:
    From yonder soil, where pois'nous reptiles dwell,
    Thy voice shall snake and slimy toad expel.Next as a Martyr, pleading in her cause,
    Thy blood shall flow to build up Albion's laws.Last as a Prophet and a Bard combined,
    Rebellion's fires shall mould thy patriot mind.In that great day, when Briton's strength shall fail,
    And all her glories shiver on the gale;
    When winged chariots, rushing through the sky,
    Shall drop their <DW19>s, blazing as they fly,
    Thy form shall tower, a hero'midst the flames,
    And add one more to Erin's deathless names!"gathered here in state,
    Such is the story of your country's fate.Six thousand years in strife have rolled away,
    Since Erin sprang from billowy surf and spray;
    In that drear lapse, her sons have never known
    One ray of peace to gild her crimson zone.Cast back your glance athwart the tide of years,
    Behold each billow steeped with Erin's tears,
    Inspect each drop that swells the mighty flood,
    Its purple globules smoke with human blood!Come with me now, and trace the seraph's path,
    That has been trodden since his day of wrath.in the year when Attila the Hun
    Had half the world in terror overrun,
    On Erin's shore there stood a noble youth,
    The breath of honor and the torch of truth.His was the tongue that taught the Celtic soul
    Christ was its Saviour, Heaven was its goal!His was the hand that drove subdued away,
    The venom horde that lured but to betray;
    His were the feet that sanctified the sod,
    Erin redeemed, and gave her back to God!The gray old Earth can boost no purer fame
    Than that whose halos gild ST.Twelve times the centuries builded up their store
    Of plots, rebellions, gibbets, tears and gore;
    Twelve times centennial annivers'ries came,
    To bless the seraph in St.In that long night of treach'ry and gloom,
    How many myriads found a martyr's tomb!Beside the waters of the dashing Rhone
    In exile starved the bold and blind TYRONE.Beneath the glamour of the tyrant's steel
    Went out in gloom the soul of great O'NEILL.What countless thousands, children of her loin,
    Sank unanneal'd beneath the bitter Boyne!What fathers fell, what mothers sued in vain,
    In Tredah's walls, on Wexford's gory plain,
    When Cromwell's shaven panders slaked their lust,
    And Ireton's fiends despoiled the breathless dust!Still came no seraph, incarnate in man,
    To rescue Erin from the bandit clan.Still sad and lone, she languished in her chains,
    That clank'd in chorus o'er her martyrs' manes.At length, when Freedom's struggle was begun
    Across the seas, by conq'ring Washington,
    When CURRAN thunder'd, and when GRATTAN spoke,
    The guardian seraph from his slumber woke.Then guilty Norbury from his vengeance fled,
    FITZGERALD fought, and glorious WOLFE TONE bled.Then EMMET rose, to start the battle-cry,
    To strike, to plead, to threaten, and to die!happier in thy doom,
    Though uninscrib'd remains thy seraph tomb,
    Than the long line of Erin's scepter'd foes,
    Whose bones in proud mausoleums repose;
    More noble blood through Emmet's pulses rings
    Than courses through ten thousand hearts of kings!Thus has the seraph twice redeem'd his fate,
    And roamed a mortal through this low estate;
    Again obedient to divine command,
    His final incarnation is at hand.Scarce shall yon sun _five times_ renew the year,
    Ere Erin's guardian Angel shall appear,
    Not as a priest, in holy garb arrayed;
    Not as a patriot, by his cause betray'd,
    Shall he again assume a mortal guise,
    And tread the earth, an exile from the skies.But like the lightning from the welkin hurl'd,
    His eye shall light, his step shall shake the world!Are ye but scions of degenerate slaves?Shall tyrants spit upon your fathers' graves?Is all the life-blood stagnant in your veins?Love ye no music but the clank of chains?Hear ye no voices ringing in the air,
    That chant in chorus wild, _Prepare_, PREPARE!on the winds there comes a prophet sound,--
    The blood of Abel crying from the ground,--
    Pealing in tones of thunder through the world,
    "ARM!On some bold headland do I seem to stand,
    And watch the billows breaking 'gainst the land;
    Not in lone rollers do their waters poor,
    But the vast ocean rushes to the shore.So flock in millions sons of honest toil,
    From ev'ry country, to their native soil;
    Exiles of Erin, driven from her sod,
    By foes of justice, mercy, man, and God!AErial chariots spread their snowy wings,
    And drop torpedoes in the halls of kings.On every breeze a thousand banners fly,
    And Erin's seraph swells the battle-cry:--
    "Strike!till proud Albion bows her haughty head!for the bones that fill your mothers' graves!till fair Freedom on the world shall smile![Decoration]

XIII._THE EARTH'S HOT CENTER._


The following extracts from the report of the Hon.John Flannagan,
United States Consul at Bruges, in Belgium, to the Secretary of State,
published in the Washington City _Telegraph_ of a late date, will fully
explain what is meant by the "Great Scare in Belgium."Our extracts are not taken continuously, as the entire document would be
too voluminous for our pages.But where breaks appear we have indicated
the hiatus in the usual manner by asterisks, or by brief explanations.BRUGES, December 12, 1872.HAMILTON FISH,
                     Secretary of State.SIR: In pursuance of special instructions recently received from
   Washington (containing inclosures from Prof.Henry of the
   Smithsonian Institute, and Prof.Lovering of Harvard), I
   proceeded on Wednesday last to the scene of operations at the
   "International Exploring Works," and beg leave to submit the
   following circumstantial report:

   Before proceeding to detail the actual state of affairs at
   Dudzeele, near the line of canal connecting Bruges with the North
   Sea, it may not be out of place to furnish a succinct history of
   the origin of the explorations out of which the present alarming
   events have arisen.It will be remembered by the State Department
   that during the short interregnum of the provisional government
   of France, under Lamartine and Cavaignac, in 1848, a proposition
   was submitted by France to the governments of the United States,
   Great Britain and Russia, and which was subsequently extended to
   King Leopold of Belgium, to create an "International Board for
   Subterranean Exploration" in furtherance of science, and in
   order, primarily, to test the truth of the theory of igneous
   central fusion, first propounded by Leibnitz, and afterward
   embraced by most of contemporary geologists; but also with the
   further objects of ascertaining the magnetic condition of the
   earth's crust, the variations of the needle at great depths, and
   finally to set at rest the doubts of some of the English
   mineralogists concerning the permanency of the coal measures,
   about which considerable alarm had been felt in all the
   manufacturing centers of Europe.The protocol of a quintuple treaty was finally drawn by Prof.Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, and approved by Sir Roderick
   Murchison, at that time President of the Royal Society of Great
   Britain.To this project Arago lent the weight of his great name,
   and Nesselrode affixed the approval of Russia, it being one of
   the last official acts performed by that veteran statesman.The programme called for annual appropriations by each of the
   above-named powers of 100,000 francs (about $20,000 each), the
   appointment of commissioners and a general superintendent, the
   selection of a site for prosecuting the undertaking, and a board
   of scientific visitors, consisting of one member from each
   country.It is unnecessary to detail the proceedings for the first few
   months after the organization of the commission.Watson, of
   Chicago, the author of a scientific treatise called "Prairie
   Geology," was selected by President Fillmore, as the first
   representative of the United States; Russia sent Olgokoff;
   France, Ango Jeuno; England, Sir Edward Sabine, the present
   President of the Royal Society; and Belgium, Dr.Secchi, since so
   famous for his spectroscopic observations on the fixed stars.These gentlemen, after organizing at Paris, spent almost an
   entire year in traveling before a site for the scene of
   operations was selected.Finally, on the 10th of April, 1849, the
   first ground was broken for actual work at Dudzeele, in the
   neighborhood of Bruges, in the Kingdom of Belgium.The considerations which led to the choice of this locality were
   the following: First, it was the most central, regarding the
   capitals of the parties to the protocol; secondly, it was easy of
   access and connected by rail with Brussels, Paris and St.Petersburg, and by line of steamers with London, being situated
   within a short distance of the mouth of the Hond or west Scheldt;
   thirdly, and perhaps as the most important consideration of all,
   it was the seat of the deepest shaft in the world, namely, the
   old salt mine at Dudzeele, which had been worked from the time of
   the Romans down to the commencement of the present century, at
   which time it was abandoned, principally on account of the
   intense heat at the bottom of the excavation, and which could not
   be entirely overcome except by the most costly scientific
   appliances.There was still another reason, which, in the estimation of at
   least one member of the commission, Prof.Watson, overrode them
   all--the exceptional increase of heat with depth, which was its
   main characteristic.The scientific facts upon which this great work was projected,
   may be stated as follows: It is the opinion of the principal
   modern geologists, based primarily upon the hypothesis of Kant
   (that the solar universe was originally an immense mass of
   incandescent vapor gradually cooled and hardened after being
   thrown off from the grand central body--afterward elaborated by
   La Place into the present nebular hypothesis)--that "the globe
   was once in a state of igneous fusion, and that as its heated
   mass began to cool, an exterior crust was formed, first very
   thin, and afterward gradually increasing until it attained its
   present thickness, which has been variously estimated at from ten
   to two hundred miles.During the process of gradual
   refrigeration, some portions of the crust cooled more rapidly
   than others, and the pressure on the interior igneous mass being
   unequal, the heated matter or lava burst through the thinner
   parts, and caused high-peaked mountains; the same cause also
   producing all volcanic action."The arguments in favor of this
   doctrine are almost innumerable; these are among the most
   prominent:

   _First._ The form of the earth is just that which an igneous
   liquid mass would assume if thrown into an orbit with an axial
   revolution similar to that of our earth.Not many years ago
   Professor Faraday, assisted by Wheatstone, devised a most
   ingenious apparatus by which, in the laboratory of the Royal
   Society, he actually was enabled, by injecting a flame into a
   vacuum, to exhibit visibly all the phenomena of the formation of
   the solar universe, as contended for by La Place and by Humboldt
   in his "Cosmos."_Secondly._ It is perfectly well ascertained that heat increases
   with depth, in all subterranean excavations.This is the
   invariable rule in mining shafts, and preventive measures must
   always be devised and used, by means generally of air apparatus,
   to temper the heat as the depth is augmented, else deep mining
   would have to be abandoned.The rate of increase has been
   variously estimated by different scientists in widely distant
   portions of the globe.A few of them may be mentioned at this
   place, since it was upon a total miscalculation on this head that
   led to the present most deplorable results.The editor of the _Journal of Science_, in April, 1832,
   calculated from results obtained in six of the deepest coal mines
   in Durham and Northumberland, the mean rate of increase at one
   degree of Fahrenheit for a descent of forty-four English feet.In this instance it is noticeable that the bulb of the
   thermometer was introduced into cavities purposely cut into the
   solid rock, at depths varying from two hundred to nine hundred
   feet.The Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, as examined by Mr.Fox, at
   the depth of thirteen hundred and eighty feet, gave on average
   result of four degrees for every seventy-five feet.Kupffer compared results obtained from the silver mines in
   Mexico, Peru and Freiburg, from the salt wells of Saxony, and
   from the copper mines in the Caucasus, together with an
   examination of the tin mines of Cornwall and the coal mines in
   the north of England, and found the average to be at least one
   degree of Fahrenheit for every thirty-seven English feet.Cordier, on the contrary, considers this amount somewhat
   overstated and reduces the general average to one degree
   Centigrade for every twenty-five metres, or about one degree of
   Fahrenheit for every forty-five feet English measure._Thirdly._ That the lavas taken from all parts of the world, when
   subjected to chemical analysis, indicate that they all proceed
   from a common source; and

   _Fourthly._ On no other hypothesis can we account for the change
   of climate indicated by fossils.The rate of increase of heat in the Dudzeele shaft was no less
   than one degree Fahrenheit for every thirty feet English measure.At the time of recommencing sinking in the shaft on the 10th of
   April, 1849, the perpendicular depth was twenty-three hundred and
   seventy feet, the thermometer marking forty-eight degrees
   Fahrenheit at the surface; this would give the enormous heat of
   one hundred and twenty-seven degrees Fahrenheit at the bottom of
   the mine.Of course, without ventilation no human being could
   long survive in such an atmosphere, and the first operations of
   the commission were directed to remedy this inconvenience.The report then proceeds to give the details of a very successful
contrivance for forcing air into the shaft at the greatest depths, only
a portion of which do we deem it important to quote, as follows:

   The width of the Moer-Vater, or Lieve, at this point, was ten
   hundred and eighty yards, and spanned by an old bridge, the stone
   piers of which were very near together, having been built by the
   emperor Hadrian in the early part of the second century.The rise
   of the tide in the North Sea, close at hand, was from fifteen to
   eighteen feet, thus producing a current almost as rapid as that
   of the Mersey at Liverpool.The commissioners determined to
   utilize this force, in preference to the erection of expensive
   steam works at the mouth of the mine.A plan was submitted by
   Cyrus W. Field, and at once adopted.Turbine wheels were built,
   covering the space betwixt each arch, movable, and adapted to the
   rise and fall of the tide.Gates were also constructed between
   each arch, and a head of water, ranging from ten to fifteen feet
   fall, provided for each turn of the tide--both in the ebb and the
   flow, so that there should be a continuous motion to the
   machinery.Near the mouth of the shaft two large boiler-iron
   reservoirs were constructed, capable of holding from one hundred
   and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand cubic feet of
   compressed air, the average rate of condensation being about two
   hundred atmospheres.These reservoirs were properly connected
   with the pumping apparatus of the bridge by large cast-iron
   mains, so that the supply was continuous, and at an almost
   nominal cost.It was by the same power of compressed air that the
   tunneling through Mount St.Gothard was effected for the Lyons
   and Turin Railway, just completed.The first operations were to enlarge the shaft so as to form an
   opening forty by one hundred feet, English measure.This consumed
   the greater part of the year 1849, so that the real work of
   sinking was not fairly under way until early in 1850.But from
   that period down to the memorable 5th of November, 1872, the
   excavation steadily progressed.I neglected to state at the
   outset that M. Jean Dusoloy, the state engineer of Belgium, was
   appointed General Superintendent, and continued to fill that
   important office until he lost his life, on the morning of the
   6th of November, the melancholly details of which are hereinafter
   fully narrated.As the deepening progressed the heat of the bottom continued to
   increase, but it was soon observed in a different ratio from the
   calculations of the experts.After attaining the depth of fifteen
   thousand six hundred and fifty feet,--about the height of Mt.Blanc--which was reached early in 1864, it was noticed, for the
   first time, that the laws of temperature and gravitation were
   synchronous; that is, that the heat augmented in a ratio
   proportioned to the square of the distance from the surface
   downward.Hence the increase at great depths bore no relation at
   all to the apparently gradual augmentation near the surface.As
   early as June, 1868, it became apparent that the sinking, if
   carried on at all, would have to be protected by some
   atheromatous or adiathermic covering.Professor Tyndall was
   applied to, and, at the request of Lord Palmerston, made a vast
   number of experiments on non-conducting bodies.As the result of
   his labors, he prepared a compound solution about the density of
   common white lead, composed of selenite alum and sulphate of
   copper, which was laid on three or four thicknesses, first upon
   the bodies of the naked miners--for in all deep mines the
   operatives work _in puris naturalibus_--and then upon an
   oval-shaped cage made of papier mache, with a false bottom,
   enclosed within which the miners were enabled to endure the
   intense heat for a shift of two hours each day.The drilling was
   all done by means of the diamond-pointed instrument, and the
   blasting by nitro-glycerine from the outset; so that the
   principal labor consisted in shoveling up the debris and keeping
   the drill-point _in situ_.Before proceeding further it may not be improper to enumerate a
   few of the more important scientific facts which, up to the 1st
   of November of the past year, had been satisfactorily
   established.First in importance is the one alluded to above--the
   rate of increase of temperature as we descend into the bowels of
   the earth.This law, shown above to correspond exactly with the
   law of attraction or gravitation, had been entirely overlooked by
   all the scientists, living or dead.No one had for a moment
   suspected that heat followed the universal law of physics as a
   material body ought to do, simply because, from the time of De
   Saussure, heat had been regarded only as a force or _vis viva_
   and not as a ponderable quality.But not only was heat found to be subject to the law of inverse
   ratio of the square of the distance from the surface, but the
   atmosphere itself followed the same invariable rule.Thus, while
   we know that water boils at the level of the sea at two hundred
   and twelve degrees Fahrenheit, it readily vaporizes at one
   hundred and eighty-five degrees on the peak of Teneriffe, only
   fifteen thousand feet above that level.This, we know, is owing
   to the weight of the superincumbent atmosphere, there being a
   heavier burden at the surface than at any height above it.The
   rate of decrease above the surface is perfectly regular, being
   one degree for every five hundred and ninety feet of ascent.But
   the amazing fact was shown that the weight of the atmosphere
   increased in a ratio proportioned to the square of the distance
   downward.... The magnetic needle also evinced some curious
   disturbance, the dip being invariably upward.Its action also was
   exceedingly feeble, and the day before the operations ceased it
   lost all polarity whatever, and the finest magnet would not
   meander from the point of the compass it happened to be left at
   for the time being.As Sir Edward Sabine finely said, "The hands
   of the magnetic clock stopped."But the activity of the needle
   gradually increased as the surface was approached.All electrical action also ceased, which fully confirms the
   theory, of Professor Faraday, that "electricity is a force
   generated by the rapid axial revolution of the earth, and that
   magnetic attraction in all cases points or operates at right
   angles to its current."Hence electricity, from the nature of its
   cause, must be superficial.Every appearance of water disappeared at the depth of only 9000
   feet.From this depth downward the rock was of a basaltic
   character, having not the slightest appearance of granite
   formation--confirming, in a most remarkable manner, the discovery
   made only last year, that all _granites_ are of _aqueous_,
   instead of _igneous_ deposition.As a corollary from the law of
   atmospheric pressure, it was found utterly impossible to vaporize
   water at a greater depth than 24,000 feet, which point was
   reached in 1869.No amount of heat affected it in the least
   perceptible manner, and on weighing the liquid at the greatest
   depth attained, by means of a nicely adjusted scale, it was found
   to be of a density expressed thus: 198,073, being two degrees or
   integers of atomic weight heavier than gold, at the surface.The report then proceeds to discuss the question of the true figure of
the earth, whether an oblate spheroid, as generally supposed, or only
truncated at the poles; the length of a degree of longitude at the
latitude of Dudzeele, 51 deg.The concluding portion of the report is reproduced in full.For the past twelve months it was found impossible to endure the
   heat, even sheltered as the miners were by the atmospheric cover
   and cage, for more than fifteen minutes at a time, so that the
   expense of sinking had increased geometrically for the past two
   years.However, important results had been obtained, and a
   perpendicular depth reached many thousands of feet below the
   deepest sea soundings of Lieutenant Brooks.In fact, the enormous
   excavation, on the 1st of November, 1872, measured
   perpendicularly, no less than 37,810 feet and 6 inches from the
   floor of the shaft building!The highest peak of the Himalayas is
   only little over 28,000 feet, so that it can at once be seen that
   no time had been thrown away by the Commissioners since the
   inception of the undertaking, in April, 1849.The first symptoms of alarm were felt on the evening of November
   1.The men complained of a vast increase of heat, and the cages
   had to be dropped every five minutes for the greater part of the
   night; and of those who attempted to work, at least one half were
   extricated in a condition of fainting, but one degree from
   cyncope.Toward morning, hoarse, profound and frequent
   subterranean explosions were heard, which had increased at noon
   to one dull, threatening and continuous roar.But the miners went
   down bravely to their tasks, and resolved to work as long as
   human endurance could bear it.But this was not to be much
   longer; for late at night, on the 4th, after hearing a terrible
   explosion, which shook the whole neighborhood, a hot sirocco
   issued from the bottom, which drove them all out in a state of
   asphyxia.The heat at the surface became absolutely unendurable,
   and on sending down a cage with only a dog in it, the materials
   of which it was composed took fire, and the animal perished in
   the flames.At 3 o'clock A. M. the iron fastenings to another
   cage were found fused, and the wire ropes were melted for more
   than 1000 feet at the other end.The detonations became more
   frequent, the trembling of the earth at the surface more violent,
   and the heat more oppressive around the mouth of the orifice.A
   few minutes before 4 o'clock a subterranean crash was heard,
   louder than Alpine thunder, and immediately afterward a furious
   cloud of ashes, smoke and gaseous exhalation shot high up into
   the still darkened atmosphere of night.At this time at least one
   thousand of the terrified and half-naked inhabitants of the
   neighboring village of Dudzeele had collected on the spot, and
   with wringing hands and fearful outcries bewailed their fate, and
   threatened instant death to the officers of the commission, and
   even to the now terrified miners.Finally, just before dawn, on
   the 5th of November, or, to be more precise, at exactly twenty
   minutes past 6 A. M., molten lava made its appearance at the
   surface!The fright now became general, and as the burning buildings shed
   their ominous glare around, and the languid stream of liquid fire
   slowly bubbled up and rolled toward the canal, the scene assumed
   an aspect of awful sublimity and grandeur.The plains around were
   lit up for many leagues, and the foggy skies intensified and
   reduplicated the effects of the illumination.Toward sunrise the
   flow of lava was suspended for nearly an hour, but shortly after
   ten o'clock it suddenly increased its volume, and, as it cooled,
   formed a sort of saucer-shaped funnel, over the edges of which it
   boiled up, broke, and ran off in every direction.It was at this
   period that the accomplished Dusoloy, so long the Superintendent,
   lost his life.As the lava slowly meandered along, he attempted
   to cross the stream by stepping from one mass of surface cinders
   to another.Making a false step, the floating rock upon which he
   sprang suddenly turned over, and before relief could be afforded
   his body was consumed to a crisp.I regret to add that his fate
   kindled no sympathy among the assembled multitude; but they
   rudely seized his mutilated remains, and amid jeers, execrations,
   and shouts of triumph, attached a large stone to the
   half-consumed corpse and precipitated it into the canal.Thus are
   the heroes of science frequently sacrificed to the fury of a
   plebeian mob.It would afford me a pleasure to inform the department that the
   unforeseen evils of our scientific convention terminated here.But I regret to add that such is very far from being the case.Indeed, from the appearance of affairs this morning at the
   volcanic crater--for such it has now become--the possible evils
   are almost incalculable.The Belgian Government was duly notified
   by telegraph of the death of the Superintendent and the mutinous
   disposition of the common people about Bruges, and early on the
   morning of the 6th of November a squad of flying horse was
   dispatched to the spot to maintain order.But this interference
   only made matters worse.The discontent, augmented by the wildest
   panic, became universal, and the mob reigned supreme.Nor could
   the poor wretches be greatly condemned; for toward evening the
   lava current reached the confines of the old village of Dudzeele,
   and about midnight set the town on fire.The lurid glare of the
   conflagration awakened the old burghers of Bruges from their
   slumbers and spread consternation in the city, though distant
   several miles from the spot.A meeting was called at the
   Guildhall at dawn, and the wildest excitement prevailed.But
   after hearing explanations from the members of the commission,
   the populace quietly but doggedly dispersed.The government from
   this time forward did all that power and prudence combined could
   effect to quell the reign of terror around Bruges.In this
   country the telegraph, being a government monopoly, has been
   rigorously watched and a cordon of military posts established
   around the threatened district, so that it has been almost
   impossible to convey intelligence of this disaster beyond the
   limits of the danger.In the mean time, a congress of the most
   experienced scientists was invited to the scene for the purpose
   of suggesting some remedy against the prospective spread of the
   devastation.The first meeting took place at the old Guildhall in
   Bruges and was strictly private, none being admitted except the
   diplomatic representatives of foreign governments, and the
   members elect of the college.As in duty bound, I felt called on
   to attend, and shall in this place attempt a short synopsis of
   the proceedings.Professor Palmieri, of Naples, presided, and Dr.Kirchoff
   officiated as secretary.Gassiot, of Paris, was the first speaker, and contended that the
   theory of nucleatic fusion, now being fully established it only
   remained to prescribe the laws governing its superficial action."There is but one law applicable, that I am aware of," said he,
   "and that is the law which drives from the center of a revolving
   body all fluid matter toward the circumference, and forcibly
   ejects it into space, if possible, in the same manner that a
   common grindstone in rapid motion will drive off from its rim
   drops of water or other foreign unattached matter.Thus, whenever
   we find a vent or open orifice, as in the craters of active
   volcanoes, the incandescent lava boils up and frequently
   overflows the top of the highest peak of the Andes."Palmieri then asked the speaker "if he wished to be understood as
   expressing the unqualified opinion that an orifice once being
   opened would continue to flow forever, and that there was no law
   governing the quantity or regulating the level to which it could
   rise?"The Neapolitan philosopher then added: "I dissent _in toto_ from
   the opinion of M. Gassiot.For more than a quarter of a century I
   have studied the lava-flows of Vesuvius, AEtna and Stromboli, and
   I can assure the Congress that the Creator has left no such flaw
   in His mechanism of the globe.The truth is, that molten lava can
   only rise about 21,000 feet above the level of the sea, owing to
   the balance-wheel of terrestrial gravitation, which counteracts
   at that height all centrifugal energy.Were this not so, the
   entire contents of the globe would gush from the incandescent
   center and fly off into surrounding space."M. Gassiot replied, "that true volcanoes were supplied by nature
   with _circumvalvular lips_, and hence, after filling their
   craters, they ceased to flow.But in the instance before us no
   such provision existed, and the only protection which he could
   conceive of consisted in the smallness of the orifice; and he
   would therefore recommend his Majesty King Leopold to direct all
   his efforts to confine the aperture to its present size."Palmieri again responded, "that he had no doubt but that the
   crater at Dudzeele would continue to flow until it had built up
   around itself basaltic walls to the height of many hundreds,
   perhaps thousands, of feet, and that the idea of setting bounds
   to the size of the mouth of the excavation was simply
   ridiculous."Gassiot interrupted, and was about to answer in a very excited
   tone, when Prof.Palmieri "disclaimed any intention of personal
   insult, but spoke from a scientific standpoint."He then
   proceeded: "The lava bed of Mount AEtna maintains a normal level
   of 7000 feet, while Vesuvius calmly reposes at a little more than
   one half that altitude.Whitney, of the Pacific Survey, Mount Kilauea, in the Sandwich
   Islands, bubbles up to the enormous height of 17,000 feet.It
   cannot be contended that the crater of Vesuvius is not a true
   nucleatic orifice, because I have demonstrated that the molten
   bed regularly rises and falls like the tides of the ocean when
   controlled by the moon."It was seen at once that the scientists
   present were totally unprepared to discuss the question in its
   novel and most important aspects; and on taking a vote, at the
   close of the session, the members were equally divided between
   the opinions of Gassiot and Palmieri.A further session will take
   place on the arrival of Prof.Tyndall, who has been telegraphed
   for from New York, and of the great Russian geologist and
   astronomer, Tugenieff.In conclusion, the damage already done may be summed up as
   follows: The destruction of the Bruges and Hond Canal by the
   formation of a basaltic <DW18> across it more than two hundred feet
   wide, the burning of Dudzeele, and the devastation of about
   thirty thousand acres of valuable land.At the same time it is
   utterly impossible to predict where the damage may stop, inasmuch
   as early this morning the mouth of the crater had fallen in, and
   the flowing stream had more than doubled in size.In consideration of the part hitherto taken by the Government of
   the United States in originating the work that led to the
   catastrophe, and by request of M. Musenheim, the Belgian Foreign
   Secretary, I have taken the liberty of drawing upon the State
   Department for eighty-seven thousand dollars, being the sum
   agreed to be paid for the cost of emigration to the United States
   of two hundred families (our own pro rata) rendered homeless by
   the conflagration of Dudzeele.I am this moment in receipt of your telegram dated yesterday,
   and rejoice to learn that Prof.Agassiz has returned from the
   South Seas, and will be sent forward without delay.With great respect, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,

                                        JOHN FLANNAGAN,
                                United States Consul at Bruges.P.S.--Since concluding the above dispatch, Professor Palmieri did
   me the honor of a special call, and, after some desultory
   conversation, approached the all-absorbing topic of the day, and
   cautiously expressed his opinion as follows: Explaining his
   theory, as announced at the Congress, he said that "Holland,
   Belgium, and Denmark, being all low countries, some portions of
   each lying below the sea-level, he would not be surprised if the
   present outflow of lava devastated them all, and covered the
   bottom of the North Sea for many square leagues with a bed of
   basalt."The reason given was this: "That lava must continue to
   flow until, by its own action, it builds up around the volcanic
   crater a rim or cone high enough to afford a counterpoise to the
   centrifugal tendency of axial energy; and that, as the earth's
   crust was demonstrated to be exceptionally thin in the north of
   Europe, the height required in this instance would be so great
   that an enormous lapse of time must ensue before the self-created
   cone could obtain the necessary altitude.Before _AEtna_ attained
   its present secure height, it devastated an area as large as
   France; and Prof.Whitney has demonstrated that some center of
   volcanic action, now extinct, in the State of California, threw
   out a stream that covered a much greater surface, as the basaltic
   table mountains, vulgarly so called, extend north and south for a
   distance as great as from Moscow to Rome."In concluding his
   remarks, he ventured the prediction that "the North Sea would be
   completely filled up, and the British Islands again connected
   with the Continent."J. F., U.S.C._WILDEY'S DREAM._


    A blacksmith stood, at his anvil good,
          Just fifty years ago,
    And struck in his might, to the left and right,
          The iron all aglow.And fast and far, as each miniature star
          Illumined the dusky air,
    The sparks of his mind left a halo behind,
          Like the aureola of prayer.And the blacksmith thought, as he hammered and wrought,
          Just fifty years ago,
    Of the sins that start in the human heart
          When _its_ metal is all aglow;
    And he breathed a prayer, on the evening air,
          As he watched the fire-sparks roll,
    That with hammer and tongs, _he_ might right the wrongs
          That environ the human soul!When he leaned on his sledge, not like minion or drudge,
          With center in self alone,
    But with vision so grand, it embraced every land,
          In the sweep of its mighty zone;
    O'er mountain and main, o'er forest and plain,
          He gazed from his swarthy home,
    Till rafter and wall, grew up in a hall,
          That covered the world with its dome!'Neath that bending arch, with a tottering march
          All peoples went wailing by,
    To the music of groan, of sob, and of moan,
          To the grave that was yawning nigh,
    When the blacksmith rose and redoubled his blows
          On the iron that was aglow,
    Till his senses did seem to dissolve in a dream,
          Just fifty years ago.He thought that he stood upon a mountain chain,
    And gazed across an almost boundless plain;
    Men of all nations, and of every clime,
    Of ancient epochs, and of modern time,
    Rose in thick ranks before his wandering eye,
    And passed, like waves, in quick succession by.First came Osiris, with his Memphian band
    Of swarth Egyptians, darkening all the land;
    With heads downcast they dragged their limbs along,
    Laden with chains, and torn by lash and thong.From morn till eve they toiled and bled and died,
    And stained with blood the Nile's encroaching tide.Slowly upon the Theban plain there rose
    Old Cheop's pride, a pyramid of woes;
    And millions sank unpitied in their graves,
    With tombs inscribed--"Here lies a realm of slaves."Next came great Nimrod prancing on his steed,
    His serried ranks, Assyrian and Mede,
    By bold Sennacherib moulded into one,
    By bestial Sardanapalus undone.He saw the walls of Babylon arise,
    Spring from the earth, invade the azure skies,
    And bear upon their airy ramparts old
    Gardens and vines, and fruit, and flowers of gold.Beneath their cold and insalubrious shade
    All woes and vices had their coverts made;
    Lascivious incest o'er the land was sown,
    From peasant cabin to imperial throne,
    And that proud realm, so full of might and fame,
    Went down at last in blood, and sin, and shame.Then came the Persian, with his vast array
    Of armed millions, fretting for the fray,
    Led on by Xerxes and his harlot horde,
    Where billows swallowed, and where battle roared.On every side there rose a bloody screen,
    Till mighty Alexander closed the scene.in his pomp and pride,
    Dash through the world, and over myriads ride;
    Plant his proud pennon on the Gangean stream,
    Pierce where the tigers hide, mount where the eagles scream,
    And happy only amid war's alarms,
    The clank of fetters, and the clash of arms;
    And moulding man by battle-fields and blows,
    To one foul mass of furies, fiends and foes.Such, too, the Roman, vanquishing mankind,
    Their fields to ravage, and their limbs to bind;
    Whose proudest trophy, and whose highest good,
    To write his fame with pencil dipped in blood;
    To stride the world, like Ocean's turbid waves,
    And sink all nations into servient slaves.As passed the old, so modern realms swept by,
    Woe in all hearts, and tears in every eye;
    Crimes stained the noble, famine crushed the poor;
    Poison for kings, oppression for the boor;
    Force by the mighty, fraud by the feebler shown;
    Mercy a myth, and charity unknown.The Dreamer sighed, for sorrow filled his breast;
    Turned from the scene and sank to deeper rest.cried a low voice full of music sweet,
    "Come!"Down the steep hills they wend their toilsome way,
    Cross the vast plain that on their journey lay;
    Gain the dark city, through its suburbs roam,
    And pause at length within the dreamer's home.Again he stood at his anvil good
      With an angel by his side,
    And rested his sledge on its iron edge
      And blew up his bellows wide;
    He kindled the flame till the white heat came,
      Then murmured in accent low:
    "All ready am I your bidding to try
      So far as a mortal may go."'Midst the heat and the smoke the angel spoke,
      And breathed in his softest tone,
    "Heaven caught up your prayer on the evening air
      As it mounted toward the throne.God weaveth no task for mortals to ask
      Beyond a mortal's control,
    And with hammer and tongs you shall right the wrongs
      That encompass the human soul."But go you first forth '<DW41> the sons of the earth,
      And bring me a human heart
    That throbs for its kind, spite of weather and wind,
      And acts still a brother's part.The night groweth late, but here will I wait
      Till dawn streak the eastern skies;
    And lest you should fail, spread _my_ wings on the gale,
      And search with _my_ angel eyes."The dreamer once more passed the open door,
      But plumed for an angel's flight;
    He sped through the world like a thunderbolt hurled
      When the clouds are alive with light;
    He followed the sun till his race was won,
      And probed every heart and mind;
    But in every zone man labored alone
      For himself and not for his kind.All mournful and flushed, his dearest hopes crushed,
      The dreamer returned to his home,
    And stood in the flare of the forge's red glare,
      Besprinkled with dew and foam."The heart you have sought must be tempered and taught
      In the flame that is all aglow.""No heart could I find that was true to its kind,
      So I left all the world in its woe."Then the stern angel cried: "In your own throbbing side
      Beats a heart that is sound to the core;
    Will you give your own life to the edge of the knife
      For the widowed, the orphaned, and poor?""Most unworthy am I for my brothers to die,
      And sinful my sorrowing heart;
    But strike, if you will, to redeem or to kill,
      With life I am willing to part."Then he threw ope his vest and bared his broad breast
      To the angel's glittering blade;
    Soon the swift purple tide gushed a stream red and wide
      From the wound that the weapon had made.With a jerk and a start he then plucked out his heart,
      And buried it deep in the flame
    That flickered and fell like the flashes of hell
      O'er the dreamer's quivering frame."Now with hammer and tongs you may right all the wrongs
      That environ the human soul;
    But first, you must smite with a Vulcan's might
      The heart in yon blistering bowl."Quick the blacksmith arose, and redoubling his blows,
      Beat the heart that was all aglow,
    Till its fiery scars like a shower of stars
      Illumined the night with their flow.Every sling of his sledge reopened the edge
      Of wounds that were healed long ago;
    And from each livid chasm leaped forth a phantasm
      Of passion, of sin, or of woe.But he heeded no pain as he hammered amain,
      For the angel was holding the heart,
    And cried at each blow, "Strike high!"So he hammered and wrought, and he toiled and fought
      Till Aurora peeped over the plain;
    When the angel flew by and ascended the sky,
      _But left on the anvil a chain!_
    Its links were as bright as heaven's own light,
      As pure as the fountain of youth;
    And bore on each fold in letters of gold,
      This token--LOVE, FRIENDSHIP AND TRUTH.The dreamer awoke, and peered through the smoke
      At the anvil that slept by his side;
    And then in a wreath of flower-bound sheath,
      The triple-linked chain he espied.Odd Fellowship's gem is that bright diadem,
      Our emblem in age and in youth;
    For our hearts we must prove in the fire of LOVE,
      And mould with the hammer of TRUTH._WHITHERWARD._


By pursuing the analogies of nature, the human mind reduces to order the
vagaries of the imagination, and bodies them forth in forms of
loveliness and in similitudes of heaven.By an irrevocable decree of Nature's God, all his works are progressive
in the direction of himself.This law is traceable from the molehill up
to the mountain, from the mite up to the man.Geology, speaking to us
from the depths of a past eternity, from annals inscribed upon the
imperishable rock, utters not one syllable to contradict this tremendous
truth.Millions of ages ago, she commenced her impartial record, and as
we unroll it to-day, from the coal-bed and the marble quarry, we read in
creation's dawn as plainly as we behold in operation around us, the
mighty decree--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!In the shadowy past this majestic globe floated through the blue ether,
a boiling flood of lava.Time was not;
for as yet the golden laws of Kepler had not emerged from chaos.The sun
had not hemmed his bright-eyed daughters in, nor marked out on the azure
concave the paths they were to tread.The planets were not worlds, but
shot around the lurid center liquid masses of flame and desolation.Comets sported at random through the sky, and trailed after them their
horrid skirts of fire.The Spirit of God had not "moved upon the face of
the waters," and rosy Chaos still held the scepter in his hand.As the coral worm toils on in the unfathomable
depths of ocean, laying in secret the foundations of mighty continents,
destined as the ages roll by to emerge into light and grandeur, so the
laws of the universe carried on their everlasting work.An eternity elapsed, and the age of fire passed away.A new era dawned
upon the earth.The gases were generated, and the elements of air and
water overspread the globe.Islands began to appear, at first presenting
pinnacles of bare and blasted granite; but gradually, by decay and
decomposition, changing into dank marshes and fertile plains.One after another the sensational universe now springs into being.This
but prepared the way for the animated, and that in turn formed the
groundwork and basis for the human.Man then came forth, the result of
all her previous efforts--nature's pet, her paragon and her pride.Reason sits enthroned upon his brow, and the soul wraps its sweet
affections about his heart; angels spread their wings above him, and God
calls him His child.He treads the earth its acknowledged monarch, and
commences its subjection.One by one the elements have yielded to his
sway, nature has revealed her hoariest secrets to his ken, and heaven
thrown wide its portals to his spirit.He stands now upon the very acme
of the visible creation, and with straining eye, and listening ear, and
anxious heart, whispers to himself that terrific and tremendous
word--WHITHERWARD!Late one afternoon in April, I was sitting on the grassy <DW72> of
Telegraph Hill, watching the waves of sunset as they rolled in from the
west, and broke in crimson spray upon the peaks of the Contra Costa
hills.I was alone; and, as my custom is, was ruminating upon the grand
problem of futurity.The broad and beautiful bay spread out like a sea
of silver at my feet, and the distant mountains, reflecting the rays of
the setting sun, seemed to hem it in with barriers of gold.The city lay
like a tired infant at evening in its mother's arms, and only at
intervals disturbed my reflections by its expiring sobs.The hours of
business I well knew had passed, and the heavy iron door had long since
grated on its hinges, and the fire-proof shutter been bolted for the
night.But I felt that my labors had just commenced.The duties of my
profession had swallowed up thought throughout the long hours devoted to
the cares of life, and it was not until I was released from their
thraldom that I found myself in truth a slave.The one master-thought
came back into my brain, until it burned its hideous image there in
letters of fire--WHITHERWARD!The past came up before me with its long memories of Egyptian grandeur,
with its triumphs of Grecian art, with its burden of Roman glory.Italy
came with her republics, her "starry" Galileo, and her immortal
Buonarotti.France flashed by, with her garments dyed in blood, and her
Napoleons in chains.England rose up with her arts and her arms, her
commerce and her civilization, her splendor and her shame.I beheld
Newton gazing at the stars, heard Milton singing of Paradise, and saw
Russell expiring on the scaffold.But ever and anon a pale,
thorn-crowned monarch, arrayed in mock-purple, and bending beneath a
cross, would start forth at my side, and with uplifted eye, but
speechless lip, point with one hand to the pages of a volume I had open
on my knee, and with the other to the blue heaven above.Judea would
then pass with solemn tread before me.Her patriarchs, her prophets and
her apostles, her judges, her kings, and her people, one by one came and
went like the phantasmagoria of a dream.The present then rose up in
glittering robes, its feet resting upon the mounds of Nimrod, its brow
encircled with a coronet of stars, pillaging, with one hand, the cloud
above of its lightnings, and sending them forth with the other, bridled
and subdued, to the uttermost ends of the earth.Earth's physical history also swept by in full
review.All nature lent her stores, and with an effort of mind, by no
means uncommon for those who have long thought upon a single subject, I
seemed to possess the power to generalize all that I had ever heard,
read or seen, into one gorgeous picture, and hang it up in the wide
heavens before me.The actual scenery around me entirely disappeared, and I beheld an
immense pyramid of alabaster, reared to the very stars, upon whose sides
I saw inscribed a faithful history of the past.Its foundations were in
deep shadow, but the light gradually increased toward the top, until its
summit was bathed in the most refulgent lustre.Inscribed in golden letters I read on one of its sides these words, in
alternate layers, rising gradually to the apex: "_Granite_, _Liquid_,
_Gas_, _Electricity_;" on another, "_Inorganic_, _Vegetable_, _Animal_,
_Human_;" on the third side, "_Consciousness_, _Memory_, _Reason_,
_Imagination_;" and on the fourth, "_Chaos_, _Order_, _Harmony_,
_Love_."At this moment I beheld the figure of a human being standing at the
base of the pyramid, and gazing intently upward.He then placed his foot
upon the foundation, and commenced climbing toward the summit.I caught
a distinct view of his features, and perceived that they were black and
swarthy like those of the most depraved Hottentot.He toiled slowly
upward, and as he passed the first layer, he again looked toward me, and
I observed that his features had undergone a complete transformation.He passed the second
layer; and as he entered the third, once more presented his face to me
for observation.Another change had overspread it, and I readily
recognized in him the tawny native of Malacca or Hindoostan.As he
reached the last layer, and entered its region of refulgent light, I
caught a full glimpse of his form and features, and beheld the high
forehead, the glossy ringlets, the hazel eye, and the alabaster skin of
the true Caucasian.I now observed for the first time that the pyramid was left unfinished,
and that its summit, instead of presenting a well-defined peak, was in
reality a level plain.In a few moments more, the figure I had traced
from the base to the fourth layer, reached the apex, and stood with
folded arms and upraised brow upon the very summit.His lips parted as
if about to speak, and as I leaned forward to hear, I caught, in
distinct tone and thrilling accent, that word which had so often risen
to my own lips for utterance, and seared my very brain, because
unanswered--WHITHERWARD!exclaimed I, aloud, shuddering at the sepulchral
sound of my voice."Home," responded a tiny voice at my side, and
turning suddenly around, my eyes met those of a sweet little
school-girl, with a basket of flowers upon her arm, who had approached
me unobserved, and who evidently imagined I had addressed her when I
spoke."Yes, little daughter," replied I, "'tis time to proceed
homeward, for the sun has ceased to gild the summit of Diavolo, and the
evening star is visible in the west.I will attend you home," and taking
her proffered hand, I descended the hill, with the dreadful word still
ringing in my ears, and the fadeless vision still glowing in my heart.#       #       #       #       #

Midnight had come and gone, and still the book lay open on my knee.The
candle had burned down close to the socket, and threw a flickering
glimmer around my chamber; but no indications of fatigue or slumber
visited my eyelids.My temples throbbed heavily, and I felt the hot and
excited blood playing like the piston-rod of an engine between my heart
and brain.I had launched forth on the broad ocean of speculation, and now
perceived, when too late, the perils of my situation.Above me were
dense and lowering clouds, which no eye could penetrate; around me
howling tempests, which no voice could quell; beneath me heaving
billows, which no oil could calm.I thought of Plato struggling with his
doubts; of Epicurus sinking beneath them; of Socrates swallowing his
poison; of Cicero surrendering himself to despair.I remembered how all
the great souls of the earth had staggered beneath the burden of the
same thought, which weighed like a thousand Cordilleras upon my own; and
as I pressed my hand upon my burning brow, I cried again and
again--WHITHERWARD!I could find no relief in philosophy; for I knew her maxims by heart
from Zeno and the Stagirite down to Berkeley and Cousin.I had followed
her into all her hiding-places, and courted her in all her moods.No
coquette was ever half so false, so fickle, and so fair.Her robes are
woven of the sunbeams, and a star adorns her brow; but she sits
impassive upon her icy throne, and wields no scepter but despair.The
light she throws around is not the clear gleam of the sunshine, nor the
bright twinkle of the star; but glances in fitful glimmerings on the
soul, like the aurora on the icebergs of the pole, and lightens up the
scene only to show its utter desolation.The Bible lay open before me, but I could find no comfort there.Its
lessons were intended only for the meek and humble, and my heart was
cased in pride.It reached only to the believing; I was tossed on an
ocean of doubt.It required, as a condition to faith, the innocence of
an angel and the humility of a child; I had long ago seared my
conscience by mingling in the busy scenes of life, and was proud of my
mental acquirements.The Bible spoke comfort to the Publican; I was of
the straight sect of the Pharisees.Its promises were directed to the
poor in spirit, whilst mine panted for renown.At this moment, whilst heedlessly turning over its leaves and scarcely
glancing at their contents, my attention was arrested by this remarkable
passage in one of Paul's epistles: "That was not _first_ which is
spiritual, but that which was natural, and _afterward_ that which is
spiritual.Behold, I show you a mystery: _we shall not all sleep_, but
we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the
last trump."Again and again I read this text, for it promised more by reflection
than at first appeared in the words.Slowly a light broke in on the
horizon's verge, and I felt, for the first time in my whole life, that
the past was not all inexplicable, nor the future a chaos, but that the
human soul, lit up by the torch of science!and guided by the
prophecies of Holy Writ, might predict the path it is destined to tread,
and read in advance the history of its final enfranchisement.Paul
evidently intended to teach the doctrine of _progress_, even in its
applicability to man.He did not belong to that narrow-minded sect in
philosophy, which declares that the earth and the heavens are finished;
that man is the crowning glory of his Maker, and the utmost stretch of
His creative power; that henceforth the globe which he inhabits is
barren, and can produce no being superior to himself.On the contrary,
he clearly intended to teach the same great truth which modern science
is demonstrating to all the world, that progression is nature's first
law, and that even in the human kingdom the irrevocable decree has gone
forth--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!Such were my reflections when the last glimmer of the candle flashed up
like a meteor, and then as suddenly expired in night.I was glad that
the shadows were gone.Better, thought I, is utter darkness than that
poor flame which renders it visible.But I had suddenly grown rich in
thought.A clue had been furnished to the labyrinth in which I had
wandered from a child; a hint had been planted in the mind which it
would be impossible ever to circumscribe or extinguish.One letter had
been identified by which, like Champollion le Jeune, I could eventually
decipher the inscription on the pyramid.What are these spectral
apparitions which rear themselves in the human mind, and are called by
mortals _hints_?Who lodges them in the chambers of
the mind, where they sprout and germinate, and bud and blossom, and
bear?The Florentine caught one as it fell from the stars, and invented the
telescope to observe them.Columbus caught another, as it was whispered
by the winds, and they wafted him to the shores of a New World.Franklin
beheld one flash forth from the cloud, and he traced the lightnings to
their bourn.Another dropped from the skies into the brain of Leverrier,
and he scaled the very heavens, till he unburied a star.Rapidly was my mind working out the solution of the problem which had so
long tortured it, based upon the intimation it had derived from St.Paul's epistle, when most unexpectedly, and at the same time most
unwelcomely, I fell into one of those strange moods which can neither be
called sleep nor consciousness, but which leave their impress far more
powerfully than the visions of the night or the events of the day.I beheld a small egg, most beautifully dotted over, and stained.Whilst
my eye rested on it, it cracked; an opening was made _from within_, and
almost immediately afterward a bird of glittering plumage and mocking
song flew out, and perched on the bough of a rose-tree, beneath whose
shadow I found myself reclining.Before my surprise had vanished, I
beheld a painted worm at my feet, crawling toward the root of the tree
which was blooming above me.It soon reached the trunk, climbed into the
branches, and commenced spinning its cocoon.Hardly had it finished its
silken home, ere it came forth in the form of a gorgeous butterfly, and,
spreading its wings, mounted toward the heavens.Quickly succeeding
this, the same pyramid of alabaster, which I had seen from the summit of
Telegraph Hill late in the afternoon, rose gradually upon the view.It
was in nowise changed; the inscriptions on the sides were the same, and
the identical figure stood with folded arms and uplifted brow upon the
top.I now heard a rushing sound, such as stuns the ear at Niagara, or
greets it during a hurricane at sea, when the shrouds of the ship are
whistling to the blast, and the flashing billows are dashing against her
sides.Suddenly the pyramid commenced changing its form, and before many
moments elapsed it had assumed the rotundity of a globe, and I beheld it
covered with seas, and hills, and lakes, and mountains, and plains, and
fertile fields.But the human figure still stood upon its crest.Then
came forth the single blast of a bugle, such as the soldier hears on the
morn of a world-changing battle.Caesar heard it at Pharsalia, Titus at
Jerusalem, Washington at Yorktown, and Wellington at Waterloo.No lightning flash ever rended forest king from crest to root quicker
than the transformation which now overspread the earth.In a second of
time it became as transparent as crystal, and as brilliant as the sun.But in every other respect it preserved its identity.On casting my eyes
toward the human being, I perceived that he still preserved his
position, but his feet did not seem to touch the earth.He appeared to
be floating upon its arch, as the halcyon floats in the atmosphere.His
features were lit up with a heavenly radiance, and assumed an expression
of superhuman beauty.The thought crossed my mind, Can this be a spirit?As sudden as the
question came forth the response, "I am."But, inquired my mind, for my
lips did not move, you have never passed the portals of the grave?Again
I read in his features the answer, "For ages this earth existed as a
natural body, and all its inhabitants partook of its characteristics;
gradually it approached the spiritual state, and by a law like that
which transforms the egg into the songster, or the worm into the
butterfly, it has just accomplished one of its mighty cycles, and now
gleams forth with the refulgence of the stars.I did not die, but passed
as naturally into the spiritual world as the huge earth itself.Prophets
and apostles predicted this change many hundred years ago; but the blind
infatuation of our race did not permit them to realize its truth.Your
own mind, in common with the sages of all time, long brooded over the
idea, and oftentimes have you exclaimed, in agony and
dismay--WHITHERWARD!The revolution may not come in the year
allotted you, but so surely as St.Paul spoke inspiration, so surely as
science elicits truth, so surely as the past prognosticates the future,
the natural world must pass into the spiritual, and everything be
changed in the twinkling of an eye.your own ears may hear
the clarion note, your own eyes witness the transfiguration."Slowly the vision faded away, and left me straining my gaze into the
dark midnight which now shrouded the world, and endeavoring to calm my
heart, which throbbed as audibly as the hollow echoes of a drum.When
the morning sun peeped over the Contra Costa range, I still sat silent
and abstracted in my chair, revolving over the incidents of the night,
but thankful that, though the reason is powerless to brush away the
clouds which obscure the future, yet the imagination may spread its
wings, and, soaring into the heavens beyond them, answer the soul when
in terror she inquires--WHITHERWARD!_OUR WEDDING-DAY._


                   I.

    A dozen springs, and more, dear Sue,
      Have bloomed, and passed away,
    Since hand in hand, and heart to heart,
      We spent our wedding-day.Youth blossomed on our cheeks, dear Sue,
      Joy chased each tear of woe,
    When first we promised to be true,
      That morning long ago.Though many cares have come, dear Sue,
      To checker life's career,
    As down its pathway we have trod,
      In trembling and in fear.Still in the darkest storm, dear Sue,
      That lowered o'er the way,
    We clung the closer, while it blew,
      And laughed the clouds away.'Tis true, our home is humble, Sue,
      And riches we have not,
    But children gambol round our door,
      And consecrate the spot.Our sons are strong and brave, dear Sue,
      Our daughters fair and gay,
    But none so beautiful as you,
      Upon our wedding-day.No grief has crossed our threshold, Sue,
      No crape festooned the door,
    But health has waved its halcyon wings,
      And plenty filled our store.Then let's be joyful, darling Sue,
      And chase dull cares away,
    And kindle rosy hope anew,
      As on our wedding-day.[Decoration]

XVII._THE OLD YEAR AND THE NEW._


    One more flutter of time's restless wing,
    One more furrow in the forehead of spring;
    One more step in the journey of fate,
    One more ember gone out in life's grate;
    One more gray hair in the head of the sage,
    One more round in the ladder of age;
    One leaf more in the volume of doom,
    And one span less in the march to the tomb,
    Since brothers, we gathered around bowl and tree,
    And Santa Claus welcomed with frolic and glee.How has thy life been speeding
          Since Aurora, at the dawn,
        Peeped within thy portals, leading
          The babe year, newly born?Has thy soul been scorched by sorrow,
          Has some spectre nestled there?And with every new to-morrow,
          Sowed the seeds of fresh despair?Burst its chain with strength sublime,
        For behold!I bring another,
          And a fairer child of time.Have thy barns been brimming o'er?Will thy stature fit the niches
          Hewn for Hercules of yore?the rolling planet
          Starts on a nobler round.But perhaps across thy vision
          Death had cast its shadow there,
        And thy home, once all elysian,
          Now crapes an empty chair;
        Or happier, thy dominions,
          Spreading broad and deep and strong,
        Re-echo 'neath love's pinions
          To a pretty cradle song!God's blessing on your head;
        Joy for the living mother,
          Peace with the loving dead.[Decoration]

XVIII._A PAIR OF MYTHS:_

BEING A CHAPTER FROM AN UNPUBLISHED WORK.Eight days passed away unreckoned, and still I remained unconscious of
everything occurring around me.The morning of the ninth dawned, dragged
heavily along, and noon approached, whilst I lay in the same comatose
state.No alteration had taken place, except that a deeper and sounder
sleep seemed to have seized upon me; a symptom hailed by my physician
with joy, but regarded by my mother with increased alarm.Suddenly, the incautious closing of my chamber door, as my sister, Miss
Lucy Stanly, then in her fifteenth year, entered the apartment, aroused
me from slumber and oblivion.I endeavored to recall something
of the past, but memory for a long time refused its aid, and I appeared
as fatally and irremediably unconscious as ever.Gradually, however, my
shattered mind recovered its faculties, and in less than an hour after
my awakening, I felt perfectly restored.No pain tormented me, and no
torpor benumbed my faculties.I rapidly reviewed, mentally, the
occurrences of the day before, when, as I imagined, the disaster had
happened, and resolved at once to rise from my bed and prosecute my
intended journey.At this moment my father entered the apartment, and observing that I
was awake, ventured to speak to me kindly and in a very low tone.I
smiled at his uneasiness, and immediately relieved him from all
apprehension, by conversing freely and intelligibly of the late
catastrophe.He seized my hand a thousand
times, and pressed it again and again to his lips.At length,
remembering that my mother was ignorant of my complete restoration, he
rushed from the room, in order to be the first to convey the welcome
intelligence.My bed was soon surrounded by the whole family, chattering away, wild
with joy, and imprinting scores of kisses on my lips, cheeks and
forehead.The excitement proved too severe for me in my weak condition,
and had not the timely arrival of the physician intervened to clear my
chamber of every intruder, except Mamma Betty, as we all called the
nurse, these pages in all probability would never have arrested the
reader's eye.As it was, I suddenly grew very sick and faint; everything
around me assumed a deep green tinge, and I fell into a deathlike swoon.Another morning's sun was shining cheerily in at my window, when
consciousness again returned.The doctor was soon at my side, and
instead of prescribing physic as a remedy, requested my sister to sit at
my bedside, and read in a low tone any interesting little story she
might select.He cautioned her not to mention, even in the most casual
manner, _Mormonism_, _St.Louis_, or the _Moselle_, which order she most
implicitly obeyed; nor could all my ingenuity extract a solitary remark
in relation to either.My sister was not very long in making a selection; for, supposing what
delighted herself would not fail to amuse me, she brought in a
manuscript, carefully folded, and proceeded at once to narrate its
history.It was written by my father, as a sort of model or sampler for
my brothers and sisters, which they were to imitate when composition-day
came round, instead of "hammering away," as he called it, on moral
essays and metaphysical commonplaces.It was styled


THE KING OF THE NINE-PINS: A MYTH.Heinrich Schwarz, or Black Hal, as he was wont to be called, was an old
toper, but he was possessed of infinite good humor, and related a great
many very queer stories, the truth of which no one, that I ever heard
of, had the hardihood to doubt; for Black Hal had an uncommon share of
"Teutonic pluck" about him, and was at times very unceremonious in the
display of it.But Hal had a weakness--it was not liquor, for that was
his strength--which he never denied; _Hal was too fond of nine-pins_.He
had told me, in confidence, that "many a time and oft" he had rolled
incessantly for weeks together.I think I heard him say that he once
rolled for a month, day and night, without stopping a single moment to
eat or to drink, or even to catch his breath.I did not question his veracity at the time; but since, on reflection,
the fact seems almost incredible; and were it not that this sketch might
accidentally fall in his way, I might be tempted to show philosophically
that such a thing could not possibly be.And yet I have read of very
long fasts in my day--that, for instance, of Captain Riley in the Great
Sahara, and others, which will readily occur to the reader.But I must
not episodize, or I shall not reach my story.Black Hal was sitting late one afternoon in a Nine-Pin Alley, in the
little town of Kaatskill, in the State of New York--it is true, for he
said so--when a tremendous thunder-storm invested his retreat.His
companions, one by one, had left him, until, rising from his seat and
gazing around, he discovered that he was alone.The alley-keeper, too,
could nowhere be found, and the boys who were employed to set up the
pins had disappeared with the rest.It was growing very late, and Hal
had a long walk, and he thought it most prudent to get ready to start
home.The lightning glared in at the door and windows most vividly, and
the heavy thunder crashed and rumbled and roared louder than he had ever
heard it before.The rain, too, now commenced to batter down
tremendously, and just as night set in, Hal had just got ready to set
out.Hal first felt uneasy, next unhappy, and finally miserable.If he
had but a boy to talk to!A verse
that he learned in his boyhood, across the wide sea, came unasked into
his mind.It always came there precisely at the time he did not desire
its company.It ran thus:

    "Oh!for the might of dread Odin
       The powers upon him shed,
     For a sail in the good ship Skidbladnir,[A-236]
       And a talk with Mimir's head!"[B-236]

[Footnote A-236: The ship Skidbladnir was the property of Odin.He could
sail in it on the most dangerous seas, and yet could fold it up and
carry it in his pocket.][Footnote B-236: Mimir's head was always the companion of Odin.When he
desired to know what was transpiring in distant countries, he inquired
of Mimir, and always received a correct reply.]This verse was repeated over and over again inaudibly.Gradually,
however, his voice became a little louder, and a little louder still,
until finally poor Hal hallooed it vociferously forth so sonorously that
it drowned the very thunder.He had repeated it just seventy-seven
times, when suddenly a monstrous head was thrust in at the door, and
demanded, in a voice that sounded like the maelstrom, "What do _you_
want with Odin?""Oh, nothing--nothing in the world, I thank you, sir,"
politely responded poor Hal, shaking from head to foot.Here the head
was followed by the shoulders, arms, body and legs of a giant at least
forty feet high.Of course he came in on all fours, and approached in
close proximity to Black Hal.Hal involuntarily retreated, as far as he
could, reciting to himself the only prayer he remembered, "Now I lay me
down to sleep," etc.The giant did not appear desirous of pursuing Hal, being afraid--so Hal
said--that he would draw his knife on him.But be the cause what it
might, he seated himself at the head of the nine-pin alley, and shouted,
"Stand up!"As he did so, the nine-pins at the other end arose and took
their places."Now, sir," said he, turning again to Hal, "I'll bet you an ounce of
your blood I can beat you rolling."Hal trembled again, but meekly replied, "Please, sir, we don't bet
_blood_ nowadays--we bet _money_.""Blood's my money," roared forth the giant.Hal tried in
vain to hoist the window."Yes, sir," said Hal; and he thought as it was only _an ounce_, he could
spare that without much danger, and it might appease the monster's
appetite."Yes, sir," replied Hal, as he seized what he supposed to be the largest
and his favorite ball."What are you doing with Mimir's head?""I beg your pardon, most humbly," began Hal, as he let the bloody head
fall; "I did not mean any harm."Hal fell on his knees and recited most devoutly, "Now I lay me down,"
etc.I say," and the giant seized poor Hal by the collar
and set him on his feet.He now selected a large ball, and poising it carefully in his hand, ran
a few steps, and sent it whirling right in among the nine-pins; but what
was his astonishment to behold them jump lightly aside, and permit the
ball to pass in an avenue directly through the middle of the alley.The second and third ball met with no better success.Odin--for Hal said it was certainly he, as he had Mimir's head
along--now grasped a ball and rolled it with all his might; but long
before it reached the nine-pins, they had, every one of them, tumbled
down, and lay sprawling on the alley.said the giant, as he grinned most gleefully at poor Hal.Taking another ball, he
hurled it down the alley, and the same result followed."I give up the game," whined out Hal."Then you lose double," rejoined Odin.Hal readily consented to pay two ounces, for he imagined, by yielding at
once, he would so much the sooner get rid of his grim companion.As he
said so, Odin pulled a pair of scales out of his coat pocket, made
proportionably to his own size.He poised them upon a beam in the alley,
and drew forth what he denominated two ounces, and put them in one
scale.Each ounce was about the size of a twenty-eight pound weight, and
was quite as heavy.shouted the giant, as he
grasped the gasping and terrified gambler.He soon rolled up his
sleeves, and bound his arm with a pocket handkerchief.Next he drew
forth a lancet as long as a sword, and drove the point into the biggest
vein he could discover.When he returned to
consciousness, the sun was shining brightly in at the window, and the
sweet rumbling of the balls assured him that he still lay where the
giant left him.On rising to his feet he perceived that a large coagulum
of blood had collected where his head rested all night, and that he
could scarcely walk from the effects of his exhaustion.He returned
immediately home and told his wife all that had occurred; and though,
like some of the neighbors, she distrusted the tale, yet she never
intimated her doubts to Black Hal himself.The alley-keeper assured me
in a whisper, one day, that upon the very night fixed on by Hal for the
adventure, he was beastly drunk, and had been engaged in a fight with
one of his boon companions, who gave him a black eye and a bloody nose.But the alley-keeper was always jealous of Black Hal's superiority in
story telling; besides, he often drank too much himself, and I suspect
he originated the report he related to me in a fit of wounded pride, or
drunken braggadocio.One thing is certain, he never ventured to repeat
the story in the presence of Black Hal himself.#       #       #       #       #

In spite of the attention I endeavored to bestow on the marvelous
history of Black Hal and his grim companion, my mind occasionally
wandered far away, and could only find repose in communing with her who
I now discovered for the first time held in her own hands the thread of
my destiny.Lucy was not blind to these fits of abstraction, and
whenever they gained entire control of my attention, she would pause,
lay down the manuscript, and threaten most seriously to discontinue the
perusal, unless I proved a better listener.I ask no man's pardon for
declaring that my sister was an excellent reader.Most brothers, perhaps
think the same of most sisters; but there _was_ a charm in Lucy's accent
and a distinctness in her enunciation I have never heard excelled.Owing
to these qualities, as much, perhaps, as to the strangeness of the
story, I became interested in the fate of the drunken gambler, and when
Lucy concluded, I was ready to exclaim, "And pray where is Black Hal
now?"My thoughts took another direction, however, and I impatiently demanded
whether or not the sample story had been imitated.A guilty blush
assured me quite as satisfactorily as words could have done, that Miss
Lucy had herself made an attempt, and I therefore insisted that as she
had whetted and excited the appetite, it would be highly
unfraternal--(particularly in my present very precarious
condition)--that parenthesis settled the matter--to deny me the means of
satisfying it."But you'll laugh at me," timidly whispered my sister."Of course I shall," said I, "if your catastrophe is half as melancholy
as Black Hal's.But make haste, or I shall be off to St.But pray
inform me, what is the subject of your composition?""I believe, on my soul," responded I, laughing outright, "you girls
never think about anything else."I provoked no reply, and the manuscript being unfolded, my sister thus
attempted to elucidate


THE ORIGIN OF MARRIAGE.Professor Williams having ceased his manipulations, my eyes
involuntarily closed, and I became unconscious to everything occurring
around me.There's truth in mesmerism, after all, thought I, and being
in the clairvoyant state, I beheld a most beautiful comet at this moment
emerging from the constellation Taurus, and describing a curve about the
star Zeta, one of the Pleiades.and as this thought entered my brain, I grasped a hair in the tail of
the comet as it whizzed by me.I climbed up the glittering hair until I found myself seated very
comfortably on the comet's back, and was beginning to enjoy my starlit
ramble exceedingly, when I was suddenly aroused from my meditations by
the song of a heavenly minstrel, who, wandering from star to star and
system to system, sang the fate of other worlds and other beings to
those who would listen to his strains and grant him the rites of
hospitality.As I approached, his tones were suddenly changed, his voice
lowered into a deeper key, and gazing intently at me, or at what
evidenced my presence to his sight, thus began:

The flaming sword of the cherub, which had waved so frightfully above
the gate of the garden of Eden, had disappeared; the angel himself was
gone; and Adam, as he approached the spot where so lately he had enjoyed
the delights of heaven, beheld with astonishment and regret that
Paradise and all its splendors had departed from the earth forever.Where the garden lately bloomed, he could discover only the dark and
smouldering embers of a conflagration; a hard lava had incrusted itself
along the golden walks; the birds were flown, the flowers withered, the
fountains dried up, and desolation brooded over the scene.sighed the patriarch of men, "where are now the pleasures which I
once enjoyed along these peaceful avenues?Where are all those
beautiful spirits, given by Heaven to watch over and protect me?Each
guardian angel has deserted me, and the rainbow glories of Paradise have
flown.No more the sun shines out in undimmed splendor, for clouds array
him in gloom; the earth, forgetful of her verdure and her flowers,
produces thorns to wound and frosts to chill me.The very air, once all
balm and zephyrs, now howls around me with the voice of the storm and
the fury of the hurricane.No more the notes of peace and happiness
greet my ears, but the harsh tones of strife and battle resound on every
side.Nature has kindled the flames of discord in her own bosom, and
universal war has begun his reign!"And then the father of mankind hid his face in the bosom of his
companion, and wept the bitter tears of contrition and repentance."Oh, do not weep so bitterly, my Adam," exclaimed his companion."True,
we are miserable, but all is not yet lost; we have forfeited the smiles
of Heaven, but we may yet regain our lost place in its affections.Let
us learn from our misfortunes the anguish of guilt, but let us learn
also the mercy of redemption."Oh, talk not of happiness now," interrupted Adam; "that nymph who once
wailed at our side, attentive to the beck, has disappeared, and fled
from the companionship of such guilty, fallen beings as ourselves,
forever.""Not forever, Adam," kindly rejoined Eve; "she may yet be lurking among
these groves, or lie hid behind yon hills.""Then let us find her," quickly responded Adam; "you follow the sun,
sweet Eve, to his resting-place, whilst I will trace these sparkling
waters to their bourn.Let us ramble this whole creation o'er; and when
we have found her, let us meet again on this very spot, and cling to her
side, until the doom of death shall overtake us."And the eye of Adam beamed with hope, then kindled for the first time on
earth in the bosom of man; and he bade Eve his first farewell, and
started eastward in his search.Eve turned her face to the west, and set out on her allotted journey.The sun had shone a hundred times in midsummer splendor, and a hundred
times had hid himself in the clouds of winter, and yet no human foot had
trod the spot where the garden of Eden once bloomed.Adam had in vain
traced the Euphrates to the sea, and climbed the Himalaya Mountains.In
vain had he endured the tropical heats on the Ganges, and the winter's
cold in Siberia.He stood at last upon the borders of that narrow sea
which separates Asia from America, and casting a wistful glance to the
far-off continent, exclaimed: "In yon land, so deeply blue in the
distance, that it looks like heaven, Happiness may have taken refuge.I will return to Eden, and learn if
Eve, too, has been unsuccessful."And then he took one more look at the distant land, sighed his adieu,
and set out on his return.First child of misery, first daughter of despair!Poor Eve,
with the blue of heaven in her eye, and the crimson of shame upon her
lip!Poor Eve, arrayed in beauty, but hastening to decay--she, too, was
unsuccessful.Wandering in her westward way, the azure waters of the Mediterranean
soon gleamed upon her sight.She stood at length upon the pebbly shore,
and the glad waves, silent as death before, when they kissed her naked
feet, commenced that song still heard in their eternal roar.A mermaid
seemed to rise from the waters at her feet, and to imitate her every
motion.Her long dark tresses, her deep blue eyes, her rosy cheek, her
sorrowful look, all were reflected in the mermaid before her."Sweet spirit," said Eve, "canst thou inform me where the nymph
Happiness lies concealed?She always stood beside us in the garden of
Eden; but when we were driven from Paradise we beheld her no more."The lips of the mermaid moved, but Eve could hear no reply.mother of mankind, the crystal waters of every sea, reflecting thy
lovely image, still faithful to their trust, conceal a mermaid in their
bosom for every daughter of beauty who looks upon them!Neither the orange groves of the Arno, nor the vineyards of France;
neither the forests of Germania, nor the caves of Norway, concealed the
sought-for nymph.Her track was imprinted in the
sands of Sahara, by the banks of the Niger, on the rocks of Bengola, in
the vales of Abyssinia--but all in vain.Come, Death," cried Eve; "come now, and take me where thou
wilt.This world is a desert, for Happiness has left it desolate."A gentle slumber soon overcame the wearied child of sorrow, and in her
sleep a vision came to comfort her.She dreamed that she stood before an
aged man, whose hoary locks attested that the snows of many winters had
whitened them, and in whose glance she recognized the spirit of Wisdom."Aged Father," said Eve, "where is Happiness?"and then she burst into a
flood of tears."Comfort thyself, Daughter," mildly answered the old man; "Happiness yet
dwells on earth, but she is no longer visible.A temple is built for her
in every mortal's bosom, but she never ascends her throne until welcomed
there by the child of Honor and Love."The morning sun aroused Eve from her slumber, but did not dispel the
memory of her dream."I will return to Eden, and there await until the
child of Honor and Love shall enthrone in my bosom the lost nymph
Happiness;" and saying this, she turned her face to the eastward, and
thinking of Adam and her vision, journeyed joyfully along.The sun of Spring had opened the flowers and clothed the woods in
verdure; had freed the streams from their icy fetters, and inspired the
warbling world with harmony, when two forlorn and weary travelers
approached the banks of the river Pison; that river which had flowed
through the garden of Eden when the first sunshine broke upon the world.A hundred years had rolled away, and the echo of no human voice had
resounded through the deserted groves.At length the dusky figures
emerged from the overshadowing shrubbery, and raised their eyes into
each other's faces.One bound--one cry--and they weep for joy in each
other's arms.Adam related his sad and melancholy story, and then Eve soon finished
hers.But no sooner had she told her dream, than Adam, straining her to
his bosom, exclaimed:

"There is no mystery here, my Eve.If Happiness on earth be indeed the
child of Honor and Love, it must be in Matrimony alone.What else now
left us on earth can lay claim to the precious boon?Approved by heaven,
and cherished by man, in the holy bonds of Matrimony it must consist;
and if this be all, we need seek no further; it is ours!"They then knelt in prayer, and returned thanks to Heaven, that though
the garden of Eden was a wild, and the nymph Happiness no longer an
angel at their side, yet that her spirit was still present in every
bosom where the heart is linked to Honor and Love by the sacred ties of
Matrimony.[Decoration]

XIX._THE LAST OF HIS RACE._


    No further can fate tempt or try me,
      With guerdon of pleasure or pain;
    Ere the noon of my life has sped by me,
      The last of my race I remain.To that home so long left I might journey;
      But they for whose greeting I yearn,
    Are launched on that shadowy ocean
      Whence voyagers never return.My life is a blank in creation,
      My fortunes no kindred may share;
    No brother to cheer desolation,
      No sister to soften by prayer;
    No father to gladden my triumphs,
      No mother my sins to atone;
    No children to lean on in dying--
      I must finish my journey alone!In that hall, where their feet tripp'd before me,
      How lone would now echo my tread!While each fading portrait threw o'er me
      The chill, stony smile of the dead.One sad thought bewilders my slumbers,
      From eve till the coming of dawn:
    I cry out in visions, "_Where are they_?"And echo responds, "_They are gone_!"But fain, ere the life-fount grows colder,
      I'd wend to that lone, distant place,
    That row of green hillocks, where moulder
      The rest of my early doom'd race.There slumber the true and the manly,
      There slumber the spotless and fair;
    And when my last journey is ended,
      My place of repose be it there![Decoration]

XX._THE TWO GEORGES._


Between the years of our Lord 1730 and 1740, two men were born on
opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, whose lives were destined to exert
a commanding influence on the age in which they lived, as well as to
control the fortunes of many succeeding generations.One was by birth a plain peasant, the son of a Virginia farmer; the
other an hereditary Prince, and the heir of an immense empire.It will
be the main object of this sketch to trace the histories of these two
individuals, so dissimilar in their origin, from birth to death, and
show how it happened that one has left a name synonymous with tyranny,
whilst the other will descend to the lowest posterity, radiant with
immortal glory, and renowned the world over as the friend of virtue, the
guardian of liberty, and the benefactor of his race.Go with me for one moment to the crowded and splendid metropolis of
England.It is the evening of the 4th of June 1734.Some joyful event
must have occurred, for the bells are ringing merrily, and the
inhabitants are dressed in holiday attire.Nor is the circumstance of a
private nature, for banners are everywhere displayed, the vast city is
illuminated, and a thousand cannon are proclaiming it from their iron
throats.The population seem frantic with joy, and rush tumultuously
into each other's arms, in token of a national jubilee.Tens of
thousands are hurrying along toward a splendid marble pile, situated on
a commanding eminence, near the river Thames, whilst from the loftiest
towers of St.James's Palace the national ensigns of St.George and the
Red Cross are seen floating on the breeze.Within one of the most
gorgeously furnished apartments of that royal abode, the wife of
Frederic, Prince of Wales, and heir apparent to the British Empire, has
just been delivered of a son.The scions of royalty crowd into the
bed-chamber, and solemnly attest the event as one on which the destiny
of a great empire is suspended.The corridors are thronged with dukes,
and nobles, and soldiers, and courtiers, all anxious to bend the supple
knee, and bow the willing neck, to power just cradled into the world.A
Royal Proclamation soon follows, commemorating the event, and commanding
British subjects everywhere, who acknowledge the honor of Brunswick, to
rejoice, and give thanks to God for safely ushering into existence
George William Frederic, heir presumptive of the united crowns of Great
Britain and Ireland.Just twenty-two years afterward that child ascended
the throne of his ancestors as King George the Third.Let us now turn our eyes to the Western Continent, and contemplate a
scene of similar import, but under circumstances of a totally different
character.It is the 22d February, 1732.The locality is a distant
colony, the spot the verge of an immense, untrodden and unexplored
wilderness, the habitation a log cabin, with its chinks filled in with
clay, and its sloping roof patched over with clapboards.Snow covers the
ground, and a chill wintery wind is drifting the flakes, and moaning
through the forest.Two immense chimneys stand at either end of the
house, and give promise of cheerful comfort and primitive hospitality
within, totally in contrast with external nature.There are but four
small rooms in the dwelling, in one of which Mary Ball, the wife of
Augustine Washington, has just given birth to a son.No dukes or
marquises or earls are there to attest the humble event.There are no
princes of the blood to wrap the infant in the insignia of royalty, and
fold about his limbs the tapestried escutcheon of a kingdom.His first
breath is not drawn in the center of a mighty capitol, the air laden
with perfume, and trembling to the tones of soft music and the "murmurs
of low fountains."But the child is received from its Mother's womb by
hands imbrowned with honest labor, and laid upon a lowly couch,
indicative only of a backwoodsman's home and an American's inheritance.He, too, is christened George, and forty-three years afterward took
command of the American forces assembled on the plains of old Cambridge.But if their births were dissimilar, their rearing and education were
still more unlike.From his earliest recollection the Prince heard only
the language of flattery, moved about from palace to palace, just as
caprice dictated, slept upon the cygnet's down, and grew up in
indolence, self-will and vanity, a dictator from his cradle.The peasant
boy, on the other hand, was taught from his infancy that labor was
honorable, and hardships indispensable to vigorous health.He early
learned to sleep alone amid the dangers of a boundless wilderness, a
stone for his pillow, and the naked sod his bed; whilst the voices of
untamed nature around him sang his morning and his evening hymns.Truth,
courage and constancy were early implanted in his mind by a mother's
counsels, and the important lesson of life was taught by a father's
example, that when existence ceases to be useful it ceases to be happy.Early manhood ushered them both into active life; the one as king over
extensive dominions, the other as a modest, careful, and honest district
surveyor.Having traced the two Georges to the threshold of their career, let us
now proceed one step further, and take note of the first great public
event in the lives of either.For a long time preceding the year 1753 the French had laid claim to all
the North American continent west of the Alleghany Mountains, stretching
in an unbroken line from Canada to Louisiana.The English strenuously
denied this right, and when the French commandant on the Ohio, in 1753,
commenced erecting a fort near where the present city of Pittsburg
stands, and proceeded to capture certain English traders, and expel them
from the country, Dinwiddie, Governor of Virginia, deemed it necessary
to dispatch an agent on a diplomatic visit to the French commandant, and
demand by what authority he acted, by what title he claimed the country,
and order him immediately to evacuate the territory.George Washington, then only in his twenty-second year, was selected by
the Governor for this important mission.It is unnecessary to follow him, in all his perils, during his wintery
march through the wilderness.The historian of his life has painted in
imperishable colors his courage, his sagacity, his wonderful coolness in
the midst of danger, and the success which crowned his undertaking.The
memory loves to follow him through the trackless wilds of the forest,
accompanied by only a single companion, and making his way through
wintery snows, in the midst of hostile savages and wild beasts for more
than five hundred miles, to the residence of the French commander.How
often do we not shudder, as we behold the treacherous Indian guide, on
his return, deliberately raising his rifle, and leveling it at that
majestic form; thus endeavoring, by an act of treachery and cowardice,
to deprive Virginia of her young hero!with what fervent prayers
do we not implore a kind Providence to watch over his desperate
encounter with the floating ice, at midnight, in the swollen torrent of
the Alleghany, and rescue him from the wave and the storm.Standing
bareheaded on the frail raft, whilst in the act of dashing aside some
floating ice that threatened to ingulf him, the treacherous oar was
broken in his hand, and he is precipitated many feet into the boiling
current.for the destinies of millions yet
unborn hang upon that noble arm!In the early part of the year 1764 a
ministerial crisis occurs in England, and Lord Bute, the favorite of the
British monarch, is driven from the administration of the government.The troubles with the American colonists have also just commenced to
excite attention, and the young King grows angry, perplexed, and greatly
irritated.A few days after this, a rumor starts into circulation that
the monarch is sick.His attendants look gloomy, his friends terrified,
and even his physicians exhibit symptoms of doubt and danger.Yet he has
no fever, and is daily observed walking with uncertain and agitated step
along the corridors of the palace.His conduct becomes gradually more
and more strange, until doubt gives place to certainty, and the royal
medical staff report to a select committee of the House of Commons that
the King is threatened with _insanity_.For six weeks the cloud obscures
his mental faculties, depriving him of all interference with the
administration of the government, and betokening a sad disaster in the
future.His reason is finally restored, but frequent fits of passion,
pride and obstinacy indicate but too surely that the disease is seated,
and a radical cure impossible.Possessed now of the chief characteristics of George Washington and
George Guelph, we are prepared to review briefly their conduct during
the struggle that ensued between the two countries they respectively
represented.Let us now refer to the first act of disloyalty of Washington, the first
indignant spurn his high-toned spirit evinced under the oppressions of a
king.Not long after his return from the west, Washington was offered the
chief command of the forces about to be raised in Virginia, to expel the
French; but, with his usual modesty, he declined the appointment, on
account of his extreme youth, but consented to take the post of
lieutenant-colonel.Shortly afterward, on the death of Colonel Fry, he
was promoted to the chief command, but through no solicitations of his
own.Subsequently, when the war between France and England broke out in
Europe, the principal seat of hostilities was transferred to America,
and his Gracious Majesty George III sent over a large body of troops,
_under the command of favorite officers_.An
edict soon followed, denominated an "Order to settle the rank of the
officers of His Majesty's forces serving in America."By one of the
articles of this order, it was provided "that all officers commissioned
by the King, should take precedence of those of the same grade
commissioned by the governors of the respective colonies, although their
commissions might be of junior date;" and it was further provided, that
"when the troops served together, the provincial officers should enjoy
no rank at all."This order was scarcely promulgated--indeed, before the
ink was dry--ere the Governor of Virginia received a communication
informing him that _George Washington was no longer a soldier_.Entreaties, exhortations, and threats were all lavished upon him in
vain; and to those who, in their expostulations, spoke of the
defenseless frontiers of his native State, he patriotically but nobly
replied: "I will serve my country when I can do so without dishonor."In contrast with this attitude of Washington, look at the conduct of
George the Third respecting the colonies, after the passage of the Stamp
Act.This act was no sooner proclaimed in America, than the most violent
opposition was manifested, and combinations for the purpose of effectual
resistance were rapidly organized from Massachusetts to Georgia.The
leading English patriots, among whom were Burke and Barre, protested
against the folly of forcing the colonies into rebellion, and the city
of London presented a petition to the King, praying him to dismiss the
Granville ministry, and repeal the obnoxious act."It is with the utmost
astonishment," replied the King, "that I find any of my subjects capable
of encouraging the rebellious disposition that unhappily exists in some
of my North American colonies.Having entire confidence in the wisdom of
my parliament, the great council of the realm, I will steadily pursue
those measures which they have recommended for the support of the
constitutional rights of Great Britain."He heeded not the memorable
words of Burke, that afterward became prophetic."There are moments,"
exclaimed this great statesman, "critical moments in the fortunes of all
states when they who are too weak to contribute to your prosperity may
yet be strong enough to complete your ruin."The Boston port bill
passed, and the first blood was spilt at Lexington.It is enough to say of the long and bloody war that followed, that
George the Third, by his obstinacy, contributed more than any other man
in his dominion to prolong the struggle, and affix to it the stigma of
cruelty, inhumanity and vengeance; whilst Washington was equally the
soul of the conflict on the other side, and by his imperturbable
justice, moderation and firmness, did more than by his arms to convince
England that her revolted colonists were invincible.It is unnecessary to review in detail the old Revolution.Let us pass to
the social position of the two Georges in after-life.On the 2d August, 1786, as the King was alighting from his carriage at
the gate of St.James, an attempt was made on his life by a woman named
Margaret Nicholson, who, under pretense of presenting a petition,
endeavored to stab him with a knife which was concealed in the paper.The weapon was an old one, and so rusty that, on striking the vest of
the King, it bent double, and thus preserved his life.On the 29th
October, 1795, whilst his majesty was proceeding to the House of Lords,
a ball passed through both windows of the carriage.James the mob threw stones into the carriage, several of which struck
the King, and one lodged in the cuff of his coat.The state carriage was
completely demolished by the mob.But it was on the 15th May, 1800, that
George the Third made his narrowest escapes.In the morning of that
day, whilst attending the field exercise of a battalion of guards, one
of the soldiers loaded his piece with a bullet and discharged it at the
King.The ball fortunately missed its aim, and lodged in the thigh of a
gentleman who was standing in the rear.In the evening of the same day a
more alarming circumstance occurred at the Drury Lane Theatre.At the
moment when the King entered the royal box, a man in the pit, on the
right-hand side of the orchestra, suddenly stood up and discharged a
large horse-pistol at him.The hand of the would-be assassin was thrown
up by a bystander, and the ball entered the box just above the head of
the King.Such were the public manifestations of affection for this royal tyrant.He was finally attacked by an enemy that could not be thwarted, and on
the 20th December, 1810, he became a confirmed lunatic.In this dreadful
condition he lingered until January, 1820, when he died, having been the
most unpopular, unwise and obstinate sovereign that ever disgraced the
English throne.He was forgotten as soon as life left his body, and was
hurriedly buried with that empty pomp which but too often attends a
despot to the grave.His whole career is well summed up by Allan Cunningham, his biographer,
in few words: "Throughout his life he manifested a strong disposition to
be his own minister, and occasionally placed the kingly prerogatives in
perilous opposition to the resolutions of the nation's representatives.His interference with the deliberations of the upper house, as in the
case of Fox's Indian bill, was equally ill-judged and dangerous._The
separation of America from the mother country, at the time it took
place, was the result of the King's personal feelings and interference
with the ministry._ The war with France was, in part at least,
attributable to the views and wishes of the sovereign of England.His
obstinate refusal to grant any concessions to his Catholic subjects,
kept his cabinet perpetually hanging on the brink of dissolution, and
threatened the dismemberment of the kingdom.He has been often praised
for firmness, but it was in too many instances the firmness of
obstinacy; a dogged adherence to an opinion once pronounced, or a
resolution once formed."The mind, in passing from the unhonored grave of the prince to the last
resting-place of the peasant boy, leaps from a kingdom of darkness to
one of light.Let us now return to the career of Washington.Throughout the
Revolutionary War he carried, like Atropos, in his hand the destinies of
millions; he bore, like Atlas, on his shoulders the weight of a world.It is unnecessary to follow him throughout his subsequent career.Honored again and again by the people of the land he had redeemed from
thraldom, he has taken his place in death by the side of the wisest and
best of the world's benefactors.Assassins did not unglory him in life,
nor has oblivion drawn her mantle over him in death.The names of his
great battle-fields have become nursery words, and his principles have
imbedded themselves forever in the national character.Every pulsation
of our hearts beats true to his memory.His mementoes are everywhere
around and about us.Distant as we are from the green fields of his
native Westmoreland, the circle of his renown has spread far beyond our
borders.In climes where the torch of science was never kindled; on
shores still buried in primeval bloom; amongst barbarians where the face
of liberty was never seen, the Christian missionary of America, roused
perhaps from his holy duties by the distant echo of the national salute,
this day thundering amidst the billows of every sea, or dazzled by the
gleam of his country's banner, this day floating in every wind of
heaven, pauses over his task as a Christian, and whilst memory kindles
in his bosom the fires of patriotism, pronounced in the ear of the
enslaved pagan the venerated name of WASHINGTON!Nor are the sons of the companions of Washington alone in doing justice
to his memory.Our sisters, wives and mothers compete with us in
discharging this debt of national gratitude.With a delicacy that none
but woman could exhibit, and with a devotion that none but a daughter
could feel, they are now busy in executing the noble scheme of
purchasing his tomb, in order for endless generations to stand sentinel
over his remains.ye daughters
of America; enfold them closer to your bosom than your first-born
offspring; build around them a mausoleum that neither time nor change
can overthrow; for within them germinates the seeds of liberty for the
benefit of millions yet unborn.Wherever tyranny shall lift its Medusan
head, wherever treason shall plot its hellish schemes, wherever disunion
shall unfurl its tattered ensign, there, oh there, sow them in the
hearts of patriots and republicans!For from these pale ashes there
shall spring, as from the dragon's teeth sown by Cadmus of old on the
plains of Heber, vast armies of invincible heroes, sworn upon the altar
and tomb at Mount Vernon, to live as freemen, or as such to die!_MASONRY._


    Oh, sacred spirit of Masonic love,
    Offspring of Heaven, the angels' bond above,
    Guardian of peace and every social tie,
    How deep the sources of thy fountains lie!How wide the realms that 'neath thy wings expand,
    Embracing every clime, encircling every land!Beneath the aurora of the Polar skies,
    Where Greenland's everlasting glaciers rise,
    The Lodge mysterious lifts its snow-built dome,
    And points the brother to a sunnier home;
    Where Nilus slays the sacrificial kid,
    Beneath the shadow of her pyramid,
    Where magian suns unclasp the gaping ground,
    And far Australia's golden sands abound;
    Where breakers thunder on the coral strand,
    To guard the gates of Kamehameha's land;
    Wherever man, in lambskin garb arrayed,
    Strikes in defense of innocence betrayed;
    Lifts the broad shield of charity to all,
    And bends in anguish o'er a brother's fall;
    Where the bright symbol of Masonic truth,
    Alike for high and low, for age or youth,
    Flames like yon sun at tropic midday's call,
    And opes the universal eye on all!What though in secret all your alms be done,
    Your foes all vanquished and your trophies won?What though a veil be o'er your Lodges thrown,
    And brother only be to brother known?In secret, God built up the rolling world;
    In secret, morning's banners are unfurled;
    In secret, spreads the leaf, unfolds the flower,
    Revolve the spheres, and speeds the passing hour.The day is noise, confusion, strife, turmoil,
    Struggles for bread, and sweat beneath the toil.The night is silence--progress without jars,
    The rest of mortals and the march of stars!The day for work to toiling man was given;
    But night, to lead his erring steps to Heaven.Who feed the hungry, heed the orphan's cry;
    Who clothe the naked, dry the widow's tear,
    Befriend the exile, bear the stranger's bier;
    Stand round the bedside when the fluttering soul
    Bursts her clay bonds and parteth for her goal;
    God speed you in the noble path you tread,
    Friends of the living, mourners o'er the dead.May all your actions, measured on the square,
    Be just and righteous, merciful and fair;
    Your thoughts flow pure, in modesty of mind,
    Along the equal level of mankind;
    Your words be troweled to truth's perfect tone,
    Your fame be chiseled in unblemished stone,
    Your hearts be modeled on the plummet's line,
    Your faith be guided by the Book divine;
    And when at last the gavel's beat above
    Calls you from labor to the feast of love,
    May mighty Boaz, pillar'd at that gate
    Which seraphs tyle and where archangels wait,
    Unloose the bandage from your dazzled eyes,
    Spell out the _Password_ to Arch-Royal skies;
    Upon your bosom set the signet steel,
    Help's sign disclose, and Friendship's grip reveal;
    Place in your grasp the soul's unerring rod,
    And light you to the Temple of your God!_POLLOCK'S EUTHANASIA._


    He is gone!By his own strong pinions lifted
                      To the stars;

    Where he strikes, with minstrels olden,
    Choral harps, whose strings are golden,
                      Deathless bars.There, with Homer's ghost all hoary,
    Not with years, but fadeless glory,
                      Lo!he stands;

    And through that open portal,
    We behold the bards immortal
                      Clasping hands!how Rome's great epic master
    Sings, that death is no disaster
                      To the wise;

    Fame on earth is but a menial,
    But it reigns a king perennial
                      In the skies!Albion's blind old bard heroic,
    Statesman, sage, and Christian stoic,
                      Greets his son;

    Whilst in paeans wild and glorious,
    Like his "Paradise victorious,"
                      Sings, Well done!a bard with forehead pendent,
    But with glory's beams resplendent
                      As a star;

    Slow descends from regions higher,
    With a crown and golden lyre
                      In his car.All around him, crowd as minions,
    Thrones and sceptres, and dominions,
                      Kings and Queens;

    Ages past and ages present,
    Lord and dame, and prince and peasant,
                      His demesnes!young bard hesperian,
    Welcome to the heights empyrean,
                      Thou did'st sing,

    Ere yet thy trembling fingers
    Struck where fame immortal lingers,
                      In the string.I am the bard of Avon,
    And the Realm of song in Heaven
                      Is my own;

    Long thy verse shall live in story,
    And thy Lyre I crown with glory,
                      And a throne!_SCIENCE, LITERATURE AND ART DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH
CENTURY._


Looking back into the past, and exploring by the light of authentic
history, sacred as well as profane, the characteristics of former ages,
the merest tyro in learning cannot fail to perceive that certain epochs
stand prominently out on the "sands of time," and indicate vast activity
and uncommon power in the human mind.These epochs are so well marked that history has given them a
designation, and to call them by their name, conjures up, as by the wand
of an enchanter, the heroic representatives of our race.If, for instance, we should speak of the era of Solomon, in sacred
history, the memory would instantly picture forth the pinnacles of the
Holy Temple, lifting themselves into the clouds; the ear would listen
intently to catch the sweet intonations of the harp of David, vocal at
once with the prophetic sorrows of his race, and swelling into sublime
ecstasy at the final redemption of his people; the eye would glisten at
the pomp and pageantry of the foreign potentates who thronged his court,
and gloat with rapture over the beauty of the young Queen of Sheba, who
journeyed from a distant land to seek wisdom at the feet of the wisest
monarch that ever sat upon a throne.We should behold his ships
traversing every sea, and pouring into the lap of Israel the gold of
Ophir, the ivory of Senegambia, and the silks, myrrh, and spices of the
East.So, too, has profane history its golden ages, when men all seemed to be
giants, and their minds inspired.What is meant when we speak of the age of Pericles?We mean all that is
glorious in the annals of Greece.We mean Apelles with his pencil,
Phidias with his chisel, Alcibiades with his sword.We seem to be
strolling arm-in-arm with Plato, into the academy, to listen to the
divine teachings of Socrates, or hurrying along with the crowd toward
the theatre, where Herodotus is reading his history, or Euripides is
presenting his tragedies.Aspasia rises up like a beautiful apparition
before us, and we follow willing slaves at the wheels of her victorious
chariot.The whole of the Peloponnesus glows with intellect like a forge
in blast, and scatters the trophies of Grecian civilization profusely
around us.The Parthenon lifts its everlasting columns, and the Venus
and Apollo are moulded into marble immortality.Rome had her Augustan age, an era of poets, philosophers, soldiers,
statesmen, and orators.Crowded into contemporary life, we recognize the
greatest general of the heathen world, the greatest poet, the greatest
orator, and the greatest statesman of Rome.Caesar and Cicero, Virgil and
Octavius, all trod the pavement of the capitol together, and lent their
blended glory to immortalize the Augustan age.Italy and Spain and France and England have had their golden age.The
eras of Lorenzo the Magnificent, of Ferdinand and Isabella, of Louis
Quatorze and of Elizabeth, can never be forgotten.They loom up from the
surrounding gloom like the full moon bursting upon the sleeping seas;
irradiating the night, clothing the meanest wave in sparkling silver,
and dimming the lustre of the brightest stars.History has also left in
its track mementoes of a different character.In sacred history we have
the age of Herod; in profane, the age of Nero.We recognize at a glance
the talismanic touch of the age of chivalry, and the era of the
Crusades, and mope our way in darkness and gloom along that opaque
track, stretching from the reign of Justinian, in the sixth century, to
the reign of Edward the Third, in the fourteenth, and known throughout
Christendom as the "Dark Ages."Let us now take a survey of the field we
occupy, and ascertain, if possible, the category in which our age shall
be ranked by our posterity.But before proceeding to discuss the characteristics of our epoch, let
us define more especially what that epoch embraces.It does not embrace the American nor the French Revolution, nor does it
include the acts or heroes of either.The impetus given to the human
mind by the last half of the eighteenth century, must be carefully
distinguished from the impulses of the first half of the nineteenth.The
first was an era of almost universal war, the last of almost
uninterrupted peace.The dying ground-swell of the waves after a storm
belong to the tempest, not to the calm which succeeds.Hence the wars of
Napoleon, the literature and art of his epoch, must be excluded from
observation, in properly discussing the true characteristics of our era.De Stael and Goethe and Schiller and Byron; Pitt and Nesselrode,
Metternich and Hamilton; Fichte and Stewart and Brown and Cousin;
Canova, Thorwaldsen and La Place, though all dying since the beginning
of this century, belong essentially to a former era.They were the
ripened fruits of that grand uprising of the human mind which first
took form on the 4th day of July, 1776.Our era properly commences with
the downfall of the first Napoleon, and none of the events connected
therewith, either before or afterward, can be philosophically classed in
the epoch we represent, but must be referred to a former period.Ages
hence, then, the philosophic critic will thus describe the first half of
the nineteenth century:

  "The normal state of Christendom was peace.The age of steel that
  immediately went before it had passed."Speculative philosophy fell asleep; literature declined;
  Skepticism bore sway in religion, politics, and morals; Utility
  became the universal standard of right and wrong, and the truths
  of every science and the axioms of every art were ruthlessly
  subjected to the _experimentum crucis_.The verdicts pronounced in the olden time against
  Mohammed and Mesmer and Robespierre were set aside, and a new
  trial granted.The ghosts of Roger Bacon and Emanuel Swedenborg
  were summoned from the Stygian shore to plead their causes anew
  before the bar of public opinion.The head of Oliver Cromwell was
  ordered down from the gibbet, the hump was smoothed down on the
  back of Richard III, and the sentence pronounced by Urban VIII
  against the'starry Galileo' reversed forever.Aristotle was
  decently interred beneath a modern monument inscribed thus: '_In
  pace requiescat_;' whilst Francis Bacon was rescued from the
  sacrilegious hands of kings and peers and parliament, and
  canonized by the unanimous consent of Christendom.Germany led the van, and
  Humboldt became the impersonation of his times."Such unquestionably will be the verdict of the future, when the present
time, with all its treasures and trash, its hopes and realizations,
shall have been safely shelved and labeled amongst the musty records of
bygone generations.Let us now examine into the grounds of this verdict more minutely, and
test its accuracy by exemplifications.I. And first, who believes now in _innate ideas_?Locke has been
completely superseded by the materialists of Germany and France, and all
speculative moral philosophy exploded.The audiences of Edinburgh and
Brown University interrupt Sir William Hamilton and Dr.Wayland in their
discourses, and, stripping off the plumage from their theses,
inquisitively demand, "_Cui bono_?"How can
we apply it to the every-day concerns of life?We ask you for bread and
you have given us a stone; and though that stone be a diamond, it is
valueless, except for its glitter.No philosopher can speculate
successfully or even satisfactorily to himself, when he is met at every
turn by some vulgar intruder into the domains of Aristotle and Kant, who
clips his wings just as he was prepared to soar into the heavens, by an
offer of copartnership to "speculate," it may be, in the price of pork.Hence, no moral philosopher of our day has been enabled to erect any
theory which will stand the assaults of logic for a moment.Each school
rises for an instant to the surface, and sports out its little day in
toss and tribulation, until the next wave rolls along, with foam on its
crest and fury in its roar, and overwhelms it forever.As with its
predecessor, so with itself."The eternal surge
    Of Time and Tide rolls on and bears afar
    Their bubbles: as the old burst, new emerge,
    Lashed from the foam of ages."But I have stated that this is an age of _literary decline_.It is
true that more books are written and published, more newspapers and
periodicals printed and circulated, more extensive libraries collected
and incorporated, and more ink indiscriminately spilt, than at any
former period of the world's history.In looking about us we are
forcibly reminded of the sarcastic couplet of Pope, who complains--

    "That those who cannot write, and those who can,
     All scratch, all scrawl, and scribble to a man."Had a modern gentleman all the eyes of Argus, all the hands of Briareus,
all the wealth of Croesus, and lived to the age of Methuselah, his
eyes would all fail, his fingers all tire, his money all give out, and
his years come to an end, long before he perused one tenth of the annual
product of the press of Christendom at the present day.It is no figure
of rhetoric to say that the press groans beneath the burden of its
labors.Could the types of Leipsic and London, Paris and New York, speak
out, the Litany would have to be amended, and a new article added, to
which they would solemnly respond: "Spare us, good Lord!"A recent publication furnishes the following statistical facts relating
to the book trade in our own country: "Books have multiplied to such an
extent in the United States that it now takes 750 paper-mills, with 2000
engines in constant operation, to supply the printers, who work day and
night, endeavoring to keep their engagements with publishers.These
tireless mills produce 270,000,000 pounds of paper every year.It
requires a pound and a quarter of old rags for one pound of paper, thus
340,000,000 pounds of rags were consumed in this way last year.There
are about 300 publishers in the United States, and near 10,000
book-sellers who are engaged in the task of dispensing literary pabulum
to the public."It may appear somewhat paradoxical to assert that literature is
declining whilst books and authors are multiplying to such a fearful
extent.Byron wrote:

    "'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print;
     A book's a book, although there's nothing in 't."True enough; but books are not always literature.A man may become an
author without ceasing to be an ignoramus.His name may adorn a
title-page without being recorded _in aere perenne_.He may attempt to
write himself up a very "lion" in literature, whilst good master Slender
may be busily engaged "in writing him down an ass."Not one book in a thousand is a success; not one success in ten thousand
wreathes the fortunate author with the laurel crown, and lifts him up
into the region of the immortals.Tell me, ye who prate about the
_literary glory_ of the nineteenth century, wherein it consists?Whose
are

    "The great, the immortal names
     That were not born to die?"I cast my eyes up the long vista toward the Temple of Fame, and I behold
hundreds of thousands pressing on to reach the shining portals.They
jostle each other by the way, they trip, they fall, they are overthrown
and ruthlessly trampled into oblivion, by the giddy throng, as they rush
onward and upward.One, it may be two, of the million who started out,
stand trembling at the threshold, and with exultant voices cry aloud for
admittance.One perishes before the summons can be answered; and the
other, awed into immortality by the august presence into which he
enters, is transformed into imperishable stone.Let us carefully scan the rolls of the literature of our era, and
select, if we can, poet, orator, or philosopher, whose fame will deepen
as it runs, and brighten as it burns, until future generations shall
drink at the fountain and be refreshed, and kindle their souls at the
vestal flame and be purified, illuminated and ennobled.In poetry, aye, in the crowded realms of song, who bears the
sceptre?--who wears the crown?America, England, France and Germany can
boast of bards _by the gross_, and rhyme _by the acre_, but not a single
poet.The _poeta nascitur_ is not here.He may be on his way--and I have
heard that he was--but this generation must pass before he arrives.Is it Poe, croaking sorrowfully with
his "Raven," or Willis, cooing sweetly with his "Dove"?Is it Bryant,
with his "Thanatopsis," or Prentice, with his "Dirge to the Dead Year"?Perhaps it is Holmes, with his "Lyrics," or Longfellow, with his
"Idyls."is it not self-evident that we have no poet, when it is
utterly impossible to discover any two critics in the land who can find
him?True, we have lightning-bugs enough, but no star; foot-hills, it may be,
in abundance, but no Mount Shasta, with its base built upon the
everlasting granite, and its brow bathed in the eternal sunlight.In England, Tennyson, the Laureate, is the spokesman of a clique, the
pet poet of a princely circle, whose rhymes flow with the docility and
harmony of a limpid brook, but never stun like Niagara, nor rise into
sublimity like the storm-swept sea.Beranger, the greatest poet of France of our era, was a mere
song-writer; and Heine, the pride of young Germany, a mere satirist and
lyrist.Freiligrath can never rank with Goethe or Schiller; and Victor
Hugo never attain the heights trodden by Racine, Corneille, or Boileau.In oratory, where shall we find the compeer of Chatham or Mirabeau,
Burke or Patrick Henry?I have not forgotten Peel and Gladstone, nor
Lamartine and Count Cavour, nor Sargent S. Prentiss and Daniel Webster.But Webster himself, by far the greatest intellect of all these, was a
mere debater, and the spokesman of a party.He was an eloquent speaker,
but can never rank as an orator with the rhetoricians of the last
century.And in philosophy and general learning, where shall we find the equal of
that burly old bully, Dr.and yet Johnson, with all his
learning, was a third-rate philosopher.In truth, the greatest author of our era was a mere essayist.Beyond all
controversy, Thomas Babington Macaulay was the most polished writer of
our times.With an intellect acute, logical and analytic; with an
imagination glowing and rich, but subdued and under perfect control;
with a style so clear and limpid and concise, that it has become a
standard for all who aim to follow in the path he trod, and with a
learning so full and exact, and exhaustive, that he was nicknamed, when
an undergraduate, the "Omniscient Macaulay;" he still lacks the giant
grasp of thought, the bold originality, and the intense, earnest
enthusiasm which characterize the master-spirits of the race, and
identify them with the eras they adorn.As in literature, so in what have been denominated by scholars the
_Fine Arts_.The past fifty years has not produced a painter, sculptor,
or composer, who ranks above mediocrity in their respective vocations.Canova and Thorwaldsen were the last of their race; Sir Joshua
Reynolds left no successor, and the immortal Beethoven has been
superseded by <DW64> minstrelsy and senseless pantomime.The greatest
architect of the age is a railroad contractor, and the first dramatist a
cobbler of French farces.But whilst the highest faculty of the mind--the imagination--has
been left uncultivated, and has produced no worthy fruit, the next
highest, the casual, or the one that deals with causes and effects, has
been stimulated into the most astonishing fertility.Our age ignores fancy, and deals exclusively with fact.Within its
chosen range it stands far, very far pre-eminent over all that have
preceded it.It reaps the fruit of Bacon's labors.It stands thoughtfully on the field of Waterloo, and
estimates scientifically the manuring properties of bones and blood.It
disentombs the mummy of Thotmes II, sells the linen bandages for the
manufacture of paper, burns the asphaltum-soaked body for firewood, and
plants the pint of red wheat found in his sarcophagus, to try an
agricultural experiment.It deals in no sentimentalities; it has no
appreciation of the sublime.It stands upon the ocean shore, but with
its eyes fixed on the yellow sand searching for gold.It confronts
Niagara, and, gazing with rapture at its misty shroud, exclaims, in an
ecstasy of admiration, "Lord, what a place to sponge a coat!"Having no
soul to save, it has no religion to save it.It has discovered that
Mohammed was a great benefactor of his race, and that Jesus Christ was,
after all, a mere man; distinguished, it is true, for his benevolence,
his fortitude and his morality, but for nothing else.It does not
believe in the Pope, nor in the Church, nor in the Bible.It ridicules
the infallibility of the first, the despotism of the second, and the
chronology of the third.It is possessed of the very spirit of Thomas;
it must "touch and handle" before it will believe.It questions the
existence of spirit, because it cannot be analyzed by chemical solvents;
it questions the existence of hell, because it has never been scorched;
it questions the existence of God, because it has never beheld Him.It does, however, believe in the explosive force of gunpowder, in the
evaporation of boiling water, in the head of the magnet, and in the
heels of the lightnings.It conjugates the Latin verb _invenio_ (to find
out) through all its voices, moods and tenses.It invents everything;
from a lucifer match in the morning to kindle a kitchen fire, up through
all the intermediate ranks and tiers and grades of life, to a telescope
that spans the heavens in the evening, it recognizes no chasm or hiatus
in its inventions.It sinks an artesian well in the desert of Sahara for
a pitcher of water, and bores through the Alleghanies for a hogshead of
oil.From a fish-hook to the Great Eastern, from a pocket deringer to a
columbiad, from a sewing machine to a Victoria suspension bridge, it
oscillates like a pendulum.Deficient in literature and art, our age surpasses all others in
science.Knowledge has become the great end and aim of human life."I
want to know," is inscribed as legibly on the hammer of the geologist,
the crucible of the chemist, and the equatorial of the astronomer, as it
is upon the phiz of a regular "Down-Easter."Our age has inherited the
chief failing of our first mother, and passing by the "Tree of Life in
the midst of the Garden," we are all busily engaged in mercilessly
plundering the Tree of Knowledge of all its fruit.The time is rapidly
approaching when no man will be considered a gentleman who has not filed
his _caveat_ in the Patent Office.The inevitable result of this spirit of the age begins already to be
seen.The philosophy of a cold, blank, calculating materialism has taken
possession of all the avenues of learning.Epicurus is worshiped instead
of Christ.Mammon is considered as the only true savior._Dum Vivimus
Vivamus_, is the maxim we live by, and the creed we die by.Peter has
surrendered his keys to that great incarnate representative of this age,

XXIV._THE ENROBING OF LIBERTY._


    The war-drum was silent, the cannon was mute,
      The sword in its scabbard lay still,
    And battle had gathered the last autumn fruit
      That crimson-dyed river and rill,
    When a Goddess came down from her mansion on high,
      To gladden the world with her smile,
    Leaving only her robes in the realm of the sky,
      That their sheen might no mortal beguile.As she lit on the earth she was welcomed by Peace,
      Twin sisters in Eden of yore--
    But parted forever when fetter-bound Greece
      Drove her exiled and chained from her shore;
    Never since had the angel of Liberty trod
      In virginal beauty below;
    But, chased from the earth, she had mounted to God,
      Despoiled of her raiment of snow.Our sires gathered round her, entranced by her smile,
      Remembering the footprints of old
    She had graven on grottoes, in Scio's sweet Isle,
      Ere the doom of fair Athens was told."I am naked," she cried; "I am homeless on earth;
      Kings, Princes, and Lords are my foes,
    But I stand undismayed, though an orphan by birth,
      And condemned to the region of snows."hail"--our fathers exclaim--
      "To the glorious land of the West!With a diadem bright we will honor thy name,
      And enthrone thee America's guest;
    We will found a great nation and call it thine own,
      And erect here an altar to thee,
    Where millions shall kneel at the foot of thy throne
      And swear to forever be free!"Then each brought a vestment her form to enrobe,
      And screen her fair face from the sun,
    And thus she stood forth as the Queen of the globe
      When the work of our Fathers was done.A circlet of stars round her temples they wove,
      That gleamed like Orion's bright band,
    And an emblem of power, the eagle of Jove,
      They perched like a bolt in her hand;
    On her forehead, a scroll that contained but a line
      Was written in letters of light,
    That our great "Constitution" forever might shine,
      A sun to illumine the night.Her feet were incased in broad sandals of gold,
      That riches might spring in her train;
    While a warrior's casque, with its visor uproll'd,
      Protected her tresses and brain;
    Round her waist a bright girdle of satin was bound,
      Formed of colors so blended and true,
    That when as a banner the scarf was unwound,
      It floated the "Red, White and Blue."Then Liberty calm, leant on Washington's arm,
      And spoke in prophetical strain:
    "Columbia's proud hills I will shelter from ills,
      Whilst her valleys and mountains remain;
    But palsied the hand that would pillage the band
      Of sisterhood stars in my crown,
    And death to the knave whose sword would enslave,
      By striking your great charter down."Your eagle shall soar this western world o'er,
      And carry the sound of my name,
    Till monarchs shall quake and its confines forsake,
      If true to your ancestral fame!Your banner shall gleam like the polar star's beam,
      To guide through rebellion's Red sea,
    And in battle 'twill wave, both to conquer and save,
      If borne by the hands of the free!"[Decoration]

XXV._A CAKE OF SOAP._


    I stood at my washstand, one bright sunny morn,
    And gazed through the blinds at the upbringing corn,
    And mourn'd that my summers were passing away,
    Like the dew on the meadow that morning in May.I seized, for an instant, the Iris-hued soap,
    That glowed in the dish, like an emblem of hope,
    And said to myself, as I melted its snows,
    "The longer I use it, the lesser it grows."For life, in its morn, is full freighted and gay,
    And fair as the rainbow when clouds float away;
    Sweet-scented and useful, it sheds its perfume,
    Till wasted or blasted, it melts in the tomb.Thus day after day, whilst we lather and scrub,
    Time wasteth and blasteth with many a rub,
    Till thinner and thinner, the soap wears away,
    And age hands us over to dust and decay.as I dream of thee now,
    With the spice in thy breath, and the bloom on thy brow,
    To a cake of pure Lubin thy life I compare,
    So fragrant, so fragile, and so debonair!But fortune was fickle, and labor was vain,
    And want overtook us, with grief in its train,
    Till, worn out by troubles, death came in the blast;
    But _thy_ kisses, like Lubin's, were sweet to the last!_THE SUMMERFIELD CASE._


The following additional particulars, as sequel to the Summerfield
homicide, have been furnished by an Auburn correspondent:

  MR.EDITOR: The remarkable confession of the late Leonidas Parker,
  which appeared in your issue of the 13th ultimo, has given rise to
  a series of disturbances in this neighborhood, which, for romantic
  interest and downright depravity, have seldom been surpassed, even
  in California.Before proceeding to relate in detail the late
  transactions, allow me to remark that the wonderful narrative of
  Parker excited throughout this county sentiments of the most
  profound and contradictory character.I, for one, halted between
  two opinions--horror and incredulity; and nothing but subsequent
  events could have fully satisfied me of the unquestionable
  veracity of your San Francisco correspondent, and the scientific
  authenticity of the facts related.The doubt with which the story was at first received in this
  community--and which found utterance in a burlesque article in an
  obscure country journal, the Stars and Stripes, of Auburn--has
  finally been dispelled and we find ourselves forced to admit that
  we stand even now in the presence of the most alarming fate.Too
  much credit cannot be awarded to our worthy coroner for the
  promptitude of his action, and we trust that the Governor of the
  State will not be less efficient in the discharge of his duty.[Since the above letter was written the following proclamation has
  been issued.--P.PROCLAMATION OF THE GOVERNOR.=$10,000 REWARD!=

                                           DEPARTMENT OF STATE.By virtue of the authority in me vested, I do hereby offer the
    above reward of ten thousand dollars, in gold coin of the
    United States, for the Arrest of Bartholomew Graham,
    familiarly known as Black Bart.Said Graham is accused of the
    murder of C. P. Gillson, late of Auburn, county of Placer, on
    the 14th ultimo.He is five feet ten inches and a half in
    height, thick set, has a mustache sprinkled with gray,
    grizzled hair, clear blue eyes, walks stooping, and served in
    the late civil war under Price and Quantrell, in the
    Confederate army.He may be lurking in some of the
    mining-camps near the foot-hills, as he was a Washoe teamster
    during the Comstock excitement.The above reward will be paid
    for him, _dead or alive_, as he possessed himself of an
    important secret by robbing the body of the late Gregory
    Summerfield.By the Governor:                  H. G. NICHOLSON,
                                            Secretary of State.Given at Sacramento, this the fifth day of June, 1871.Our correspondent continues:

  I am sorry to say that Sheriff Higgins has not been so active in
  the discharge of his duty as the urgency of the case required, but
  he is perhaps excusable on account of the criminal interference of
  the editor above alluded to.But I am detaining you from more
  important matters.Your Saturday's paper reached here at 4
  o'clock, Saturday, 13th May, and, as it now appears from the
  evidence taken before the coroner, several persons left Auburn on
  the same errand, but without any previous conference.Two of these
  were named respectively Charles P. Gillson and Bartholomew Graham,
  or, as he was usually called, "Black Bart."Gillson kept a saloon
  at the corner of Prickly Ash Street and the Old Spring Road; and
  Black Bart was in the employ of Conrad & Co., keepers of the
  Norfolk livery stable.Gillson was a son-in-law of ex-Governor
  Roberts, of Iowa, and leaves a wife and two children to mourn his
  untimely end.As for Graham, nothing certain is known of his
  antecedents.It is said that he was engaged in the late robbery of
  Wells & Fargo's express at Grizzly Bend, and that he was an
  habitual gambler.Only one thing about him is certainly well
  known: he was a lieutenant in the Confederate army, and served
  under General Price and the outlaw Quantrell.He was a man
  originally of fine education, plausible manners and good family;
  but strong drink seems early in life to have overmastered him, and
  left him but a wreck of himself.But he was not incapable of
  generous, or rather, romantic, acts; for, during the burning of
  the Putnam House, in this town, last summer, he rescued two ladies
  from the flames.In so doing he scorched his left hand so
  seriously as to contract the tendons of two fingers, and this very
  scar may lead to his apprehension.There is no doubt about his
  utter desperation of character, and, if taken at all, it will
  probably be not alive.So much for the persons concerned in the tragedy at the Flat.Herewith I inclose copies of the testimony of the witnesses
  examined before the coroner's jury, together with the statement of
  Gillson, taken _in articulo mortis_:


                     DEPOSITION OF DOLLIE ADAMS.STATE OF CALIFORNIA, } ss.Said witness, being duly sworn, deposed as follows, to wit: My
    name is Dollie Adams; my age forty-seven years; I am the wife
    of Frank G. Adams, of this township, and reside on the North
    Fork of the American River, below Cape Horn, on Thompson's
    Flat; about one o'clock P. M., May 14, 1871, I left the cabin
    to gather wood to cook dinner for my husband and the hands at
    work for him on the claim; the trees are mostly cut away from
    the bottom, and I had to climb some distance up the mountain
    side before I could get enough to kindle the fire; I had gone
    about five hundred yards from the cabin, and was searching for
    small sticks of fallen timber, when I thought I heard some one
    groan, as if in pain; I paused and listened; the groaning
    became more distinct, and I started at once for the place
    whence the sounds proceeded; about ten steps off I discovered
    the man whose remains lie there (pointing to the deceased),
    sitting up, with his back against a big rock; he looked so
    pale that I thought him already dead, but he continued to moan
    until I reached his side; hearing me approach, he opened his
    eyes, and begged me, "For God's sake, give me a drop of
    water!"I asked him, "What is the matter?"He replied, "I am
    shot in the back."Without waiting to question him further, I returned
    to the cabin, told Zenie--my daughter--what I had seen, and
    sent her off on a run for the men.Taking with me a gourd of
    water, some milk and bread--for I thought the poor gentleman
    might be hungry and weak, as well as wounded--I hurried back
    to his side, where I remained until "father"--as we all call
    my husband--came with the men.We removed him as gently as we
    could to the cabin; then sent for Dr.Liebner, and nursed him
    until he died, yesterday, just at sunset.Question by the Coroner: Did you hear his statement, taken
    down by the Assistant District Attorney?--A.Q. Did you see him sign it?--A.Q. Is this your signature thereto as witness?--A.(Signed)                         DOLLIE ADAMS.DEPOSITION OF MISS X. V. ADAMS.Being first duly sworn, witness testified as follows: My name
    is Xixenia Volumnia Adams; I am the daughter of Frank G. Adams
    and the last witness; I reside with them on the Flat, and my
    age is eighteen years; a little past 1 o'clock on Sunday last
    my mother came running into the house and informed me that a
    man was dying from a wound, on the side-hill, and that I must
    go for father and the boys immediately.I ran as fast as my
    legs would carry me to where they were "cleaning up," for they
    never cleaned up week-days on the Flat, and told the news; we
    all came back together and proceeded to the spot where the
    wounded man lay weltering in his blood; he was cautiously
    removed to the cabin, where he lingered until yesterday
    sundown, when he died.A. He did
    frequently; at first with great pain, but afterward more
    audibly and intelligibly.A. First, to send for Squire Jacobs, the
    Assistant District Attorney, as he had a statement to make;
    and some time afterward, to send for his wife; but we first of
    all sent for the doctor.A. Only myself; he had
    appeared a great deal easier, and his wife had lain down to
    take a short nap, and my mother had gone to the spring and
    left me alone to watch; suddenly he lifted himself
    spasmodically in bed, glared around wildly and muttered
    something inaudible; seeing me, he cried out, "Run!or he'll set
    the world afire!His tone of voice
    gradually strengthened until the end of his raving; when he
    cried "fire!"his eyeballs glared, his mouth quivered, his
    body convulsed, and before Mrs.Gillson could reach his
    bedside he fell back stone dead.(Signed)                          X. V. ADAMS.The testimony of Adams corroborated in every particular that of
  his wife and daughter, but set forth more fully the particulars of
  his demoniac ravings.He would taste nothing from a glass or
  bottle, but shuddered whenever any article of that sort met his
  eyes.In fact, they had to remove from the room the cups,
  tumblers, and even the castors.At times he spoke rationally, but
  after the second day only in momentary flashes of sanity.The deposition of the attending physician, after giving the
  general facts with regard to the sickness of the patient and his
  subsequent demise, proceeded thus:


    I found the patient weak, and suffering from loss of blood and
    rest, and want of nourishment; occasionally sane, but for the
    most part flighty and in a comatose condition.The wound was
    an ordinary gunshot wound, produced most probably by the ball
    of a navy revolver, fired at the distance of ten paces.It
    entered the back near the left clavicle, beneath the scapula,
    close to the vertebrae between the intercostal spaces of the
    fifth and sixth ribs; grazing the pericardium it traversed the
    mediastinum, barely touching the oesophagus, and vena azygos,
    but completely severing the thoracic duct, and lodging in the
    xiphoid portion of the sternum.Necessarily fatal, there was
    no reason, however, why the patient could not linger for a
    week or more; but it is no less certain that from the effect
    of the wound he ultimately died.I witnessed the execution of
    the paper shown to me--as the statement of deceased--at his
    request; and at the time of signing the same he was in his
    perfect senses.It was taken down in my presence by Jacobs,
    the Assistant District Attorney of Placer County, and read
    over to the deceased before he affixed his signature.I was
    not present when he breathed his last, having been called away
    by my patients in the town of Auburn, but I reached his
    bedside shortly afterward.In my judgment, no amount of care
    or medical attention could have prolonged his life more than a
    few days.(Signed)                   KARL LIEBNER, M. D.


  The statement of the deceased was then introduced to the jury as
  follows:


    PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA }
                  _vs._               }
            BARTHOLOMEW GRAHAM.       }_Statement and Dying Confession of Charles P. Gillson, taken
    in articulo mortis by George Simpson, Notary Public._

    On the morning of Sunday, the 14th day of May, 1871, I left
    Auburn alone in search of the body of the late Gregory
    Summerfield, who was reported to have been pushed from the
    cars at Cape Horn, in this county, by one Leonidas Parker,
    since deceased.It was not fully light when I reached the
    track of the Central Pacific Railroad.Having mined at an
    early day on Thompson's Flat, at the foot of the rocky
    promontory now called Cape Horn, I was familiar with the
    zigzag paths leading down that steep precipice.One was
    generally used as a descent, the other as an ascent from the
    canyon below.I chose the latter, as being the freest from the
    chance of observation.It required the greatest caution to
    thread the narrow gorge; but I finally reached the rocky
    bench, about one thousand feet below the grade of the
    railroad.It was now broad daylight, and I commenced
    cautiously the search for Summerfield's body.There is quite a
    dense undergrowth of shrubs thereabouts, lining the
    interstices of the granite rocks so as to obscure the vision
    even at a short distance.Brushing aside a thick manzanita
    bush, I beheld the dead man at the same instant of time that
    another person arrived like an apparition upon the spot.It
    was Bartholomew Graham, known as "Black Bart."We suddenly
    confronted each other, the skeleton of Summerfield lying
    exactly between us.Graham
    advanced and I did the same; he stretched out his hand and we
    greeted one another across the prostrate corpse.Before releasing my hand, Black Bart exclaimed in a hoarse
    whisper, "Swear, Gillson, in the presence of the dead, that
    you will forever be faithful, never betray me, and do exactly
    as I bid you, as long as you live!"Fate sat there, cold and
    remorseless as stone.I hesitated; with his left hand he
    slightly raised the lappels of his coat, and grasped the
    handle of a navy revolver.As I gazed, his eyeballs assumed a greenish tint, and his
    brow darkened into a scowl."As your confederate," I answered,
    "never as your slave."The body was lying upon its back, with the face upwards.The
    vultures had despoiled the countenance of every vestige of
    flesh, and left the sockets of the eyes empty.Snow and ice
    and rain had done their work effectually upon the exposed
    surfaces of his clothing, and the eagles had feasted upon the
    entrails.But underneath, the thick beaver cloth had served to
    protect the flesh, and there were some decaying shreds left of
    what had once been the terrible but accomplished Gregory
    Summerfield.But they did
    not interest me so much as another spectacle, that almost
    froze my blood.In the skeleton gripe of the right hand,
    interlaced within the clenched bones, gleamed the wide-mouthed
    vial which was the object of our mutual visit.Graham fell
    upon his knees, and attempted to withdraw the prize from the
    grasp of its dead possessor.But the bones were firm, and when
    he finally succeeded in securing the bottle, by a sudden
    wrench, I heard the skeleton fingers snap like pipe-stems."Hold this a moment, whilst I search the pockets," he
    commanded.He then turned over the corpse, and thrusting his hand into
    the inner breast-pocket, dragged out a roll of MSS., matted
    closely together and stained by the winter's rains.A further
    search eventuated in finding a roll of small gold coin, a set
    of deringer pistols, a mated double-edged dirk, and a pair of
    silver-mounted spectacles.Hastily covering over the body with
    leaves and branches cut from the embowering shrubs, we
    shudderingly left the spot.We slowly descended the gorge toward the banks of the American
    River, until we arrived in a small but sequestered thicket,
    where we threw ourselves upon the ground.Neither had spoken a
    word since we left the scene above described.Graham was the
    first to break the silence which to me had become oppressive."Let us examine the vial and see if the contents are safe."I drew it forth from my pocket and handed it to him."Sealed hermetically, and perfectly secure," he added.Saying
    this he deliberately wrapped it up in a handkerchief and
    placed it in his bosom.As he said this he laughed derisively, and cut
    a most scornful and threatening glance toward me."Yes," I rejoined firmly; "_our_ prize!""Gillson," retorted Graham, "you must regard me as a
    consummate simpleton, or yourself a Goliah.This bottle is
    mine, and _mine_ only.It is a great fortune for _one_, but of
    less value than a toadstool for _two_.I am willing to divide
    fairly.This secret would be of no service to a coward.He
    would not dare to use it.Your share of the robbery of the
    body shall be these MSS.; you can sell them to some poor devil
    of a printer, and pay yourself for your day's work."Saying this he threw the bundle of MSS.at my feet; but I
    disdained to touch them.Observing this, he gathered them up
    safely and replaced them in his pocket."As you are unarmed,"
    he said, "it would not be safe for you to be seen in this
    neighborhood during daylight.We will both spend the night
    here, and just before morning return to Auburn.I will
    accompany you part of the distance."With the _sangfroid_ of a perfect desperado, he then stretched
    himself out in the shadow of a small tree, drank deeply from a
    whisky flagon which he produced, and pulling his hat over his
    eyes, was soon asleep and snoring.It was a long time before I
    could believe the evidence of my own senses.Finally, I
    approached the ruffian, and placed my hand on his shoulder.He
    did not stir a muscle.I listened; I heard only the deep, slow
    breathing of profound slumber.Resolved not to be balked and
    defrauded by such a scoundrel, I stealthily withdrew the vial
    from his pocket, and sprang to my feet, just in time to hear
    the click of a revolver behind me.I remember
    only a dash and an explosion--a deathly sensation, a whirl of
    the rocks and trees about me, a hideous imprecation from the
    lips of my murderer, and I fell senseless to the earth.When I
    awoke to consciousness it was past midnight.I looked up at
    the stars, and recognized Lyra shining full in my face.That
    constellation I knew passed the meridian at this season of the
    year after twelve o'clock, and its slow march told me that
    many weary hours would intervene before daylight.My right arm
    was paralyzed, but I put forth my left, and it rested in a
    pool of my own blood.I
    exclaimed, faintly; but only the low sighing of the night
    blast responded.Shortly after daylight I
    revived, and crawled to the spot where I was discovered on the
    next day by the kind mistress of this cabin.I accuse Bartholomew Graham of my assassination.I do
    this in the perfect possession of my senses, and with a full
    sense of my responsibility to Almighty God.(Signed)                        C. P. GILLSON.GEORGE SIMPSON, Notary Public.KARL LIEBNER,}

  of MSS.which had been thrown in at the transom over the door,
  labeled, "The Summerfield MSS."Attached to them was an unsealed
  note from one Bartholomew Graham, in these words:

    DEAR SIR: These are yours: you have earned them.I commend
    to your especial notice the one styled "_De Mundo Comburendo_."At a future time you may hear again from

                                            BARTHOLOMEW GRAHAM.A casual glance at the papers convinces me that they are of great
  literary value.Summerfield's fame never burned so brightly as it
  does over this grave.[Decoration]

XXVII._THE AVITOR._


    Hurrah for the wings that never tire--
      For the nerves that never quail;
    For the heart that beats in a bosom of fire--
    For the lungs whose cast-iron lobes respire
      Where the eagle's breath would fail!As the genii bore Aladdin away,
      In search of his palace fair,
    On his magical wings to the land of Cathay,
    So here I will spread out my pinions to-day
      On the cloud-borne billows of air.to its home on the mountain crag,
      Where the condor builds its nest,
    I mount far fleeter than hunted stag,
    I float far higher than Switzer flag--
      Hurrah for the lightning's guest!Away, over steeple and cross and tower--
      Away, over river and sea;
    I spurn at my feet the tempests that lower,
    Like minions base of a vanquished power,
      And mutter their thunders at me!Diablo frowns, as above him I pass,
      Still loftier heights to attain;
    Calaveras' groves are but blades of grass--
    Yosemite's sentinel peaks a mass
      Of ant-hills dotting a plain!Sierra Nevada's shroud of snow,
      And Utah's desert of sand,
    Shall never again turn backward the flow
    Of that human tide which may come and go
      To the vales of the sunset land!Wherever the coy earth veils her face
      With tresses of forest hair;
    Where polar pallors her blushes efface,
    Or tropical blooms lend her beauty and grace--
      I can flutter my plumage there!Where the Amazon rolls through a mystical land--
      Where Chiapas buried her dead--
    Where Central Australian deserts expand--
    Where Africa seethes in saharas of sand--
      Even there shall my pinions spread!No longer shall earth with her secrets beguile,
      For I, with undazzled eyes,
    Will trace to their sources the Niger and Nile,
    And stand without dread on the boreal isle,
      The Colon of the skies!Then hurrah for the wings that never tire--
      For the sinews that never quail;
    For the heart that throbs in a bosom of fire--
    For the lungs whose cast-iron lobes respire
      When the eagle's breath would fail![Decoration]


XXVIII._LOST AND FOUND._


    'Twas eventide in Eden.The mortals stood,
    Watchful and solemn, in speechless sorrow bound.He was erect, defiant, and unblenched.Tho' fallen, free--deceived, but not undone.She leaned on him, and drooped her pensive brow
    In token of the character she bore--
    _The world's first penitent_.Tears, gushing fast,
    Streamed from her azure eyes; and as they fled
    Beyond the eastern gate, where gleamed the swords
    Of guarding Cherubim, the flowers themselves
    Bent their sad heads, surcharged with dewy tears,
    Wept by the stare o'er man's immortal woe.Far had they wandered, slow had been the pace,
    Grief at his heart and ruin on her face,
    Ere Adam turned to contemplate the spot
    Where Earth began, where Heaven was forgot.He gazed in silence, till the crystal wall
    Of Eden trembled, as though doomed to fall:
    Then bidding Eve direct her tear-dimmed eye
    To where the foliage kissed the western sky,
    They saw, with horror mingled with surprise,
    The wall, the garden, and the foliage rise!Slowly it mounted to the vaulted dome,
    And paused as if to beckon mortals home;
    Then, like a cloud when winds are all at rest,
    It floated gently to the distant west,
    And left behind a crimson path of light,
    By which to track the Garden in its flight!Day after day, the exiles wandered on,
    With eyes still fixed, where Eden's smile last shone;
    Forlorn and friendless through the wilds they trod,
    Remembering Eden, but forgetting God,
    Till far across the sea-washed, arid plain,
    The billows thundered that the search was vain!who can tell how oft at eventide,
    When the gay west was blushing like a bride,
    Fair Eve hath whispered in her children's ear,
    "Beyond yon cloud will Eden reappear!"And thus, as slow millenniums rolled away,
    Each generation, ere it turned to clay,
    Has with prophetic lore, by nature blest,
    In search of Eden wandered to the West.I cast my thoughts far up the stream of time,
    And catch its murmurs in my careless rhyme.I hear a footstep tripping o'er the down:
    Behold!In fancy now her splendors reappear;
    Her fleets and phalanxes, her shield and spear;
    Her battle-fields, blest ever by the free,--
    Proud Marathon, and sad Thermopylae!Her poet, foremost in the ranks of fame,
    Homer!a god--but with a mortal's name;
    Historians, richest in primeval lore;
    Orations, sounding yet from shore to shore!Heroes and statesmen throng the enraptured gaze,
    Till glory totters 'neath her load of praise.Surely a clime so rich in old renown
    Could build an Eden, if not woo one down!Plato comes, with wisdom's scroll unfurl'd,
    The proudest gift of Athens to the world!Wisest of mortals, say, for thou can'st tell,
    Thou, whose sweet lips the Muses loved so well,
    Was Greece the Garden that our fathers trod;
    When men, like angels, walked the earth with God?the great Philosopher replied,
    "Though I love Athens better than a bride,
    Her laws are bloody and her children slaves;
    Her sages slumber in empoisoned graves;
    Her soil is sterile, barren are her seas;
    Eden still blooms in the Hesperides,
    Beyond the pillars of far Hercules!Westward, amid the ocean's blandest smile,
    Atlantis blossoms, a perennial Isle;
    A vast Republic stretching far and wide,
    Greater than Greece and Macedon beside!"Across the mental screen
    A mightier spirit stalks upon the scene;
    His tread shakes empires ancient as the sun;
    His voice resounds, and nations are undone;
    War in his tone and battle in his eye,
    The world in arms, a Roman dare defy!Throned on the summit of the seven hills,
    He bathes his gory heel in Tiber's rills;
    Stretches his arms across a triple zone,
    And dares be master of mankind, alone!All peoples send their tribute to his store;
    Wherever rivers glide or surges roar,
    Or mountains rise or desert plains expand,
    His minions sack and pillage every land.But not alone for rapine and for war
    The Roman eagle spreads his pinions far;
    He bears a sceptre in his talons strong,
    To guard the right, to rectify the wrong,
    And carries high, in his imperial beak,
    A shield armored to protect the weak.Justice and law are dropping from his wing,
    Equal alike for consul, serf or king;
    Daggers for tyrants, for patriot-heroes fame,
    Attend like menials on the Roman name!Was Rome the Eden of our ancient state,
    Just in her laws, in her dominion great,
    Wise in her counsels, matchless in her worth,
    Acknowledged great proconsul of the earth?An eye prophetic that has read the leaves
    The sibyls scattered from their loosened sheaves,
    A bard that sang at Rome in all her pride,
    Shall give response;--let Seneca decide!"Beyond the rocks where Shetland's breakers roar,
    And clothe in foam the wailing, ice-bound shore,
    Within the bosom of a tranquil sea,
    Where Earth has reared her _Ultima Thule_,
    The gorgeous West conceals a golden clime,
    The petted child, the paragon of Time!In distant years, when Ocean's mountain wave
    Shall rock a cradle, not upheave a grave,
    When men shall walk the pathway of the brine,
    With feet as safe as Terra watches mine,
    Then shall the barriers of the Western Sea
    Despised and broken down forever be;
    Then man shall spurn old Ocean's loftiest crest,
    And tear the secret from his stormy breast!"Night settles down
    And shrouds the world in black Plutonian frown;
    Earth staggers on, like mourners to a tomb,
    Wrapt in one long millennium of gloom.That past, the light breaks through the clouds of war,
    And drives the mists of Bigotry afar;
    Amalfi sees her burial tomes unfurl'd,
    And dead Justinian rules again the world.The torch of Science is illumed once more;
    Adventure gazes from the surf-beat shore,
    Lifts in his arms the wave-worn Genoese,
    And hails Iberia, Mistress of the Seas!What cry resounds along the Western main,
    Mounts to the stars, is echoed back again,
    And wakes the voices of the startled sea,
    Dumb until now, from past eternity?is chanted from the Pinta's deck;
    Smiling afar, a minute glory-speck,
    But grandly rising from the convex sea,
    To crown Colon with immortality,
    The Western World emerges from the wave,
    God's last asylum for the free and brave!But where within this ocean-bounded clime,
    This fairest offspring of the womb of time,--
    Plato's Atlantis, risen from the sea,
    Utopia's realm, beyond old Rome's Thule,--
    Where shall we find, within this giant land,
    By blood redeemed, with Freedom's rainbow spann'd,
    The spot first trod by mortals on the earth,
    Where Adam's race was cradled into birth?'Twas sought by Cortez with his warrior band,
    In realms once ruled by Montezuma's hand;
    Where the old Aztec, 'neath his hills of snow,
    Built the bright domes of silver Mexico.Pizarro sought it where the Inca's rod
    Proclaimed the prince half-mortal, demi-god,
    When the mild children of unblest Peru
    Before the bloodhounds of the conqueror flew,
    And saw their country and their race undone,
    And perish 'neath the Temple of the Sun!De Soto sought it, with his tawny bride,
    Near where the Mississippi's waters glide,
    Beneath the ripples of whose yellow wave
    He found at last both monument and grave.Old Ponce de Leon, in the land of flowers,
    Searched long for Eden'midst her groves and bowers,
    Whilst brave La Salle, where Texan prairies smile,
    Roamed westward still, to reach the happy isle.The Pilgrim Fathers on the Mayflower's deck,
    Fleeing beyond a tyrant's haughty beck,
    In quest of Eden, trod the rock-bound shore,
    Where bleak New England's wintry surges roar;
    Raleigh, with glory in his eagle eye,
    Chased the lost realm beneath a Southern sky;
    Whilst Boone believed that Paradise was found
    In old Kentucky's "dark and bloody ground!"In vain their labors, all in vain their toil;
    Doomed ne'er to breathe that air nor tread that soil.Heaven had reserved it till a race sublime
    Should launch its heroes on the wave of time!Go with me now, ye Californian band,
    And gaze with wonder at your glorious land;
    Ascend the summit of yon middle chain,
    When Mount Diablo rises from the plain,
    And cast your eyes with telescopic power,
    O'er hill and forest, over field and flower.how free the hand of God hath roll'd
    A wave of wealth across your Land of Gold!The mountains ooze it from their swelling breast,
    The milk-white quartz displays it in her crest;
    Each tiny brook that warbles to the sea,
    Harps on its strings a golden melody;
    Whilst the young waves are cradled on the shore
    On spangling pillows, stuffed with golden ore!See the Sacramento glide
    Through valleys blooming like a royal bride,
    And bearing onward to the ocean's shore
    A richer freight than Arno ever bore!also fanned by cool refreshing gales,
    Fair Petaluma and her sister vales,
    Whose fields and orchards ornament the plain
    And deluge earth with one vast sea of grain!Santa Clara smiles afar,
    As in the fields of heaven, a radiant star;
    Los Angeles is laughing through her vines;
    Old Monterey sits moody midst her pines;
    Far San Diego flames her golden bow,
    And Santa Barbara sheds her fleece of snow,
    Whilst Bernardino's ever-vernal down
    Gleams like an emerald in a monarch's crown!On the plains of San Joaquin
    Ten thousand herds in dense array are seen.Aloft like columns propping up the skies
    The cloud-kissed groves of Calaveras rise;
    Whilst dashing downward from their dizzy home
    The thundering falls of Yo Semite foam!Opening on an ocean great,
    Behold the portal of the Golden Gate!Pillared on granite, destined e'er to stand
    The iron rampart of the sunset land!With rosy cheeks, fanned by the fresh sea-breeze,
    The petted child of the Pacific seas,
    See San Francisco smile!Majestic heir
    Of all that's brave, or bountiful, or fair,
    Pride of our land, by every wave carest,
    And hailed by nations, Venice of the West!why should I tell,
    What every eye and bosom know so well?Why thy name the land all other lands have blest,
    And traced for ages to the distant West?Why search in vain throughout th' historic page
    For Eden's garden and the Golden Age?NO FURTHER LET US ROAM;
    THIS IS THE GARDEN![Decoration]

Printer Corrections and Notes:

p."THE TELESCOPIC EYE" changed
from p."THE EMERALD EYE from p.and "Secondly", to conform with remaining
recitations on succeeding page 202.

p.227, "The thought crossed my mind, Can this be a spirit?"Wherever the printer used a row of asterisks as a separator, the number
of asterisks used has been standardized to 5.Wherever the printer used blank space as a separator, a row of five
number signs (#) appears.The learned author places '_Ra_' at the head of the Pantheon, stating
that the meaning of the word is simply _God_, or the God emphatically.We know that _Ra_ was the Sun among the Egyptians, and that the
hieroglyph, a circle, representation of that God was the same in Babylon
as in Egypt.It formed an element in the native name of Babylon.Now the Mayas called LA, that which has existed for ever, the truth _par
excellence_.As to the native name of Babylon it would simply be the
_city of the infinite truth_--_cah_, city; LA, eternal truth.Ana, like Ra, is thought to have signified _God_ in the highest sense.His epithets mark priority and
antiquity; _the original chief_, the _father of the gods_, the _lord of
darkness or death_.The Maya gives us A, _thy_; NA, _mother_.At times
he was called DIS, and was the patron god of _Erech_, the great city of
the dead, the necropolis of Lower Babylonia.TIX, Maya is a cavity
formed in the earth.It seems to have given its name to the city of
_Niffer_, called _Calneh_ in the translation of the Septuagint, from
_kal-ana_, which is translated the "fort of Ana;" or according to the
Maya, the _prison of Ana_, KAL being prison, or the prison of thy
mother.ANATA

the supposed wife of Ana, has no peculiar characteristics.Her name is
only, says our author, the feminine form of the masculine, Ana.But the
Maya designates her as the companion of Ana; TA, with; _Anata_ with
_Ana_.BIL OR ENU

seems to mean merely Lord.It is usually followed by a qualificative
adjunct, possessing great interest, NIPRU.To that name, which recalls
that of NEBROTH or _Nimrod_, the author gives a Syriac etymology; napar
(make to flee).His epithets are the _supreme_, _the father of the
gods_, the _procreator_.The Maya gives us BIL, or _Bel_; the way, the road; hence the _origin_,
the father, the procreator.Also ENA, who is before; again the father,
the procreator.As to the qualificative adjunct _nipru_.It would seem to be the Maya
_niblu_; _nib_, to thank; LU, the _Bagre_, a _silurus fish_._Niblu_
would then be the _thanksgiving fish_.Strange to say, the high priest
at Uxmal and Chichen, elder brother of Chaacmol, first son of _Can_, the
founder of those cities, is CAY, the fish, whose effigy is my last
discovery in June, among the ruins of Uxmal.The bust is contained
within the jaws of a serpent, _Can_, and over it, is a beautiful
mastodon head, with the trunk inscribed with Egyptian characters, which
read TZAA, that which is necessary.BELTIS

is the wife of _Bel-nipru_.But she is more than his mere female power.Her common title is the _Great
Goddess_.In Chaldea her name was _Mulita_ or _Enuta_, both words
signifying the lady.Her favorite title was the _mother of the gods_,
the origin of the gods.In Maya BEL is the road, the way; and TE means _here_.BELTE or BELTIS
would be I am the way, the origin._Mulita_ would correspond to MUL-TE, many here, _many in me_.Her other name _Enuta_ seems to be (Maya) _Ena-te_,
signifies ENA, the first, before anybody, and TE here.ENATE, _I am here
before anybody_, I am the mother of the Gods.The God Fish, the mystic animal, half man, half fish, which came up from
the Persian gulf to teach astronomy and letters to the first settlers on
the Euphrates and Tigris.According to Berosus the civilization was brought to Mesopotamia by
_Oannes_ and six other beings, who, like himself, were half man, half
fish, and that they came from the Indian Ocean.We have already seen
that the Mayas of India were not only architects, but also astronomers;
and the symbolic figure of a being half man and half fish seems to
clearly indicate that those who brought civilization to the shores of
the Euphrates and Tigris came in boats.Hoa-Ana, or Oannes, according to the Maya would mean, he who has his
residence or house on the water.HA, being water; _a_, thy; _na_, house;
literally, _water thy house_.Canon Rawlison remarks in that
connection: "There are very strong grounds for connecting HEA or Hoa,
with the serpent of the Scripture, and the paradisaical traditions of
the tree of knowledge and the tree of life."As the title of the god of
knowledge and science, _Oannes_, is the lord of the abyss, or of the
great deep, the intelligent fish, one of his emblems being the serpent,
CAN, which occupies so conspicuous a place among the symbols of the gods
on the black stones recording benefactions.DAV-KINA

Is the wife of _Hoa_, and her name is thought to signify the chief lady.But the Maya again gives us another meaning that seems to me more
appropriate.TAB-KIN would be the _rays of the sun_: the rays of the
light brought with civilization by her husband to benighted inhabitants
of Mesopotamia.SIN OR HURKI

is the name of the moon deity; the etymology of it is quite uncertain.Its titles, as Rawlison remarks, are somewhat vague.Yet it is
particularly designated as "_the bright_, _the shining_" the lord of the
month.Zin in Maya has also many significations._Zinil_ is the extension of the whole of the universe._Hurki_ would be
the Maya HULKIN--sun-stroked; he who receives directly the rays of the
sun.Hurki is also the god presiding over buildings and architecture; in
this connection he is called _Bel-Zuna_.The _lord of building_, the
_supporting architect_, the _strengthener of fortifications_._Bel-Zuna_
would also signify the lord of the strong house._Zuu_, Maya, close,
thick._Na_, house: and the city where he had his great temple was _Ur_;
named after him._U_, in Maya, signifies moon.SAN OR SANSI,

the Sun God, the _lord of fire_, the _ruler of the day_.He _who
illumines the expanse of heaven and earth_._Zamal_ (Maya) is the morning, the dawn of the day, and his symbols are
the same on the temples of Yucatan as on those of Chaldea, India and
Egypt.VUL OR IVA,

the prince of the powers of the air, the lord of the whirlwind and the
tempest, the wielder of the thunderbolt, the lord of the air, he who
makes the tempest to rage.Hiba in Maya is to rub, to scour, to chafe as
does the tempest.As VUL he is represented with a flaming sword in his
hand._Hul_ (Maya) an arrow.He is then the god of the atmosphere, who
gives rain.ISHTAR OR NANA,

the Chaldean Venus, of the etymology of whose name no satisfactory
account can be given, says the learned author, whose list I am following
and description quoting.The Maya language, however, affords a very natural etymology.Her name
seems composed of _ix_, the feminine article, _she_; and of _tac_, or
_tal_, a verb that signifies to have a desire to satisfy a corporal want
or inclination.IXTAL would, therefore, be she who desires to satisfy a
corporal inclination.As to her other name, _Nana_, it simply means the
great mother, the very mother.If from the names of god and goddesses,
we pass to that of places, we will find that the Maya language also
furnishes a perfect etymology for them.In the account of the creation of the world, according to the Chaldeans,
we find that a woman whose name in Chaldee is _Thalatth_, was said to
have ruled over the monstrous animals of strange forms, that were
generated and existed in darkness and water.The Greek called her
_Thalassa_ (the sea).But the Maya vocable _Thallac_, signifies a thing
without steadiness, like the sea.The first king of the Chaldees was a great architect.To him are
ascribed the most archaic monuments of the plains of Lower Mesopotamia.He is said to have conceived the plans of the Babylonian Temple.He
constructed his edifices of mud and bricks, with rectangular bases,
their angles fronting the cardinal points; receding stages, exterior
staircases, with shrines crowning the whole structure.In this
description of the primitive constructions of the Chaldeans, no one can
fail to recognize the Maya mode of building, and we see them not only in
Yucatan, but throughout Central America, Peru, even Hindoostan.The very
name _Urkuh_ seems composed of two Maya words HUK, to make everything,
and LUK, mud; he who makes everything of mud; so significative of his
building propensities and of the materials used by him.The etymology of the name of that country, as well as that of Asshur,
the supreme god of the Assyrians, who never pronounced his name without
adding "Asshur is my lord," is still an undecided matter amongst the
learned philologists of our days.Some contend that the country was
named after the god Asshur; others that the god Asshur received his name
from the place where he was worshiped.None agree, however, as to the
significative meaning of the name Asshur.In Assyrian and Hebrew
languages the name of the country and people is derived from that of the
god.That Asshur was the name of the deity, and that the country was
named after it, I have no doubt, since I find its etymology, so much
sought for by philologists, in the American Maya language.Effectively
the word _asshur_, sometimes written _ashur_, would be AXUL in Maya._A_, in that language, placed before a noun, is the possessive pronoun,
as the second person, thy or thine, and _xul_, means end, termination.It is also the name of the sixth month of the Maya calendar._Axul_
would therefore be _thy end_.Among all the nations which have
recognized the existence of a SUPREME BEING, Deity has been considered
as the beginning and end of all things, to which all aspire to be
united.A strange coincidence that may be without significance, but is not out
of place to mention here, is the fact that the early kings of Chaldea
are represented on the monuments as sovereigns over the _Kiprat-arbat_,
or FOUR RACES.While tradition tells us that the great lord of the
universe, king of the giants, whose capital was _Tiahuanaco_, the
magnificent ruins of which are still to be seen on the shores of the
lake of Titicaca, reigned over _Ttahuatyn-suyu_, the FOUR PROVINCES.In
the _Chou-King_ we read that in very remote times _China_ was called by
its inhabitants _Sse-yo_, THE FOUR PARTS OF THE EMPIRE.The
_Manava-Dharma-Sastra_, the _Ramayana_, and other sacred books of
Hindostan also inform us that the ancient Hindoos designated their
country as the FOUR MOUNTAINS, and from some of the monumental
inscriptions at Uxmal it would seem that, among other names, that place
was called the land of the _canchi_, or FOUR MOUTHS, that recalls
vividly the name of Chaldea _Arba-Lisun_, the FOUR TONGUES.That the language of the Mayas was known in Chaldea in remote ages, but
became lost in the course of time, is evident from the Book of Daniel.It seems that some of the learned men of Judea understood it still at
the beginning of the Christian era, as many to-day understand Greek,
Latin, Sanscrit, &c.; since, we are informed by the writers of the
Gospels of St.Mark, that the last words of Jesus of
Nazareth expiring on the cross were uttered in it.In the fifth chapter of the Book of Daniel, we read that the fingers of
the hand of a man were seen writing on the wall of the hall, where King
Belshazzar was banqueting, the words "Mene, mene, Tekel, upharsin,"
which could not be read by any of the wise men summoned by order of the
king.Daniel, however, being brought in, is said to have given as their
interpretation: _Numbered_, _numbered_, _weighed_, _dividing_, perhaps
with the help of the angel Gabriel, who is said by learned rabbins to be
the only individual of the angelic hosts who can speak Chaldean and
Syriac, and had once before assisted him in interpreting the dream of
King Nebuchadnezzar.Perhaps also, having been taught the learning of
the Chaldeans, he had studied the ancient Chaldee language, and was thus
enabled to read the fatidical words, which have the very same meaning in
the Maya language as he gave them.Effectively, _mene_ or _mane_,
_numbered_, would seem to correspond to the Maya verbs, MAN, to buy, to
purchase, hence to number, things being sold by the quantity--or MANEL,
to pass, to exceed._Tekel_, weighed, would correspond to TEC, light.To-day it is used in the sense of lightness in motion, brevity,
nimbleness: and _Upharsin_, dividing, seem allied to the words PPA, to
divide two things united; or _uppah_, to break, making a sharp sound; or
_paah_, to break edifices; or, again, PAALTAL, to break, to scatter the
inhabitants of a place.As to the last words of Jesus of Nazareth, when expiring on the cross,
as reported by the Evangelists, _Eli, Eli_, according to St.Matthew,
and _Eloi, Eloi_, according to St.Mark, _lama sabachthani_, they are
pure Maya vocables; but have a very different meaning to that attributed
to them, and more in accordance with His character.By placing in the
mouth of the dying martyr these words: _My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me?_ they have done him an injustice, presenting him in his
last moments despairing and cowardly, traits so foreign to his life, to
his teachings, to the resignation shown by him during his trial, and to
the fortitude displayed by him in his last journey to Calvary; more than
all, so unbecoming, not to say absurd, being in glaring contradiction to
his role as God.If God himself, why complain that God has forsaken him?He evidently did not speak Hebrew in dying, since his two mentioned
biographers inform us that the people around him did not understand what
he said, and supposed he was calling Elias to help him: _This man
calleth for Elias._

His bosom friend, who never abandoned him--who stood to the last at the
foot of the cross, with his mother and other friends and relatives, do
not report such unbefitting words as having been uttered by Jesus.He
simply says, that after recommending his mother to his care, he
complained of being thirsty, and that, as the sponge saturated with
vinegar was applied to his mouth, he merely said: IT IS FINISHED!and
_he bowed his head and gave up the ghost_.Well, this is exactly the meaning of the Maya words, HELO, HELO, LAMAH
ZABAC TA NI, literally: HELO, HELO, now, now; LAMAH, sinking; ZABAC,
black ink; TA, over; NI, nose; in our language: _Now, now I am sinking;
darkness covers my face!_ No weakness, no despair--He merely tells his
friends all is over.Before leaving Asia Minor, in order to seek in Egypt the vestiges of the
Mayas, I will mention the fact that the names of some of the natives who
inhabited of old that part of the Asiatic continent, and many of those
of places and cities seem to be of American Maya origin.The Promised
Land, for example--that part of the coast of Phoenicia so famous for
the fertility of its soil, where the Hebrews, after journeying during
forty years in the desert, arrived at last, tired and exhausted from so
many hard-fought battles--was known as _Canaan_.This is a Maya word
that means to be tired, to be fatigued; and, if it is spelled _Kanaan_,
it then signifies abundance; both significations applying well to the
country.TYRE, the great emporium of the Phoenicians, called _Tzur_, probably
on account of being built on a rock, may also derive its name from the
Maya TZUC, a promontory, or a number of villages, _Tzucub_ being a
province.Again, we have the people called _Khati_ by the Egyptians.They formed a
great nation that inhabited the _Caele-Syria_ and the valley of the
Orontes, where they have left very interesting proofs of their passage
on earth, in large and populous cities whose ruins have been lately
discovered.Their origin is unknown, and is yet a problem to be solved.They are celebrated on account of their wars against the Assyrians and
Egyptians, who call them the plague of Khati.Their name is frequently
mentioned in the Scriptures as Hittites.Placed on the road, between the
Assyrians and the Egyptians, by whom they were at last vanquished, they
placed well nigh insuperable _obstacles in the way_ of the conquests of
these two powerful nations, which found in them tenacious and fearful
adversaries.The Khati had not only made considerable improvements in
all military arts, but were also great and famed merchants; their
emporium _Carchemish_ had no less importance than Tyre or Carthage.There, met merchants from all parts of the world; who brought thither
the products and manufactures of their respective countries, and were
wont to worship at the Sacred City, _Katish_ of the Khati.The etymology
of their name is also unknown.Some historians having pretended that
they were a Scythian tribe, derived it from Scythia; but I think that we
may find it very natural, as that of their principal cities, in the Maya
language.All admit that the Khati, until the time when they were vanquished by
Rameses the Great, as recorded on the walls of his palace at Thebes, the
_Memnonium_, always placed obstacles on the way of the Egyptians and
opposed them.According to the Maya, their name is significative of
these facts, since KAT or KATAH is a verb that means to place
impediments on the road, to come forth and obstruct the passage._Carchemish_ was their great emporium, where merchants from afar
congregated; it was consequently a city of merchants.CAH means a city,
and _Chemul_ is navigator._Carchemish_ would then be _cah-chemul_, the
city of navigators, of merchants.KATISH, their sacred city, would be the city where sacrifices are
offered.CAH, city, and TICH, a ceremony practiced by the ancient Mayas,
and still performed by their descendants all through Central America.This sacrifice or ceremony consists in presenting to BALAM, the
_Yumil-Kaax_, the "Lord of the fields," the _primitiae_ of all their
fruits before beginning the harvest.Katish, or _cah-tich_ would then be
the city of the sacrifices--the holy city.EGYPT is the country that in historical times has called, more than any
other, the attention of the students, of all nations and in all ages, on
account of the grandeur and beauty of its monuments; the peculiarity of
its inhabitants; their advanced civilization, their great attainments in
all branches of human knowledge and industry; and its important position
at the head of all other nations of antiquity.Egypt has been said to be
the source from which human knowledge began to flow over the old world:
yet no one knows for a certainty whence came the people that laid the
first foundations of that interesting nation.That they were not
autochthones is certain.Their learned priests pointed towards the
regions of the West as the birth-place of their ancestors, and
designated the country in which they lived, the East, as the _pure
land_, the _land of the sun_, of _light_, in contradistinction of the
country of the dead, of darkness--the Amenti, the West--where Osiris sat
as King, reigning judge, over the souls.If in Hindostan, Afghanistan, Chaldea, Asia Minor, we have met with
vestiges of the Mayas, in Egypt we will find their traces everywhere.Whatever may have been the name given to the valley watered by the Nile
by its primitive inhabitants, no one at present knows.The invaders that
came from the West called it CHEM: not on account of the black color of
the soil, as Plutarch pretends in his work, "_De Iside et Osiride_," but
more likely because either they came to it in boats; or, quite probably,
because when they arrived the country was inundated, and the inhabitants
communicated by means of boats, causing the new comers to call it the
country of boats--CHEM (maya).[TN-20] The hieroglyph representing the
name of Egypt is composed of the character used for land, a cross
circumscribed by a circle, and of another, read K, which represent a
sieve, it is said, but that may likewise be the picture of a small boat.The Assyrians designated Egypt under the names of MISIR or MISUR,
probably because the country is generally destitute of trees.These are
uprooted during the inundations, and then carried by the currents all
over the country; so that the farmers, in order to be able to plow the
soil, are obliged to clear it first from the dead trees.Now we have the
Maya verb MIZ--to _clean_, to _remove rubbish formed by the body of dead
trees_; whilst the verb MUSUR means to _cut the trees by the roots_.It
would seem that the name _Mizraim_ given to Egypt in the Scriptures also
might come from these words.When the Western invaders reached the country it was probably covered by
the waters of the river, to which, we are told, they gave the name of
_Hapimu_.Its etymology seems to be yet undecided by the Egyptologists,
who agree, however, that its meaning is the _abyss of water_.The Maya
tells us that this name is composed of two words--HA, water, and PIMIL,
the thickness of flat things._Hapimu_, or HAPIMIL, would then be the
thickness, the _abyss of water_.We find that the prophets _Jeremiah_ (xlvi., 25,) and _Nahum_ (iii., 8,
10,) call THEBES, the capital of upper Egypt during the XVIII.dynasty:
NO or NA-AMUN, the mansion of Amun._Na_ signifies in Maya, house,
mansion, residence.But _Thebes_ is written in Egyptian hieroglyphs AP,
or APE, the meaning of which is the head, the capital; with the feminine
article T, that is always used as its prefix in hieroglyphic writings,
it becomes TAPE; which, according to Sir Gardner Wilkinson ("Manners and
Customs of the Ancient Egyptians," _tom._ III., page 210, N. Y. Edition,
1878), was pronounced by the Egyptians _Taba_; and in the Menphitic
dialect Thaba, that the Greeks converted into Thebai, whence Thebes.The
Maya verb _Teppal_, signifies to reign, to govern, to order.On each
side of the mastodons' heads, which form so prominent a feature in the
ornaments of the oldest edifices at Uxmal, Chichen-Itza and other parts,
the word _Dapas_; hence TABAS is written in ancient Egyptian characters,
and read, I presume, in old Maya, _head_.To-day the word is pronounced
THAB, and means _baldness_.The identity of the names of deities worshiped by individuals, of their
religious rites and belief; that of the names of the places which they
inhabit; the similarity of their customs, of their dresses and manners;
the sameness of their scientific attainments and of the characters used
by them in expressing their language in writing, lead us naturally to
infer that they have had a common origin, or, at least, that their
forefathers were intimately connected.If we may apply this inference to
nations likewise, regardless of the distance that to-day separates the
countries where they live, I can then affirm that the Mayas and the
Egyptians are either of a common descent, or that very intimate
communication must have existed in remote ages between their ancestors.Without entering here into a full detail of the customs and manners of
these people, I will make a rapid comparison between their religious
belief, their customs, manners, scientific attainments, and the
characters used by them in writing etc., sufficient to satisfy any
reasonable body that the strange coincidences that follow, cannot be
altogether accidental.The SUN, RA, was the supreme god worshiped throughout the land of Egypt;
and its emblem was a disk or circle, at times surmounted by the serpent
Uraeus.Egypt was frequently called the Land of the Sun.RA or LA
signifies in Maya that which exists, emphatically that which is--the
truth.The sun was worshiped by the ancient Mayas; and the Indians to-day
preserve the dance used by their forefathers among the rites of the
adoration of that luminary, and perform it yet in certain epoch[TN-21]
of the year.The coat-of-arms of the city of Uxmal, sculptured on the
west facade of the sanctuary, attached to the masonic temple in that
city, teaches us that the place was called U LUUMIL KIN, _the land of
the sun_.This name forming the center of the escutcheon, is written
with a cross, circumscribed by a circle, that among the Egyptians is
the sign for land, region, surrounded by the rays of the sun.Colors in Egypt, as in Mayab, seem to have had the same symbolical
meaning.The figure of _Amun_ was that of a man whose body was light
blue, like the Indian god Wishnu,[TN-22] and that of the god Nilus; as if
to indicate their peculiar exalted and heavenly nature; this color being
that of the pure, bright skies above.The blue color had exactly the
same significance in Mayab, according to Landa and Cogolludo, who tell
us that, even at the time of the Spanish conquest, the bodies of those
who were to be sacrificed to the gods were painted blue.The mural
paintings in the funeral chamber of Chaacmol, at Chichen, confirm this
assertion.There we see figures of men and women painted blue, some
marching to the sacrifice with their hands tied behind their backs.After being thus painted they were venerated by the people, who regarded
them as sanctified.Blue in Egypt was always the color used at the
funerals.The Egyptians believed in the immortality of the soul; and that rewards
and punishments were adjudged by Osiris, the king of the Amenti, to the
souls according to their deeds during their mundane life.That the souls
after a period of three thousand years were to return to earth and
inhabit again their former earthly tenements.This was the reason why
they took so much pains to embalm the body.The Mayas also believed in the immortality of the soul, as I have
already said.Their belief was that after the spirit had suffered during
a time proportioned to their misdeeds whilst on earth, and after having
enjoyed an amount of bliss corresponding to their good actions, they
were to return to earth and live again a material life.Accordingly, as
the body was corruptible, they made statues of stones, terra-cotta, or
wood, in the semblance of the deceased, whose ashes they deposited in a
hollow made for that purpose in the back of the head.Sometimes also in
stone urns, as in the case of Chaacmol.The spirits, on their return to
earth, were to find these statues, impart life to them, and use them as
body during their new existence.I am not certain but that, as the Egyptians also, they were believers in
transmigration; and that this belief exists yet among the aborigines.I
have noticed that my Indians were unwilling to kill any animal whatever,
even the most noxious and dangerous, that inhabits the ruined monuments.I have often told them to kill some venomous insect or serpent that may
have happened to be in our way.They invariably refused to do so, but
softly and carefully caused them to go.And when asked why they did not
kill them, declined to answer except by a knowing and mysterious smile,
as if afraid to let a stranger into their intimate beliefs inherited
from their ancestors: remembering, perhaps, the fearful treatment
inflicted by fanatical friars on their fathers to oblige them to forego
what they called the superstitions of their race--the idolatrous creed
of their forefathers.I have had opportunity to discover that their faith in reincarnation, as
many other time-honored credences, still exists among them, unshaken,
notwithstanding the persecutions and tortures suffered by them at the
hands of ignorant and barbaric _Christians_ (?)I will give two instances when that belief in reincarnation was plainly
manifested.The day that, after surmounting many difficulties, when my ropes and
cables, made of withes and the bark of the _habin_ tree, were finished
and adjusted to the capstan manufactured of hollow stones and trunks of
trees; and I had placed the ponderous statue of Chaacmol on rollers,
already in position to drag it up the inclined plane made from the
surface of the ground to a few feet above the bottom of the excavation;
my men, actuated by their superstitious fears on the one hand, and
their profound reverence for the memory of their ancestors on the other,
unwilling to see the effigy of one of the great men removed from where
their ancestors had placed it in ages gone by resolved to bury it, by
letting loose the hill of dry stones that formed the body of the
mausoleum, and were kept from falling in the hole by a framework of thin
trunks of trees tied with withes, and in order that it should not be
injured, to capsize it, placing the face downward.They had already
overturned it, when I interfered in time to prevent more mischief, and
even save some of them from certain death; since by cutting loose the
withes that keep the framework together, the sides of the excavation
were bound to fall in, and crush those at the bottom.I honestly think,
knowing their superstitious feelings and propensities, that they had
made up their mind to sacrifice their lives, in order to avoid what they
considered a desecration of the future tenement that the great warrior
and king was yet to inhabit, when time had arrived.In order to overcome
their scruples, and also to prove if my suspicions were correct, that,
as their forefathers and the Egyptians of old, they still believed in
reincarnation, I caused them to accompany me to the summit of the great
pyramid.There is a monument, that served as a castle when the city of
the holy men, the Itzaes, was at the height of its splendor.Every anta,
every pillar and column of this edifice is sculptured with portraits of
warriors and noblemen.Among these many with long beards, whose types
recall vividly to the mind the features of the Afghans.On one of the antae, at the entrance on the north side, is the portrait
of a warrior wearing a long, straight, pointed beard.The face, like
that of all the personages represented in the bas-reliefs, is in
profile.I placed my head against the stone so as to present the same
position of my face as that of UXAN, and called the attention of my
Indians to the similarity of his and my own features.They followed
every lineament of the faces with their fingers to the very point of the
beard, and soon uttered an exclamation of astonishment: "_Thou!_
_here!_" and slowly scanned again the features sculptured on the stone
and my own."_So, so,_" they said, "_thou too art one of our great men, who has been
disenchanted.Thou, too, wert a companion of the great Lord Chaacmol.That is why thou didst know where he was hidden; and thou hast come to
disenchant him also.His time to live again on earth has then arrived._"

From that moment every word of mine was implicitly obeyed.They returned
to the excavation, and worked with such a good will, that they soon
brought up the ponderous statue to the surface.A few days later some strange people made their appearance suddenly and
noiselessly in our midst.They emerged from the thicket one by one.Colonel _Don_ Felipe Diaz, then commander of the troops covering the
eastern frontier, had sent me, a couple of days previous, a written
notice, that I still preserve in my power, that tracks of hostile
Indians had been discovered by his scouts, advising me to keep a sharp
look out, lest they should surprise us.Now, to be on the look out in
the midst of a thick, well-nigh impenetrable forest, is a rather
difficult thing to do, particularly with only a few men, and where there
is no road; yet all being a road for the enemy.Warning my men that
danger was near, and to keep their loaded rifles at hand, we continued
our work as usual, leaving the rest to destiny.On seeing the strangers, my men rushed on their weapons, but noticing
that the visitors had no guns, but only their _machetes_, I gave orders
not to hurt them.At their head was a very old man: his hair was gray,
his eyes blue with age.He would not come near the statue, but stood at
a distance as if awe-struck, hat in hand, looking at it.After a long
time he broke out, speaking to his own people: "This, boys, is one of
the great men we speak to you about."Then the young men came forward,
with great respect kneeled at the feet of the statue, and pressed their
lips against them.Putting aside my own weapons, being consequently unarmed, I went to the
old man, and asked him to accompany me up to the castle, offering my arm
to ascend the 100 steep and crumbling stairs.I again placed my face
near that of my stone _Sosis_, and again the same scene was enacted as
with my own men, with this difference, that the strangers fell on their
knees before me, and, in turn, kissed my hand.The old man after a
while, eyeing me respectfully, but steadily, asked me: "Rememberest thou
what happened to thee whilst thou wert enchanted?"It was quite a
difficult question to answer, and yet retain my superior position, for I
did not know how many people might be hidden in the thicket."Well,
father," I asked him, "dreamest thou sometimes?"He nodded his head in
an affirmative manner."And when thou awakest, dost thou remember
distinctly thy dreams?""Well, father," I
continued, "so it happened with me.I do not remember what took place
during the time I was enchanted."I
again gave him my hand to help him down the precipitous stairs, at the
foot of which we separated, wishing them God-speed, and warning them not
to go too near the villages on their way back to their homes, as people
were aware of their presence in the country.Whence they came, I ignore;
where they went, I don't know.Circumcision was a rite in usage among the Egyptians since very remote
times.The Mayas also practiced it, if we are to credit Fray Luis de
Urreta; yet Cogolludo affirms that in his days the Indians denied
observing such custom.The outward sign of utmost reverence seems to
have been identical amongst both the Mayas and the Egyptians.It
consisted in throwing the left arm across the chest, resting the left
hand on the right shoulder; or the right arm across the chest, the
right hand resting on the left shoulder.Sir Gardner Wilkinson, in his
work above quoted, reproduces various figures in that attitude; and Mr.Champollion Figeac, in his book on Egypt, tells us that in some cases
even the mummies of certain eminent men were placed in their coffins
with the arms in that position.That this same mark of respect was in
use amongst the Mayas there can be no possible doubt.We see it in the
figures represented in the act of worshiping the mastodon's head, on the
west facade of the monument that forms the north wing of the palace and
museum at Chichen-Itza.We see it repeatedly in the mural paintings in
Chaacmol's funeral chamber; on the slabs sculptured with the
representation of a dying warrior, that adorned the mausoleum of that
chieftain.Cogolludo mentions it in his history of Yucatan, as being
common among the aborigines: and my own men have used it to show their
utmost respect to persons or objects they consider worthy of their
veneration.Among my collection of photographs are several plates in
which some of the men have assumed that position of the arms
spontaneously._The sistrum_ was an instrument used by Egyptians and Mayas alike during
the performance of their religious rites and acts of worship.I have
seen it used lately by natives in Yucatan in the dance forming part of
the worship of the sun.The Egyptians enclosed the brains, entrails and
viscera of the deceased in funeral vases, called _canopas_, that were
placed in the tombs with the coffin.When I opened Chaacmol's mausoleum
I found, as I have already said, two stone urns, the one near the head
containing the remains of brains, that near the chest those of the heart
and other viscera.This fact would tend to show again a similar custom
among the Mayas and Egyptians, who, besides, placed with the body an
empty vase--symbol that the deceased had been judged and found
righteous.This vase, held between the hands of the statue of Chaacmol,
is also found held in the same manner by many other statues of
different individuals.It was customary with the Egyptians to deposit in
the tombs the implements of the trade or profession of the deceased.So
also with the Mayas--if a priest, they placed books; if a warrior, his
weapons; if a mechanic, the tools of his art,[TN-23]

The Egyptians adorned the tombs of the rich--which generally consisted
of one or two chambers--with sculptures and paintings reciting the names
and the history of the life of the personage to whom the tomb belonged.The mausoleum of Chaacmol, interiorly, was composed of three different
superposed apartments, with their floors of concrete well leveled,
polished and painted with yellow ochre; and exteriorly was adorned with
magnificent bas-reliefs, representing his totem and that of his
wife--dying warriors--the whole being surrounded by the image of a
feathered serpent--_Can_, his family name, whilst the walls of the two
apartments, or funeral chambers, in the monument raised to his memory,
were decorated with fresco paintings, representing not only Chaacmol's
own life, but the manners, customs, mode of dressing of his
contemporaries; as those of the different nations with which they were
in communication: distinctly recognizable by their type, stature and
other peculiarities.The portraits of the great and eminent men of his
time are sculptured on the jambs and lintels of the doors, represented
life-size.In Egypt it was customary to paint the sculptures, either on stone or
wood, with bright colors--yellow, blue, red, green predominating.In
Mayab the same custom prevailed, and traces of these colors are still
easily discernible on the sculptures; whilst they are still very
brilliant on the beautiful and highly polished stucco of the walls in
the rooms of certain monuments at Chichen-Itza.The Maya artists seem to
have used mostly vegetable colors; yet they also employed ochres as
pigments, and cinnabar--we having found such metallic colors in
Chaacmol's mausoleum.Le Plongeon still preserves some in her
possession.From where they procured it is more than we can tell at
present.The wives and daughters of the Egyptian kings and noblemen considered it
an honor to assist in the temples and religious ceremonies: one of their
principal duties being to play the sistrum.We find that in Yucatan, _Nicte_ (flower) the sister of _Chaacmol_,
assisted her elder brother, _Cay_, the pontiff, in the sanctuary, her
name being always associated with his in the inscriptions which adorn
the western facade of that edifice at Uxmal, as that of her sister,
_Mo_,[TN-24] is with Chaacmol's in some of the monuments at Chichen.Cogolludo, when speaking of the priestesses, _virgins of the sun_,
mentions a tradition that seems to refer to _Nicte_, stating that the
daughter of a king, who remained during all her life in the temple,
obtained after her death the honor of apotheosis, and was worshiped
under the name of _Zuhuy-Kak_ (the fire-virgin), and became the goddess
of the maidens, who were recommended to her care.As in Egypt, the kings and heroes were worshiped in Mayab after their
death; temples and pyramids being raised to their memory.Cogolludo
pretends that the lower classes adored fishes, snakes, tigers and other
abject animals, "even the devil himself, which appeared to them in
horrible forms" ("Historia de Yucatan," book IV., chap.Judging from the sculptures and mural paintings, the higher classes in
_Mayab_ wore, in very remote ages, dresses of quite an elaborate
character.Their under garment consisted of short trowsers, reaching the
middle of the thighs.At times these trowsers were highly ornamented
with embroideries and fringes, as they formed their only article of
clothing when at home; over these they wore a kind of kilt, very similar
to that used by the inhabitants of the Highlands in Scotland.It was
fastened to the waist with wide ribbons, tied behind in a knot forming a
large bow, the ends of which reached to the ankles.Their shoulders
were covered with a tippet falling to the elbows, and fastened on the
chest by means of a brooch.Their feet were protected by sandals, kept
in place by ropes or ribbons, passing between the big toe and the next,
and between the third and fourth, then brought up so as to encircle the
ankles.They were tied in front, forming a bow on the instep.Some wore
leggings, others garters and anklets made of feathers, generally yellow;
sometimes, however, they may have been of gold.Mary travelled to the office.Their head gears were of
different kinds, according to their rank and dignity.Warriors seem to
have used wide bands, tied behind the head with two knots, as we see in
the statue of Chaacmol, and in the bas-reliefs that adorn the queen's
chamber at Chichen.The king's coiffure was a peaked cap, that seems to
have served as model for the _pschent_, that symbol of domination over
the lower Egypt; with this difference, however, that in Mayab the point
formed the front, and in Egypt the back.The common people in Mayab, as in Egypt, were indeed little troubled by
their garments.These consisted merely of a simple girdle tied round the
loins, the ends falling before and behind to the middle of the thighs.Sometimes they also used the short trowsers; and, when at work, wrapped
a piece of cloth round their loins, long enough to cover their legs to
the knees.This costume was completed by wearing a square cloth, tied on
one of the shoulders by two of its corners.To-day
the natives of Yucatan wear the same dress, with but slight
modifications.While the aborigines of the _Tierra de Guerra_, who still
preserve the customs of their forefathers, untainted by foreign
admixture, use the same garments, of their own manufacture, that we see
represented in the bas-reliefs of Chichen and Uxmal, and in the mural
paintings of _Mayab_ and Egypt.Divination by the inspection of the entrails of victims, and the study
of omens were considered by the Egyptians as important branches of
learning.The soothsayers formed a respected order of the priesthood.From the mural paintings at Chichen, and from the works of the
chroniclers, we learn that the Mayas also had several manners of
consulting fate.One of the modes was by the inspection of the entrails
of victims; another by the manner of the cracking of the shell of a
turtle or armadillo by the action of fire, as among the Chinese.(In the
_Hong-fan_ or "the great and sublime doctrine," one of the books of the
_Chou-king_, the ceremonies of _Pou_ and _Chi_ are described at length).The Mayas had also their astrologers and prophets.Several prophecies,
purporting to have been made by their priests, concerning the preaching
of the Gospel among the people of Mayab, have reached us, preserved in
the works of Landa, Lizana, and Cogolludo.There we also read that, even
at the time of the Spanish conquest, they came from all parts of the
country, and congregated at the shrine of _Kinich-kakmo_, the deified
daughter of CAN, to listen to the oracles delivered by her through the
mouths of her priests and consult her on future events.By the
examination of the mural paintings, we know that _animal magnetism_ was
understood and practiced by the priests, who, themselves, seem to have
consulted clairvoyants.The learned priests of Egypt are said to have made considerable progress
in astronomical sciences.The _gnomon_, discovered by me in December, last year, in the ruined
city of Mayapan, would tend to prove that the learned men of Mayab were
not only close observers of the march of the celestial bodies and good
mathematicians; but that their attainments in astronomy were not
inferior to those of their brethren of Chaldea.Effectively the
construction of the gnomon shows that they had found the means of
calculating the latitude of places, that they knew the distance of the
solsticeal points from the equator; they had found that the greatest
angle of declination of the sun, 23 deg.27', occurred when that
luminary reached the tropics where, during nearly three days, said angle
of declination does not vary, for which reason they said that the _sun_
had arrived at his resting place.The Egyptians, it is said, in very remote ages, divided the year by
lunations, as the Mayas, who divided their civil year into eighteen
months, of twenty days, that they called U--moon--to which they added
five supplementary days, that they considered unlucky.From an epoch so
ancient that it is referred to the fabulous time of their history, the
Egyptians adopted the solar year, dividing it into twelve months, of
thirty days, to which they added, at the end of the last month, called
_Mesore_, five days, named _Epact_.By a most remarkable coincidence, the Egyptians, as the Mayas,
considered these additive five days _unlucky_.Besides this solar year they had a sideral or sothic year, composed of
365 days and 6 hours, which corresponds exactly to the Mayas[TN-25]
sacred year, that Landa tells us was also composed of 365 days and 6
hours; which they represented in the gnomon of Mayapan by the line that
joins the centers of the stela that forms it.The Egyptians, in their computations, calculated by a system of _fives_
and _tens_; the Mayas by a system of _fives_ and _twenties_, to four
hundred.Their sacred number appears to have been 13 from the remotest
antiquity, but SEVEN seems to have been a _mystic number_ among them as
among the Hindoos, Aryans, Chaldeans, Egyptians, and other nations.The Egyptians made use of a septenary system in the arrangement of the
grand gallery in the center of the great pyramid.Each side of the wall
is made of seven courses of finely polished stones, the one above
overlapping that below, thus forming the triangular ceiling common to
all the edifices in Yucatan.This gallery is said to be seven times the
height of the other passages, and, as all the rooms in Uxmal, Chichen
and other places in Mayab, it is seven-sided.Some authors pretend to
assume that this well marked septenary system has reference to the
_Pleiades_ or _Seven stars_._Alcyone_, the central star of the group,
being, it is said, on the same meridian as the pyramid, when it was
constructed, and _Alpha_ of Draconis, the then pole star, at its lower
culmination.Joseph A. Seiss and others pretend, the scientific
attainments required for the construction of such enduring monument
surpassed those of the learned men of Egypt, we must, of necessity,
believe that the architect who conceived the plan and carried out its
designs must have acquired his knowledge from an older people,
possessing greater learning than the priests of Memphis; unless we try
to persuade ourselves, as the reverend gentleman wishes us to, that the
great pyramid was built under the direct inspiration of the Almighty.Nearly all the monuments of Yucatan bear evidence that the Mayas had a
predilection for number SEVEN.Since we find that their artificial
mounds were composed of seven superposed platforms; that the city of
Uxmal contained seven of these mounds; that the north side of the palace
of King CAN was adorned with seven turrets; that the entwined serpents,
his totem, which adorn the east facade of the west wing of this
building, have seven rattles; that the head-dress of kings and queens
were adorned with seven blue feathers; in a word, that the number SEVEN
prevails in all places and in everything where Maya influence has
predominated.It is a FACT, and one that may not be altogether devoid of significance,
that this number SEVEN seems to have been the mystic number of many of
the nations of antiquity.It has even reached our times as such, being
used as symbol[TN-26] by several of the secret societies existing among
us.If we look back through the vista of ages to the dawn of civilized life
in the countries known as the _old world_, we find this number SEVEN
among the Asiatic nations as well as in Egypt and Mayab.Effectively, in
Babylon, the celebrated temple of _the seven lights_ was made of _seven_
stages or platforms.In the hierarchy of Mazdeism, the _seven marouts_,
or genii of the winds, the _seven amschaspands_; then among the Aryans
and their descendants, the _seven horses_ that drew the chariot of the
sun, the _seven apris_ or shape of the flame, the _seven rays_ of Agni,
the _seven manons_ or criators of the Vedas; among the Hebrews, the
_seven days_ of the creation, the _seven lamps_ of the ark and of
Zacharias's vision, the _seven branches_ of the golden candlestick, the
_seven days_ of the feast of the dedication of the temple of Solomon,
the _seven years_ of plenty, the _seven years_ of famine; in the
Christian dispensation, the _seven_ churches with the _seven_ angels at
their head, the _seven_ golden candlesticks, the _seven seals_ of the
book, the _seven_ trumpets of the angels, the _seven heads_ of the beast
that rose from the sea, the _seven vials_ full of the wrath of God, the
_seven_ last plagues of the Apocalypse; in the Greek mythology, the
_seven_ heads of the hydra, killed by Hercules, etc.The origin of the prevalence of that number SEVEN amongst all the
nations of earth, even the most remote from each other, has never been
satisfactorily explained, each separate people giving it a different
interpretation, according to their belief and to the tenets of their
religious creeds.As far as the Mayas are concerned, I think to have
found that it originated with the _seven_ members of CAN'S family, who
were the founders of the principal cities of _Mayab_, and to each of
whom was dedicated a mound in Uxmal and a turret in their palace.Their
names, according to the inscriptions carved on the monuments raised by
them at Uxmal and Chichen, were--CAN (serpent) and [C]OZ (bat), his
wife, from whom were born CAY (fish), the pontiff; AAK (turtle), who
became the governor of Uxmal; CHAACMOL (leopard), the warrior, who
became the husband of his sister MOO (macaw), the Queen of _Chichen_,
worshiped after her death at Izamal; and NICTE (flower), the priestess
who, under the name of _Zuhuy-Kuk_, became the goddess of the maidens.The Egyptians, in expressing their ideas in writing, used three
different kinds of characters--phonetic, ideographic and
symbolic--placed either in vertical columns or in horizontal lines, to
be read from right to left, from left to right, as indicated by the
position of the figures of men or animals.So, also, the Mayas in their
writings employed phonetic, symbolic and ideographic signs, combining
these often, forming monograms as we do to-day, placing them in such a
manner as best suited the arrangement of the ornamentation of the facade
of the edifices.At present we can only speak with certainty of the
monumental inscriptions, the books that fell in the hands of the
ecclesiastics at the time of the conquest having been destroyed.No
truly genuine written monuments of the Mayas are known to exist, except
those inclosed within the sealed apartments, where the priests and
learned men of MAYAB hid them from the _Nahualt_ or _Toltec_ invaders.As the Egyptians, they wrote in vertical columns and horizontal lines,
to be read generally from right to left.The space of this small essay
does not allow me to enter in more details; they belong naturally to a
work of different nature.Let it therefore suffice, for the present
purpose, to state that the comparative study of the language of the
Mayas led us to suspect that, as it contains words belonging to nearly
all the known languages of antiquity, and with exactly the same meaning,
in their mode of writing might be found letters or characters or signs
used in those tongues.Studying with attention the photographs made by
us of the inscriptions of Uxmal and Chichen, we were not long in
discovering that our surmises were indeed correct.The inscriptions,
written in squares or parallelograms, that might well have served as
models for the ancient hieratic Chaldeans, of the time of King Uruck,
seem to contain ancient Chaldee, Egyptian and Etruscan characters,
together with others that seem to be purely Mayab.Applying these known characters to the decipherment of the inscriptions,
giving them their accepted value, we soon found that the language in
which they are written is, in the main, the vernacular of the aborigines
of Yucatan and other parts of Central America to-day.Of course, the
original mother tongue having suffered some alterations, in consequence
of changes in customs induced by time, invasions, intercourse with other
nations, and the many other natural causes that are known to affect
man's speech.The Mayas and the Egyptians had many signs and characters identical;
possessing the same alphabetical and symbolical value in both nations.Among the symbolical, I may cite a few: _water_, _country or region_,
_king_, _Lord_, _offerings_, _splendor_, the _various emblems of the
sun_ and many others.Among the alphabetical, a very large number of the
so-called Demotic, by Egyptologists, are found even in the inscription
of the _Akab[c]ib_ at Chichen; and not a few of the most ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphs in the mural inscriptions at Uxmal.In these I have
been able to discover the Egyptian characters corresponding to our own.A a, B, C, CH or K, D, T, I, L, M, N, H, P, TZ, PP, U, OO, X, having the
same sound and value as in the Spanish language, with the exception of
the K, TZ, PP and X, which are pronounced in a way peculiar to the
Mayas.The inscriptions also contain these letters, A, I, X and PP
identical to the corresponding in the Etruscan alphabet.The finding of
the value of these characters has enabled me to decipher, among other
things, the names of the founders of the city of UXMAL; as that of the
city itself.This is written apparently in two different ways: whilst,
in fact, the sculptors have simply made use of two homophone signs,
notwithstanding dissimilar, of the letter M. As to the name of the
founders, not only are they written in alphabetical characters, but also
in ideographic, since they are accompanied in many instances by the
totems of the personages: e. g[TN-27] for AAK, which means turtle, is the
image of a turtle; for CAY (fish), the image of a fish; for Chaacmol
(leopard) the image of a leopard; and so on, precluding the possibility
of misinterpretation.Having found that the language of the inscriptions was Maya, of course
I had no difficulty in giving to each letter its proper phonetic value,
since, as I have already said, Maya is still the vernacular of the
people.I consider that the few facts brought together will suffice at present
to show, if nothing else, a strange similarity in the workings of the
mind in these two nations.But if these remarkable coincidences are not
merely freaks of hazard, we will be compelled to admit that one people
must have learned it from the other.Then will naturally arise the
questions, Which the teacher?The answer will not only
solve an ethnological problem, but decide the question of priority.I will now briefly refer to the myth of Osiris, the son of _Seb and
Nut_, the brother of _Aroeris_, the elder _Horus_, of _Typho_, of
_Isis_, and of _Nephthis_, named also NIKE.The authors have given
numerous explanations, result of fancy; of the mythological history of
that god, famous throughout Egypt.They made him a personification of
the inundations of the NILE; ISIS, his wife and sister, that of the
irrigated portion of the land of Egypt; their sister, _Nephthis_, that
of the barren edge of the desert occasionally fertilized by the waters
of the Nile; his brother and murderer _Tipho_, that of the sea which
swallows up the _Nile_.Leaving aside the mythical lores, with which the priests of all times
and all countries cajole the credulity of ignorant and superstitious
people, we find that among the traditions of the past, treasured in the
mysterious recesses of the temples, is a history of the life of Osiris
on Earth.Many wise men of our days have looked upon it as fabulous.I
am not ready to say whether it is or it is not; but this I can assert,
that, in many parts, it tallies marvelously with that of the culture
hero of the Mayas.It will be said, no doubt, that this remarkable similarity is a mere
coincidence.But how are we to dispose of so many coincidences?What
conclusion, if any, are we to draw from this concourse of so many
strange similes?In this case, I cannot do better than to quote, verbatim, from Sir
Gardner Wilkinson's work, chap.xiii:

     "_Osiris_, having become King of Egypt, applied himself towards
     civilizing his countrymen, by turning them from their former
     barbarous course of life, teaching them, moreover, to cultivate and
     improve the fruits of the earth.* * * * * With the same good
     disposition, he afterwards traveled over the rest of the world,
     inducing the people everywhere to submit to his discipline, by the
     mildest persuasion."The rest of the story relates to the manner of his killing by his
brother Typho, the disposal of his remains, the search instituted by his
wife to recover the body, how it was stolen again from her by _Typho_,
who cut him to pieces, scattering them over the earth, of the final
defeat of Typho by Osiris's son, Horus.Reading the description, above quoted, of the endeavors of Osiris to
civilize the world, who would not imagine to be perusing the traditions
of the deeds of the culture heroes _Kukulean_[TN-28] and Quetzalcoatl of
the Mayas and of the Aztecs?Osiris was particularly worshiped at Philo,
where the history of his life is curiously illustrated in the sculptures
of a small retired chamber, lying nearly over the western adytum of the
temple, just as that of Chaacmol in the mural paintings of his funeral
chamber, the bas-reliefs of what once was his mausoleum, in those of the
queen's chamber and of her box in the tennis court at Chichen."The mysteries of Osiris were divided into the greater and less
     mysteries.Before admission into the former, it was necessary that
     the initiated should have passed through all the gradations of the
     latter.But to merit this great honor, much was expected of the
     candidate, and many even of the priesthood were unable to obtain
     it.Besides the proofs of a virtuous life, other recommendations
     were required, and to be admitted to all the grades of the higher
     mysteries was the greatest honor to which any one could aspire.It
     was from these that the mysteries of Eleusis were borrowed."In Mayab there also existed mysteries, as proved by symbols discovered
in the month of June last by myself in the monument generally called the
_Dwarf's House_, at Uxmal.It seemed that the initiated had to pass
through different gradations to reach the highest or third; if we are to
judge by the number of rooms dedicated to their performance, and the
disposition of said rooms.The strangest part, perhaps, of this
discovery is the information it gives us that certain signs and symbols
were used by the affiliated, that are perfectly identical to those used
among the masons in their symbolical lodges.I have lately published in
_Harper's Weekly_, a full description of the building, with plans of the
same, and drawings of the signs and symbols existing in it.These secret
societies exist still among the _Zunis_ and other Pueblo Indians of New
Mexico, according to the relations of Mr.Frank H. Cushing, a gentleman
sent by the Smithsonian Institution to investigate their customs and
history.In order to comply with the mission intrusted to him, Mr.Cushing has caused his adoption in the tribe of the Zunis, whose
language he has learned, whose habits he has adopted.Among the other
remarkable things he has discovered is "the existence of twelve sacred
orders, with their priests and their secret rites as carefully guarded
as the secrets of freemasonry, an institution to which these orders have
a strange resemblance."If from Egypt we pass to Nubia, we find that the peculiar battle ax of
the Mayas was also used by the warriors of that country; whilst many of
the customs of the inhabitants of equatorial Africa, as described by Mr.DuChaillu[TN-29] in the relation of his voyage to the "Land of Ashango,"
so closely resemble those of the aborigines of Yucatan as to suggest
that intimate relations must have existed, in very remote ages, between
their ancestors; if the admixture of African blood, clearly discernible
still, among the natives of certain districts of the peninsula, did not
place that _fact_ without the peradventure of a doubt.We also see
figures in the mural paintings, at Chichen, with strongly marked African
features.We learned by the discovery of the statue of Chaacmol, and that of the
priestess found by me at the foot of the altar in front of the shrine
of _Ix-cuina_, the Maya Venus, situated at the south end of _Isla
Mugeres_, it was customary with persons of high rank to file their teeth
in sharp points like a saw.We read in the chronicles that this fashion
still prevailed after the Spanish conquest; and then by little and
little fell into disuse.Travelers tells us that it is yet in vogue
among many of the tribes in the interior of South America; particularly
those whose names seem to connect with the ancient Caribs or Carians.Du Chaillu asserts that the Ashangos, those of Otamo, the Apossos, the
Fans, and many other tribes of equatorial Africa, consider it a mark of
beauty to file their front teeth in a sharp point.He presents the Fans
as confirmed cannibals.We are told, and the bas-reliefs on Chaacmol's
mausoleum prove it, that the Mayas devoured the hearts of their fallen
enemies.It is said that, on certain grand occasions, after offering the
hearts of their victims to the idols, they abandoned the bodies to the
people, who feasted upon them.But it must be noticed that these
last-mentioned customs seemed to have been introduced in the country by
the Nahualts and Aztecs; since, as yet, we have found nothing in the
mural paintings to cause us to believe that the Mayas indulged in such
barbaric repasts, beyond the eating of their enemies' hearts.The Mayas were, and their descendants are still, confirmed believers in
witchcraft.In December, last year, being at the hacienda of
X-Kanchacan, where are situated the ruins of the ancient city of
Mayapan, a sick man was brought to me.He came most reluctantly, stating
that he knew what was the matter with him: that he was doomed to die
unless the spell was removed.He was emaciated, seemed to suffer from
malarial fever, then prevalent in the place, and from the presence of
tapeworm.I told him I could restore him to health if he would heed my
advice.The fellow stared at me for some time, trying to find out,
probably, if I was a stronger wizard than the _H-Men_ who had bewitched
him.He must have failed to discover on my face the proverbial
distinctive marks great sorcerers are said to possess; for, with an
incredulous grin, stretching his thin lips tighter over his teeth, he
simply replied: "No use--I am bewitched--there is no remedy for me."Du Chaillu, speaking of the superstitions of the inhabitants of
Equatorial Africa, says: "The greatest curse of the whole country is the
belief in sorcery or witchcraft.If the African is once possessed with
the belief that he is bewitched his whole nature seems to change.He
becomes suspicious of his dearest friends.He fancies himself sick, and
really often becomes sick through his fears.At least seventy-five per
cent of the deaths in all the tribes are murders for supposed sorcery."In that they differ from the natives of Yucatan, who respect wizards
because of their supposed supernatural powers.From the most remote antiquity, as we learn from the writings of the
chroniclers, in all sacred ceremonies the Mayas used to make copious
libations with _Balche_.To-day the aborigines still use it in the
celebrations of their ancient rites._Balche_ is a liquor made from the
bark of a tree called Balche, soaked in water, mixed with honey and left
to ferment.The nectar drank by
the God of Greek Mythology.Du Chaillu, speaking of the recovery to health of the King of _Mayo_lo,
a city in which he resided for some time, says: "Next day he was so much
elated with the improvement in his health that he got tipsy on a
fermented beverage which he had prepared two days before he had fallen
ill, and which he made by _mixing honey and water, and adding to it
pieces of bark of a certain tree_."(Journey to Ashango Land, page 183.)I will remark here that, by a strange _coincidence_, we not only find
that the inhabitants of Equatorial Africa have customs identical with
the MAYAS, but that the name of one of their cities MAYO_lo_, seems to
be a corruption of MAYAB.The Africans make offerings upon the graves of their departed friends,
where they deposit furniture, dress and food--and sometimes slay slaves,
men and women, over the graves of kings and chieftains, with the belief
that their spirits join that of him in whose honor they have been
sacrificed.I have already said that it was customary with the Mayas to place in the
tombs part of the riches of the deceased and the implements of his trade
or profession; and that the great quantity of blood found scattered
round the slab on which the statue of Chaacmol is reclining would tend
to suggest that slaves were sacrificed at his funeral.The Mayas of old were wont to abandon the house where a person had died.Many still observe that same custom when they can afford to do so; for
they believe that the spirit of the departed hovers round it.The Africans also abandon their houses, remove even the site of their
villages when death frequently occur;[TN-30] for, say they, the place is
no longer good; and they fear the spirits of those recently deceased.Among the musical instruments used by the Mayas there were two kinds of
drums--the _Tunkul_ and the _Zacatan_.They are still used by the
aborigines in their religious festivals and dances.The _Tunkul_ is a cylinder hollowed from the trunk of a tree, so as to
leave it about one inch in thickness all round.It is generally about
four feet in length.On one side two slits are cut, so as to leave
between them a strip of about four inches in width, to within six inches
from the ends; this strip is divided in the middle, across, so as to
form, as it were, tongues.It is by striking on those tongues with two
balls of india-rubber, attached to the end of sticks, that the
instrument is played.The volume of sound produced is so great that it
can be heard, is[TN-31] is said, at a distance of six miles in calm
weather.The _Zacatan_ is another sort of drum, also hollowed from the
trunk of a tree.On one end a piece of
skin is tightly stretched.It is by beating on the skin with the hand,
the instrument being supported between the legs of the drummer, in a
slanting position, that it is played.Du Chaillu, Stanley and other travelers in Africa tell us that, in case
of danger and to call the clans together, the big war drum is beaten,
and is heard many miles around.Du Chaillu asserts having seen one of
these _Ngoma_, formed of a hollow log, nine feet long, at Apono; and
describes a _Fan_ drum which corresponds to the _Zacatan_ of the Mayas
as follows: "The cylinder was about four feet long and ten inches in
diameter at one end, but only seven at the other.The wood was hollowed
out quite thin, and the skin stretched over tightly.To beat it the
drummer held it slantingly between his legs, and with two sticks
beats[TN-32] furiously upon the upper, which was the larger end of the
cylinder."We have the counterpart of the fetish houses, containing the skulls of
the ancestors and some idol or other, seen by Du Chaillu, in African
towns, in the small huts constructed at the entrance of all the villages
in Yucatan.These huts or shrines contain invariably a crucifix; at
times the image of some saint, often a skull.The last probably to cause
the wayfarer to remember he has to die; and that, as he cannot carry
with him his worldly treasures on the other side of the grave, he had
better deposit some in the alms box firmly fastened at the foot of the
cross.Cogolludo informs us these little shrines were anciently
dedicated to the god of lovers, of histrions, of dancers, and an
infinity of small idols that were placed at the entrance of the
villages, roads and staircases of the temples and other parts.Even the breed of African dogs seems to be the same as that of the
native dogs of Yucatan.Were I to describe these I could not make use of
more appropriate words than the following of Du Chaillu: "The pure bred
native dog is small, has long straight ears, long muzzle and long curly
tail; the hair is short and the color yellowish; the pure breed being
known by the clearness of his color.They are always lean, and are kept
very short of food by their owners.* * * Although they have quick ears;
I don't think highly of their scent.I could continue this list of similes, but methinks those already
mentioned as sufficient for the present purpose.I will therefore close
it by mentioning this strange belief that Du Chaillu asserts exists
among the African warriors: "_The charmed leopard's skin worn about the
warrior's middle is supposed to render that worthy spear-proof._"

Let us now take a brief retrospective glance at the FACTS mentioned in
the foregoing pages.They seem to teach us that, in ages so remote as to
be well nigh lost in the abyss of the past, the _Mayas_ were a great and
powerful nation, whose people had reached a high degree of civilization.That it is impossible for us to form a correct idea of their
attainments, since only the most enduring monuments, built by them, have
reached us, resisting the disintegrating action of time and atmosphere.That, as the English of to-day, they had colonies all over the earth;
for we find their name, their traditions, their customs and their
language scattered in many distant countries, among whose inhabitants
they apparently exercised considerable civilizing influence, since they
gave names to their gods, to their tribes, to their cities.We cannot doubt that the colonists carried with them the old traditions
of the mother country, and the history of the founders of their
nationality; since we find them in the countries where they seem to have
established large settlements soon after leaving the land of their
birth.In course of time these traditions have become disfigured,
wrapped, as it were, in myths, creations of fanciful and untutored
imaginations, as in Hindostan: or devises of crafty priests, striving to
hide the truth from the ignorant mass of the people, fostering their
superstitions, in order to preserve unbounded and undisputed sway over
them, as in Egypt.In Hindostan, for example, we find the Maya custom of carrying the
children astride on the hips of the nurses.That of recording the vow of
the devotees, or of imploring the blessings of deity by the imprint of
the hand, dipped in red liquid, stamped on the walls of the shrines and
palaces.The worship of the mastodon, still extant in India, Siam,
Burmah, as in the worship of _Ganeza_, the god of knowledge, with an
elephant head, degenerated in that of the elephant itself.Still extant we find likewise the innate propensity of the Mayas to
exclude all foreigners from their country; even to put to death those
who enter their territories (as do, even to-day, those of Santa Cruz and
the inhabitants of the Tierra de Guerra) as the emissaries of Rama were
informed by the friend of the owner of the country, the widow of the
_great architect_, MAYA, whose name HEMA means in the Maya language "she
who places ropes across the roads to impede the passage."Even the
history of the death of her husband MAYA, killed with a thunderbolt, by
the god _Pourandara_, whose jealousy was aroused by his love for her and
their marriage, recalls that of _Chaacmol_, the husband of _Moo_, killed
by their brother Aac, by being stabbed by him three times in the back
with a spear, through jealousy--for he also loved _Moo_.Some Maya tribes, after a time, probably left their home at the South of
Hindostan and emigrated to Afghanistan, where their descendants still
live and have villages on the North banks of the river _Kabul_.They
left behind old traditions, that they may have considered as mere
fantasies of their poets, and other customs of their forefathers.Yet we
know so little about the ancient Afghans, or the Maya tribes living
among them, that it is impossible at present to say how much, if any,
they have preserved of the traditions of their race.All we know for a
certainty is that many of the names of their villages and tribes are
pure American-Maya words: that their types are very similar to the
features of the bearded men carved on the pillars of the castle, and on
the walls of other edifices at Chichen-Itza: while their warlike habits
recall those of the Mayas, who fought so bravely and tenaciously the
Spanish invaders.Some of the Maya tribes, traveling towards the west and northwest,
reached probably the shores of Ethiopia; while others, entering the
Persian Gulf, landed near the embouchure of the Euphrates, and founded
their primitive capital at a short distance from it.They called it _Hur
(Hula) city of guests just arrived_--and according to Berosus gave
themselves the name of _Khaldi_; probably because they intrenched their
city: _Kal_ meaning intrenchment in the American-Maya language.We have
seen that the names of all the principal deities of the primitive
Chaldeans had a natural etymology in that tongue.Such strange
coincidences cannot be said to be altogether accidental.Particularly
when we consider that their learned men were designated as MAGI, (Mayas)
and their Chief _Rab-Mag_, meaning, in Maya, the _old man_; and were
great architects, mathematicians and astronomers.As again we know of
them but imperfectly, we cannot tell what traditions they had preserved
of the birthplace of their forefathers.But by the inscriptions on the
tablets or bricks, found at Mugheir and Warka, we know for a certainty
that, in the archaic writings, they formed their characters of straight
lines of uniform thickness; and inclosed their sentences in squares or
parallelograms, as did the founders of the ruined cities of Yucatan.And
from the signet cylinder of King Urukh, that their mode of dressing was
identical with that of many personages represented in the mural
paintings at Chichen-Itza.We have traced the MAYAS again on the shores of Asia Minor, where the
CARIANS at last established themselves, after having spread terror among
the populations bordering on the Mediterranean.Their origin is unknown:
but their customs were so similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan
at the time even of the Spanish conquest--and their names CAR, _Carib_
or _Carians_, so extensively spread over the western continent, that we
might well surmise, that, navigators as they were, they came from those
parts of the world; particularly when we are told by the Greek poets and
historians, that the goddess MAIA was the daughter of _Atlantis_.We
have seen that the names of the khati, those of their cities, that of
Tyre, and finally that of Egypt, have their etymology in the Maya.Considering the numerous coincidences already pointed out, and many more
I could bring forth, between the attainments and customs of the Mayas
and the Egyptians; in view also of the fact that the priests and learned
men of Egypt constantly pointed toward the WEST as the birthplace of
their ancestors, it would seem as if a colony, starting from Mayab, had
emigrated Eastward, and settled on the banks of the Nile; just as the
Chinese to-day, quitting their native land and traveling toward the
rising sun, establish themselves in America.In Egypt again, as in Hindostan, we find the history of the children of
CAN, preserved among the secret traditions treasured up by the priests
in the dark recesses of their temples: the same story, even with all its
details.It is TYPHO who kills his brother OSIRIS, the husband of their
sister ISIS.Some of the names only have been changed when the members
of the royal family of CAN, the founder of the cities of Mayab, reaching
apotheosis, were presented to the people as gods, to be worshiped.That the story of _Isis_ and _Osiris_ is a mythical account of CHAACMOL
and MOO, from all the circumstances connected with it, according to the
relations of the priests of Egypt that tally so closely with what we
learn in Chichen-Itza from the bas-reliefs, it seems impossible to
doubt.Effectively, _Osiris_ and _Isis_ are considered as king and queen of the
Amenti--the region of the West--the mansion of the dead, of the
ancestors.Whatever may be the etymology of the name of Osiris, it is a
_fact_, that in the sculptures he is often represented with a spotted
skin suspended near him, and Diodorus Siculus says: "That the skin is
usually represented without the head; but some instances where this is
introduced show it to be the _leopard's_ or _panther's_."Again, the
name of Osiris as king of the West, of the Amenti, is always written, in
hieroglyphic characters, representing a crouching _leopard_ with an eye
above it.It is also well known that the priests of Osiris wore a
_leopard_ skin as their ceremonial dress.Now, Chaacmol reigned with his sister Moo, at Chichen-Itza, in Mayab, in
the land of the West for Egypt.The name _Chaacmol_ means, in Maya, a
_Spotted_ tiger, a _leopard_; and he is represented as such in all his
totems in the sculptures on the monuments; his shield being made of the
skin of leopard, as seen in the mural paintings.Osiris, in Egypt, is a myth.Chaacmol, in Mayab, a reality.A warrior
whose mausoleum I have opened; whose weapons and ornaments of jade are
in Mrs.Le Plongeon's possession; whose heart I have found, and sent a
piece of it to be analysed by professor Thompson of Worcester, Mass.;
whose effigy, with his name inscribed on the tablets occupying the place
of the ears, forms now one of the most precious relics in the National
Museum of Mexico.As to the etymology of her name
the Maya affords it in I[C]IN--_the younger sister_.As Queen of the
Amenti, of the West, she also is represented in hieroglyphs by the same
characters as her husband--a _leopard, with an eye above_, and the sign
of the feminine gender an oval or egg.But as a goddess she is always
portrayed with wings; the vulture being dedicated to her; and, as it
were, her totem.MOO the wife and sister of _Chaacmol_ was the Queen of Chichen.She is
represented on the Mausoleum of Chaacmol as a _Macaw_ (Moo in the Maya
language); also on the monuments at Uxmal: and the chroniclers tell us
that she was worshiped in Izamal under the name of _Kinich-Kakmo_;
reading from right to left the _fiery macaw with eyes like the sun_.Their protecting spirit is a _Serpent_, the totem of their father CAN.Another Egyptian divinity, _Apap_ or _Apop_, is represented under the
form of a gigantic serpent covered with wounds.Plutarch in his
treatise, _De Iside et Osiride_, tells us that he was enemy to the sun.TYPHO was the brother of Osiris and Isis; for jealousy, and to usurp the
throne, he formed a conspiration and killed his brother.He is said to
represent in the Egyptian mythology, the sea, by some; by others, _the
sun_.AAK (turtle) was also the brother of Chaacmol and _Moo_.For jealousy,
and to usurp the throne, he killed his brother at treason with three
thrusts of his _spear_ in the back.Around the belt of his statue at
Uxmal used to be seen hanging the heads of his brothers CAY and
CHAACMOL, together with that of MOO; whilst his feet rested on their
flayed bodies.In the sculpture he is pictured surrounded by the _Sun_
as his protecting spirit.The escutcheon of Uxmal shows that he called
the place he governed the land of the Sun.In the bas-reliefs of the
Queen's chamber at Chichen his followers are seen to render homage to
the _Sun_; others, the friends of MOO, to the _Serpent_.So, in Mayab as
in Egypt, the _Sun_ and _Serpent_ were inimical.In Egypt again this
enmity was a myth, in Mayab a reality.AROERIS was the brother of Osiris, Isis and Typho.His business seems to
have been that of a peace-maker.CAY was also the brother of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_ and _Aac_.He was the high
pontiff, and sided with Chaacmol and Moo in their troubles, as we learn
from the mural paintings, from his head and flayed body serving as
trophy to Aac as I have just said.In June last, among the ruins of _Uxmal_, I discovered a magnificent
bust of this personage; and I believe I know the place where his remains
are concealed.NEPHTHIS was the sister of Isis, Osiris, Typho, and Aroeris, and the
wife of Typho; but being in love with Osiris she managed to be taken to
his embraces, and she became pregnant.That intrigue having been
discovered by Isis, she adopted the child that Nephthis, fearing the
anger of her husband, had hidden, brought him up as her own under the
name of Anubis.Nephthis was also called NIKE by some.NIC or NICTE was the sister of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_, _Aac_, and _Cay_, with
whose name I find always her name associated in the sculptures on the
monuments.Here the analogy between these personages would seem to
differ, still further study of the inscriptions may yet prove the
Egyptian version to contain some truth._Nic_ or _Nicte_[TN-33] means
flower; a cast of her face, with a flower sculptured on one cheek,
exists among my collections.We are told that three children were born to Isis and Osiris: Horus,
Macedo, and Harpocrates.Well, in the scene painted on the walls of
Chaacmol's funeral chamber, in which the body of this warrior is
represented stretched on the ground, cut open under the ribs for the
extraction of the heart and visceras, he is seen surrounded by his wife,
his sister NIC, his mother _Zo[c]_, and four children.I will close these similes by mentioning that _Thoth_ was reputed the
preceptor of Isis; and said to be the inventor of letters, of the art of
reckoning, geometry, astronomy, and is represented in the hieroglyphs
under the form of a baboon (cynocephalus).He is one of the most ancient
divinities among the Egyptians.He had also the office of scribe in the
lower regions, where he was engaged in noting down the actions of the
dead, and presenting or reading them to Osiris.One of the modes of
writing his name in hieroglyphs, transcribed in our common letters,
reads _Nukta_; a word most appropriate and suggestive of his attributes,
since, according to the Maya language, it would signify to understand,
to perceive, _Nuctah_: while his name Thoth, maya[TN-34] _thot_ means to
scatter flowers; hence knowledge.In the temple of death at Uxmal, at
the foot of the grand staircase that led to the sanctuary, at the top of
which I found a sacrificial altar, there were six cynocephali in a
sitting posture, as Thoth is represented by the Egyptians.They were
placed three in a row each side of the stairs.Between them was a
platform where a skeleton, in a kneeling posture, used to be.To-day the
cynocephali have been removed.They are in one of the yard[TN-35] of the
principal house at the Hacienda of Uxmal.The statue representing the
kneeling skeleton lays, much defaced, where it stood when that ancient
city was in its glory.In the mural paintings at Chichen-Itza, we again find the baboon
(Cynocephalus) warning Moo of impending danger.She is pictured in her
home, which is situated in the midst of a garden, and over which is seen
the royal insignia.A basket, painted blue, full of bright oranges, is
symbolical of her domestic happiness.Before
her is an individual pictured physically deformed, to show the ugliness
of his character and by the flatness of his skull, want of moral
qualities, (the[TN-36] proving that the learned men of Mayab understood
phrenology).He is in an persuasive attitude; for he has come to try to
seduce her in the name of another.She rejects his offer: and, with her
extended hand, protects the armadillo, on whose shell the high priest
read her destiny when yet a child.In a tree, just above the head of the
man, is an ape.His hand is open and outstretched, both in a warning and
threatening position.A serpent (_can_), her protecting spirit, is seen
at a short distance coiled, ready to spring in her defense.Near by is
another serpent, entwined round the trunk of a tree.He has wounded
about the head another animal, that, with its mouth open, its tongue
protruding, looks at its enemy over its shoulder.Blood is seen oozing
from its tongue and face.This picture forcibly recalls to the mind the
myth of the garden of Eden.For here we have the garden, the fruit, the
woman, the tempter.As to the charmed _leopard_ skin worn by the African warriors to render
them invulnerable to spears, it would seem as if the manner in which
Chaacmol met his death, by being stabbed with a spear, had been known
to their ancestors; and that they, in their superstitious fancies, had
imagined that by wearing his totem, it would save them from being
wounded with the same kind of weapon used in killing him.Let us not
laugh at such a singular conceit among uncivilized tribes, for it still
prevails in Europe.On many of the French and German soldiers, killed
during the last German war, were found talismans composed of strips of
paper, parchment or cloth, on which were written supposed cabalistic
words or the name of some saint, that the wearer firmly believed to be
possessed of the power of making him invulnerable.I am acquainted with many people--and not ignorant--who believe that by
wearing on their persons rosaries, made in Jerusalem and blessed by the
Pope, they enjoy immunity from thunderbolts, plagues, epidemics and
other misfortunes to which human flesh is heir.That the Mayas were a race autochthon on this western continent and did
not receive their civilization from Asia or Africa, seems a rational
conclusion, to be deduced from the foregoing FACTS.If we had nothing
but their _name_ to prove it, it should be sufficient, since its
etymology is only to be found in the American Maya language.They cannot be said to have been natives of Hindostan; since we are told
that, in very remote ages, _Maya_, a prince of the Davanas, established
himself there.We do not find the etymology of his name in any book
where mention is made of it.We are merely told that he was a wise
magician, a great architect, a learned astronomer, a powerful Asoura
(demon), thirsting for battles and bloodshed: or, according to the
Sanscrit, a Goddess, the mother of all beings that exist--gods and men.Very little is known of the Mayas of Afghanistan, except that they call
themselves _Mayas_, and that the names of their tribes and cities are
words belonging to the American Maya language.Who can give the etymology of the name _Magi_, the learned men amongst
the Chaldees.We only know that its meaning is the same as _Maya_ in
Hindostan: magician, astronomer, learned man.If we come to Greece,
where we find again the name _Maia_, it is mentioned as that of a
goddess, as in Hindostan, the mother of the gods: only we are told that
she was the daughter of Atlantis--born of Atlantis.But if we come to
the lands beyond the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then we find a
country called MAYAB, on account of the porosity of its soil; that, as a
sieve (_Mayab_), absorbs the water in an incredibly short time.Its
inhabitants took its name from that of the country, and called
themselves _Mayas_.It is a fact worthy of notice, that in their
hieroglyphic writings the sign employed by the Egyptians to signify a
_Lord_, a _Master_, was the image of a sieve.Would not this seem to
indicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants
of the valley of the Nile, and became the lords and masters of the land,
were people from MAYAB; particularly if we consider that the usual
character used to write the name of Egypt was the sieve, together with
the sign of land?We know that the _Mayas_ deified and paid divine honors to their eminent
men and women after their death.This worship of their heroes they
undoubtedly carried, with other customs, to the countries where they
emigrated; and, in due course of time, established it among their
inhabitants, who came to forget that MAYAB was a locality, converted it
in to a personalty: and as some of their gods came from it, Maya was
considered as the _Mother of the Gods_, as we see in Hindostan and
Greece.It would seem probable that the Mayas did not receive their civilization
from the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas, for the religious lores
and customs they have in common are too few to justify this assertion.They would simply tend to prove that relations had existed between them
at some epoch or other; and had interchanged some of their habits and
beliefs as it happens, between the civilized nations of our days.This
appears to be the true side of the question; for in the figures
sculptured on the obelisks of Copan the Asiatic type is plainly
discernible; whilst the features of the statues that adorn the
celebrated temples of Hindostan are, beyond all doubts, American.The FACTS gathered from the monuments do not sustain the theory advanced
by many, that the inhabitants of tropical America received their
civilization from Egypt and Asia Minor.It is true that
I have shown that many of the customs and attainments of the Egyptians
were identical to those of the Mayas; but these had many religious rites
and habits unknown to the Egyptians; who, as we know, always pointed
towards the West as the birthplaces of their ancestors, and worshiped as
gods and goddesses personages who had lived, and whose remains are still
in MAYAB.Besides, the monuments themselves prove the respective
antiquity of the two nations.According to the best authorities the most ancient monuments raised by
the Egyptians do not date further back than about 2,500 years B. C.
Well, in Ake, a city about twenty-five miles from Merida, there exists
still a monument sustaining thirty-six columns of _katuns_.Each of
these columns indicate a lapse of one hundred and sixty years in the
life of the nation.They then would show that 5,760 years has intervened
between the time when the first stone was placed on the east corner of
the uppermost of the three immense superposed platforms that compose the
structure, and the placing of the last capping stone on the top of the
thirty-sixth column.How long did that event occur before the Spanish
conquest it is impossible to surmise.Supposing, however, it did take
place at that time; this would give us a lapse of at least 6,100 years
since, among the rejoicings of the people this sacred monument being
finished, the first stone that was to serve as record of the age of the
nation, was laid by the high priest, where we see it to-day.I will
remark that the name AKE is one of the Egyptians' divinities, the third
person of the triad of Esneh; always represented as a child, holding his
finger to his mouth.To-day the meaning of the
word is lost in Yucatan.Cogolludo, in his history of Yucatan, speaking of the manner in which
they computed time, says:

"They counted their ages and eras, which they inscribed in their books
every twenty years, in lustrums of four years.* * * When five of these
lustrums were completed, they called the lapse of twenty years _katun_,
which means to place a stone down upon another.* * * In certain sacred
buildings and in the houses of the priests every twenty years they place
a hewn stone upon those already there.When seven of these stones have
thus been piled one over the other began the _Ahau katun_.Then after
the first lustrum of four years they placed a small stone on the top of
the big one, commencing at the east corner; then after four years more
they placed another small stone on the west corner; then the next at the
north; and the fourth at the south.At the end of the twenty years they
put a big stone on the top of the small ones: and the column, thus
finished, indicated a lapse of one hundred and sixty years."There are other methods for determining the approximate age of the
monuments of Mayab:

1st.By means of their actual orientation; starting from the _fact_ that
their builders always placed either the faces or angles of the edifices
fronting the cardinal points.By determining the epoch when the mastodon became extinct.For,
since _Can_ or his ancestors adopted the head of that animal as symbol
of deity, it is evident they must have known it; hence, must have been
contemporary with it.By determining when, through some great cataclysm, the lands became
separated, and all communications between the inhabitants of _Mayab_ and
their colonies were consequently interrupted.If we are to credit what
Psenophis and Sonchis, priests of Heliopolis and Sais, said to Solon
"that nine thousand years before, the visit to them of the Athenian
legislator, in consequence of great earthquakes and inundations, the
lands of the West disappeared in one day and a fatal night," then we may
be able to form an idea of the antiquity of the ruined cities of America
and their builders.Reader, I have brought before you, without comments, some of the FACTS,
that after ten years of research, the paintings on the walls of
_Chaacmol's_ funeral chamber, the sculptured inscriptions carved on the
stones of the crumbling monuments of Yucatan, and a comparative study of
the vernacular of the aborigines of that country, have revealed to us.Many years of further patient investigations,
the full interpretation of the monumental inscriptions, and, above all,
the possession of the libraries of the learned men of _Mayab_, are the
_sine qua non_ to form an uncontrovertible one, free from the
speculations which invalidate all books published on the subject
heretofore.If by reading these pages you have learned something new, your time has
not been lost; nor mine in writing them.Transcriber's Note

part of the covenanted testimony of the Church, if they expected a
blessing on their arms and their cause; and that, in their eyes, a
lukewarm Presbyterian was little better than a Prelatist, an
Anti-Covenanter, and a Nullifidian.The parties accused repelled the charge of criminal compliance and
defection from the truth with scorn and indignation, and charged their
accusers with breach of faith, as well as with wrong-headed and
extravagant zeal in introducing such divisions into an army, the joint
strength of which could not, by the most sanguine, be judged more than
sufficient to face their enemies.Poundtext, and one or two others, made
some faint efforts to stem the increasing fury of the factious,
exclaiming to those of the other party, in the words of the
Patriarch,--"Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee,
and between thy herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we be brethren."No
pacific overture could possibly obtain audience.It was in vain that
even Burley himself, when he saw the dissension proceed to such ruinous
lengths, exerted his stern and deep voice, commanding silence and
obedience to discipline.The spirit of insubordination had gone forth,
and it seemed as if the exhortation of Habakkuk Mucklewrath had
communicated a part of his frenzy to all who heard him.The wiser, or
more timid part of the assembly, were already withdrawing themselves
from the field, and giving up their cause as lost.Others were
moderating a harmonious call, as they somewhat improperly termed it, to
new officers, and dismissing those formerly chosen, and that with a
tumult and clamour worthy of the deficiency of good sense and good order
implied in the whole transaction.It was at this moment when Morton
arrived in the field and joined the army, in total confusion, and on the
point of dissolving itself.His arrival occasioned loud exclamations of
applause on the one side, and of imprecation on the other."What means this ruinous disorder at such a moment?"he exclaimed to
Burley, who, exhausted with his vain exertions to restore order, was now
leaning on his sword, and regarding the confusion with an eye of resolute
despair."It means," he replied, "that God has delivered us into the hands of our
enemies.""Not so," answered Morton, with a voice and gesture which compelled many
to listen; "it is not God who deserts us, it is we who desert him, and
dishonour ourselves by disgracing and betraying the cause of freedom and
religion.--Hear me," he exclaimed, springing to the pulpit which
Mucklewrath had been compelled to evacuate by actual exhaustion--"I bring
from the enemy an offer to treat, if you incline to lay down your arms.I
can assure you the means of making an honourable defence, if you are of
more manly tempers.Let us resolve either for
peace or war; and let it not be said of us in future days, that six
thousand Scottish men in arms had neither courage to stand their ground
and fight it out, nor prudence to treat for peace, nor even the coward's
wisdom to retreat in good time and with safety.What signifies
quarrelling on minute points of church-discipline, when the whole edifice
is threatened with total destruction?O, remember, my brethren, that the
last and worst evil which God brought upon the people whom he had once
chosen--the last and worst punishment of their blindness and hardness of
heart, was the bloody dissensions which rent asunder their city, even
when the enemy were thundering at its gates!"Some of the audience testified their feeling of this exhortation, by loud
exclamations of applause; others by hooting, and exclaiming--"To your
tents, O Israel!"Morton, who beheld the columns of the enemy already beginning to appear
on the right bank, and directing their march upon the bridge, raised his
voice to its utmost pitch, and, pointing at the same time with his hand,
exclaimed,--"Silence your senseless clamours, yonder is the enemy!On
maintaining the bridge against him depend our lives, as well as our hope
to reclaim our laws and liberties.--There shall at least one Scottishman
die in their defence.--Let any one who loves his country follow me!"The multitude had turned their heads in the direction to which he
pointed.The sight of the glittering files of the English Foot-Guards,
supported by several squadrons of horse, of the cannon which the
artillerymen were busily engaged in planting against the bridge, of the
plaided clans who seemed to search for a ford, and of the long succession
of troops which were destined to support the attack, silenced at once
their clamorous uproar, and struck them with as much consternation as if
it were an unexpected apparition, and not the very thing which they ought
to have been looking out for.They gazed on each other, and on their
leaders, with looks resembling those that indicate the weakness of a
patient when exhausted by a fit of frenzy.Yet when Morton, springing
from the rostrum, directed his steps towards the bridge, he was followed
by about an hundred of the young men who were particularly attached to
his command.Burley turned to Macbriar--"Ephraim," he said, "it is Providence points
us the way, through the worldly wisdom of this latitudinarian youth.--He
that loves the light, let him follow Burley!""Tarry," replied Macbriar; "it is not by Henry Morton, or such as he,
that our goings-out and our comings-in are to be meted; therefore tarry
with us.I fear treachery to the host from this nullifidian Achan--Thou
shalt not go with him.Thou art our chariots and our horsemen.""Hinder me not," replied Burley; "he hath well said that all is lost, if
the enemy win the bridge--therefore let me not.Shall the children of
this generation be called wiser or braver than the children of the
sanctuary?--Array yourselves under your leaders--let us not lack supplies
of men and ammunition; and accursed be he who turneth back from the work
on this great day!"Having thus spoken, he hastily marched towards the bridge, and was
followed by about two hundred of the most gallant and zealous of his
party.There was a deep and disheartened pause when Morton and Burley
departed.The commanders availed themselves of it to display their lines
in some sort of order, and exhorted those who were most exposed to throw
themselves upon their faces to avoid the cannonade which they might
presently expect.The insurgents ceased to resist or to remonstrate; but
the awe which had silenced their discords had dismayed their courage.They suffered themselves to be formed into ranks with the docility of a
flock of sheep, but without possessing, for the time, more resolution or
energy; for they experienced a sinking of the heart, imposed by the
sudden and imminent approach of the danger which they had neglected to
provide against while it was yet distant.They were, however, drawn out
with some regularity; and as they still possessed the appearance of an
army, their leaders had only to hope that some favourable circumstance
would restore their spirits and courage.Kettledrummle, Poundtext, Macbriar, and other preachers, busied
themselves in their ranks, and prevailed on them to raise a psalm.But
the superstitious among them observed, as an ill omen, that their song of
praise and triumph sunk into "a quaver of consternation," and resembled
rather a penitentiary stave sung on the scaffold of a condemned criminal,
than the bold strain which had resounded along the wild heath of
Loudon-hill, in anticipation of that day's victory.The melancholy melody
soon received a rough accompaniment; the royal soldiers shouted, the
Highlanders yelled, the cannon began to fire on one side, and the
musketry on both, and the bridge of Bothwell, with the banks adjacent,
were involved in wreaths of smoke.As e'er ye saw the rain doun fa',
                    Or yet the arrow from the bow,
                    Sae our Scots lads fell even down,
                    And they lay slain on every knowe.Ere Morton or Burley had reached the post to be defended, the enemy had
commenced an attack upon it with great spirit.The two regiments of
Foot-Guards, formed into a close column, rushed forward to the river; one
corps, deploying along the right bank, commenced a galling fire on the
defenders of the pass, while the other pressed on to occupy the bridge.The insurgents sustained the attack with great constancy and courage; and
while part of their number returned the fire across the river, the rest
maintained a discharge of musketry upon the further end of the bridge
itself, and every avenue by which the soldiers endeavoured to approach
it.The latter suffered severely, but still gained ground, and the head
of their column was already upon the bridge, when the arrival of Morton
changed the scene; and his marksmen, commencing upon the pass a fire as
well aimed as it was sustained and regular, compelled the assailants to
retire with much loss.They were a second time brought up to the charge,
and a second time repulsed with still greater loss, as Burley had now
brought his party into action.The fire was continued with the utmost
vehemence on both sides, and the issue of the action seemed very dubious.Monmouth, mounted on a superb white charger, might be discovered on the
top of the right bank of the river, urging, entreating, and animating the
exertions of his soldiers.By his orders, the cannon, which had hitherto
been employed in annoying the distant main body of the presbyterians,
were now turned upon the defenders of the bridge.But these tremendous
engines, being wrought much more slowly than in modern times, did not
produce the effect of annoying or terrifying the enemy to the extent
proposed.The insurgents, sheltered by copsewood along the bank of the
river, or stationed in the houses already mentioned, fought under cover,
while the royalists, owing to the precautions of Morton, were entirely
exposed.The defence was so protracted and obstinate, that the royal
generals began to fear it might be ultimately successful.While Monmouth
threw himself from his horse, and, rallying the Foot-Guards, brought them
on to another close and desperate attack, he was warmly seconded
by Dalzell, who, putting himself at the head of a body of
Lennox-Highlanders, rushed forward with their tremendous war-cry of
Loch-sloy.[Note: This was the slogan or war-cry of the MacFarlanes, taken from
     a lake near the head of Loch Lomond, in the centre of their ancient
     possessions on the western banks of that beautiful inland sea.]The ammunition of the defenders of the bridge began to fail at this
important crisis; messages, commanding and imploring succours and
supplies, were in vain dispatched, one after the other, to the main body
of the presbyterian army, which remained inactively drawn up on the open
fields in the rear.Fear, consternation, and misrule, had gone abroad
among them, and while the post on which their safety depended required
to be instantly and powerfully reinforced, there remained none either to
command or to obey.As the fire of the defenders of the bridge began to slacken, that of the
assailants increased, and in its turn became more fatal.Animated by the
example and exhortations of their generals, they obtained a footing upon
the bridge itself, and began to remove the obstacles by which it was
blockaded.The portal-gate was broke open, the beams, trunks of trees,
and other materials of the barricade, pulled down and thrown into the
river.Morton and Burley
fought in the very front of their followers, and encouraged them with
their pikes, halberds, and partisans, to encounter the bayonets of the
Guards, and the broadswords of the Highlanders.But those behind the
leaders began to shrink from the unequal combat, and fly singly, or in
parties of two or three, towards the main body, until the remainder were,
by the mere weight of the hostile column as much as by their weapons,
fairly forced from the bridge.The passage being now open, the enemy
began to pour over.But the bridge was long and narrow, which rendered
the manoeuvre slow as well as dangerous; and those who first passed had
still to force the houses, from the windows of which the Covenanters
continued to fire.Burley and Morton were near each other at this
critical moment."There is yet time," said the former, "to bring down horse to attack
them, ere they can get into order; and, with the aid of God, we may thus
regain the bridge--hasten thou to bring them down, while I make the
defence good with this old and wearied body."Morton saw the importance of the advice, and, throwing himself on the
horse which cuddie held in readiness for him behind the thicket, galloped
towards a body of cavalry which chanced to be composed entirely of
Cameronians.Ere he could speak his errand, or utter his orders, he was
saluted by the execrations of the whole body.they exclaimed--"the cowardly traitor flies like a hart from
the hunters, and hath left valiant Burley in the midst of the slaughter!""I come to lead you to the attack.Advance
boldly, and we shall yet do well."--such were the tumultuous exclamations
which resounded from the ranks;--"he hath sold you to the sword of the
enemy!"And while Morton argued, entreated, and commanded in vain, the moment was
lost in which the advance might have been useful; and the outlet from the
bridge, with all its defences, being in complete possession of the enemy,
Burley and his remaining followers were driven back upon the main body,
to whom the spectacle of their hurried and harassed retreat was far from
restoring the confidence which they so much wanted.In the meanwhile, the forces of the King crossed the bridge at their
leisure, and, securing the pass, formed in line of battle; while
Claverhouse, who, like a hawk perched on a rock, and eyeing the time to
pounce on its prey, had watched the event of the action from the opposite
bank, now passed the bridge at the head of his cavalry, at full trot,
and, leading them in squadrons through the intervals and round the flanks
of the royal infantry, formed them in line on the moor, and led them to
the charge, advancing in front with one large body, while other two
divisions threatened the flanks of the Covenanters.Their devoted army
was now in that situation when the slightest demonstration towards an
attack was certain to inspire panic.Their broken spirits and
disheartened courage were unable to endure the charge of the cavalry,
attended with all its terrible accompaniments of sight and sound;--the
rush of the horses at full speed, the shaking of the earth under their
feet, the glancing of the swords, the waving of the plumes, and the
fierce shouts of the cavaliers.The front ranks hardly attempted one
ill-directed and disorderly fire, and their rear were broken and flying
in confusion ere the charge had been completed; and in less than five
minutes the horsemen were mixed with them, cutting and hewing without
mercy.The voice of Claverhouse was heard, even above the din of
conflict, exclaiming to his soldiers--"Kill, kill--no quarter--think on
Richard Grahame!"The dragoons, many of whom had shared the disgrace of
Loudon-hill, required no exhortations to vengeance as easy as it was
complete.Their swords drank deep of slaughter among the unresisting
fugitives.Screams for quarter were only answered by the shouts with
which the pursuers accompanied their blows, and the whole field presented
one general scene of confused slaughter, flight, and pursuit.About twelve hundred of the insurgents who remained in a body a little
apart from the rest, and out of the line of the charge of cavalry, threw
down their arms and surrendered at discretion, upon the approach of the
Duke of Monmouth at the head of the infantry.That mild-tempered nobleman
instantly allowed them the quarter which they prayed for; and, galloping
about through the field, exerted himself as much to stop the slaughter as
he had done to obtain the victory.While busied in this humane task he
met with General Dalzell, who was encouraging the fierce Highlanders and
royal volunteers to show their zeal for King and country, by quenching
the flame of the rebellion with the blood of the rebels."Sheathe your sword, I command you, General!"exclaimed the Duke, "and
sound the retreat.Enough of blood has been shed; give quarter to the
King's misguided subjects.""I obey your Grace," said the old man, wiping his bloody sword and
returning it to the scabbard; "but I warn you, at the same time, that
enough has not been done to intimidate these desperate rebels.Has not
your Grace heard that Basil Olifant has collected several gentlemen and
men of substance in the west, and is in the act of marching to join
them?"said the Duke; "who, or what is he?""The next male heir to the last Earl of Torwood.He is disaffected to
government from his claim to the estate being set aside in favour of Lady
Margaret Bellenden; and I suppose the hope of getting the inheritance has
set him in motion.""Be his motives what they will," replied Monmouth, "he must soon disperse
his followers, for this army is too much broken to rally again.Therefore, once more, I command that the pursuit be stopped.""It is your Grace's province to command, and to be responsible for your
commands," answered Dalzell, as he gave reluctant orders for checking the
pursuit.But the fiery and vindictive Grahame was already far out of hearing of
the signal of retreat, and continued with his cavalry an unwearied and
bloody pursuit, breaking, dispersing, and cutting to pieces all the
insurgents whom they could come up with.Burley and Morton were both hurried off the field by the confused tide of
fugitives.They made some attempt to defend the streets of the town of
Hamilton; but, while labouring to induce the fliers to face about and
stand to their weapons.Burley received a bullet which broke his
sword-arm."May the hand be withered that shot the shot!"he exclaimed, as the sword
which he was waving over his head fell powerless to his side.[Note: This incident, and Burley's exclamation, are
taken from the records.]Then turning his horse's head, he retreated out of the confusion.Morton
also now saw that the continuing his unavailing efforts to rally the
fliers could only end in his own death or captivity, and, followed by the
faithful Cuddie, he extricated himself from the press, and, being well
mounted, leaped his horse over one or two enclosures, and got into the
open country.From the first hill which they gained in their flight, they looked back,
and beheld the whole country covered with their fugitive companions, and
with the pursuing dragoons, whose wild shouts and halloo, as they did
execution on the groups whom they overtook, mingled with the groans and
screams of their victims, rose shrilly up the hill."It is impossible they can ever make head again," said Morton."The head's taen aff them, as clean as I wad bite it aff a sybo!"They'll be cunning that catches me at this wark
again.--But, for God's sake, sir, let us mak for some strength!"Morton saw the necessity of following the advice of his trusty squire.They resumed a rapid pace, and continued it without intermission,
directing their course towards the wild and mountainous country, where
they thought it likely some part of the fugitives might draw together,
for the sake either of making defence, or of obtaining terms.They require
               Of Heaven the hearts of lions, breath of tigers,
               Yea and the fierceness too.Evening had fallen; and, for the last two hours, they had seen none of
their ill-fated companions, when Morton and his faithful attendant gained
the moorland, and approached a large and solitary farmhouse, situated in
the entrance of a wild glen, far remote from any other habitation."Our horses," said Morton, "will carry us no farther without rest or
food, and we must try to obtain them here, if possible."So speaking, he led the way to the house.The place had every appearance
of being inhabited.There was smoke issuing from the chimney in a
considerable volume, and the marks of recent hoofs were visible around
the door.They could even hear the murmuring of human voices within the
house.But all the lower windows were closely secured; and when they
knocked at the door, no answer was returned.After vainly calling and
entreating admittance, they withdrew to the stable, or shed, in order to
accommodate their horses, ere they used farther means of gaining
admission.In this place they found ten or twelve horses, whose state of
fatigue, as well as the military yet disordered appearance of their
saddles and accoutrements, plainly indicated that their owners were
fugitive insurgents in their own circumstances."This meeting bodes luck," said Cuddie; "and they hae walth o' beef,
that's ae thing certain, for here's a raw hide that has been about the
hurdies o' a stot not half an hour syne--it's warm yet."Encouraged by these appearances, they returned again to the house, and,
announcing themselves as men in the same predicament with the inmates,
clamoured loudly for admittance."Whoever ye be," answered a stern voice from the window, after a long and
obdurate silence, "disturb not those who mourn for the desolation and
captivity of the land, and search out the causes of wrath and of
defection, that the stumbling-blocks may be removed over which we have
stumbled.""They are wild western whigs," said Cuddie, in a whisper to his master,
"I ken by their language.Fiend hae me, if I like to venture on them!"Morton, however, again called to the party within, and insisted on
admittance; but, finding his entreaties still disregarded, he opened one
of the lower windows, and pushing asunder the shutters, which were but
slightly secured, stepped into the large kitchen from which the voice had
issued.Cuddie followed him, muttering betwixt his teeth, as he put his
head within the window, "That he hoped there was nae scalding brose on
the fire;" and master and servant both found themselves in the company of
ten or twelve armed men, seated around the fire, on which refreshments
were preparing, and busied apparently in their devotions.In the gloomy countenances, illuminated by the fire-light, Morton had no
difficulty in recognising several of those zealots who had most
distinguished themselves by their intemperate opposition to all moderate
measures, together with their noted pastor, the fanatical Ephraim
Macbriar, and the maniac, Habakkuk Mucklewrath.The Cameronians neither
stirred tongue nor hand to welcome their brethren in misfortune, but
continued to listen to the low murmured exercise of Macbriar, as he
prayed that the Almighty would lift up his hand from his people, and not
make an end in the day of his anger.That they were conscious of the
presence of the intruders only appeared from the sullen and indignant
glances which they shot at them, from time to time, as their eyes
encountered.Morton, finding into what unfriendly society he had unwittingly intruded,
began to think of retreating; but, on turning his head, observed with
some alarm, that two strong men had silently placed themselves beside the
window, through which they had entered.One of these ominous sentinels
whispered to Cuddie, "Son of that precious woman, Mause Headrigg, do not
cast thy lot farther with this child of treachery and perdition--Pass on
thy way, and tarry not, for the avenger of blood is behind thee."With this he pointed to the window, out of which Cuddie jumped without
hesitation; for the intimation he had received plainly implied the
personal danger he would otherwise incur."Winnocks are no lucky wi' me," was his first reflection when he was in
the open air; his next was upon the probable fate of his master."They'll
kill him, the murdering loons, and think they're doing a gude turn!but
I'se tak the back road for Hamilton, and see if I canna get some o' our
ain folk to bring help in time of needcessity."So saying, Cuddie hastened to the stable, and taking the best horse he
could find instead of his own tired animal, he galloped off in the
direction he proposed.The noise of his horse's tread alarmed for an instant the devotion of the
fanatics.As it died in the distance, Macbriar brought his exercise to a
conclusion, and his audience raised themselves from the stooping posture,
and louring downward look, with which they had listened to it, and all
fixed their eyes sternly on Henry Morton."You bend strange countenances on me, gentlemen," said he, addressing
them."I am totally ignorant in what manner I can have deserved them."exclaimed Mucklewrath, starting up: "the
word that thou hast spurned shall become a rock to crush and to bruise
thee; the spear which thou wouldst have broken shall pierce thy side; we
have prayed, and wrestled, and petitioned for an offering to atone the
sins of the congregation, and lo!the very head of the offence is
delivered into our hand.He hath burst in like a thief through the
window; he is a ram caught in the thicket, whose blood shall be a
drink-offering to redeem vengeance from the church, and the place shall
from henceforth be called Jehovah-Jireh, for the sacrifice is provided.Up then, and bind the victim with cords to the horns of the altar!"There was a movement among the party; and deeply did Morton regret at
that moment the incautious haste with which he had ventured into their
company.He was armed only with his sword, for he had left his pistols at
the bow of his saddle; and, as the whigs were all provided with
fire-arms, there was little or no chance of escaping from them by
resistance.The interposition, however, of Macbriar protected him for the
moment."Tarry yet a while, brethren--let us not use the sword rashly, lest the
load of innocent blood lie heavy on us.--Come," he said, addressing
himself to Morton, "we will reckon with thee ere we avenge the cause thou
hast betrayed.--Hast thou not," he continued, "made thy face as hard as
flint against the truth in all the assemblies of the host?""He has--he has," murmured the deep voices of the assistants."He hath ever urged peace with the malignants," said one."And pleaded for the dark and dismal guilt of the Indulgence," said
another."And would have surrendered the host into the hands of Monmouth," echoed
a third; "and was the first to desert the honest and manly Burley, while
he yet resisted at the pass.I saw him on the moor, with his horse bloody
with spurring, long ere the firing had ceased at the bridge.""Gentlemen," said Morton, "if you mean to bear me down by clamour, and
take my life without hearing me, it is perhaps a thing in your power; but
you will sin before God and man by the commission of such a murder.""I say, hear the youth," said Macbriar; "for Heaven knows our bowels have
yearned for him, that he might be brought to see the truth, and exert his
gifts in its defence.But he is blinded by his carnal knowledge, and has
spurned the light when it blazed before him."Silence being obtained, Morton proceeded to assert the good faith which
he had displayed in the treaty with Monmouth, and the active part he had
borne in the subsequent action."I may not, gentlemen," he said, "be fully able to go the lengths you
desire, in assigning to those of my own religion the means of tyrannizing
over others; but none shall go farther in asserting our own lawful
freedom.And I must needs aver, that had others been of my mind in
counsel, or disposed to stand by my side in battle, we should this
evening, instead of being a defeated and discordant remnant, have
sheathed our weapons in an useful and honourable peace, or brandished
them triumphantly after a decisive victory.""He hath spoken the word," said one of the assembly--"he hath avowed his
carnal self-seeking and Erastianism; let him die the death!""Peace yet again," said Macbriar, "for I will try him further.--Was it
not by thy means that the malignant Evandale twice escaped from death and
captivity?Was it not through thee that Miles Bellenden and his garrison
of cut-throats were saved from the edge of the sword?""I am proud to say, that you have spoken the truth in both instances,"
replied Morton.you see," said Macbriar, "again hath his mouth spoken it.--And didst
thou not do this for the sake of a Midianitish woman, one of the spawn of
prelacy, a toy with which the arch-enemy's trap is baited?Didst thou not
do all this for the sake of Edith Bellenden?""You are incapable," answered Morton, boldly, "of appreciating my
feelings towards that young lady; but all that I have done I would have
done had she never existed.""Thou art a hardy rebel to the truth," said another dark-brow'd man; "and
didst thou not so act, that, by conveying away the aged woman, Margaret
Bellenden, and her grand-daughter, thou mightest thwart the wise and
godly project of John Balfour of Burley for bringing forth to battle
Basil Olifant, who had agreed to take the field if he were insured
possession of these women's worldly endowments?""I never heard of such a scheme," said Morton, "and therefore I could not
thwart it.--But does your religion permit you to take such uncreditable
and immoral modes of recruiting?""Peace," said Macbriar, somewhat disconcerted; "it is not for thee to
instruct tender professors, or to construe Covenant obligations.For the
rest, you have acknowledged enough of sin and sorrowful defection, to
draw down defeat on a host, were it as numerous as the sands on the
sea-shore.And it is our judgment, that we are not free to let you pass
from us safe and in life, since Providence hath given you into our hands
at the moment that we prayed with godly Joshua, saying, 'What shall we
say when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies?'--Then camest
thou, delivered to us as it were by lot, that thou mightest sustain the
punishment of one that hath wrought folly in Israel.This is the Sabbath, and our hand shall not be on thee to spill
thy blood upon this day; but, when the twelfth hour shall strike, it is a
token that thy time on earth hath run!Wherefore improve thy span, for it
flitteth fast away.--Seize on the prisoner, brethren, and take his
weapon."The command was so unexpectedly given, and so suddenly executed by those
of the party who had gradually closed behind and around Morton, that he
was overpowered, disarmed, and a horse-girth passed round his arms,
before he could offer any effectual resistance.When this was
accomplished, a dead and stern silence took place.The fanatics ranged
themselves around a large oaken table, placing Morton amongst them bound
and helpless, in such a manner as to be opposite to the clock which was
to strike his knell.Food was placed before them, of which they offered
their intended victim a share; but, it will readily be believed, he had
little appetite.When this was removed, the party resumed their
devotions.Macbriar, whose fierce zeal did not perhaps exclude some
feelings of doubt and compunction, began to expostulate in prayer, as if
to wring from the Deity a signal that the bloody sacrifice they proposed
was an acceptable service.The eyes and ears of his hearers were
anxiously strained, as if to gain some sight or sound which might be
converted or wrested into a type of approbation, and ever and anon dark
looks were turned on the dial-plate of the time-piece, to watch its
progress towards the moment of execution.Morton's eye frequently took the same course, with the sad reflection,
that there appeared no posibility of his life being expanded beyond the
narrow segment which the index had yet to travel on the circle until it
arrived at the fatal hour.Faith in his religion, with a constant
unyielding principle of honour, and the sense of conscious innocence,
enabled him to pass through this dreadful interval with less agitation
than he himself could have expected, had the situation been prophesied to
him.Yet there was a want of that eager and animating sense of right
which supported him in similar circumstances, when in the power of
Claverhouse.Then he was conscious, that, amid the spectators, were many
who were lamenting his condition, and some who applauded his conduct.But
now, among these pale-eyed and ferocious zealots, whose hardened brows
were soon to be bent, not merely with indifference, but with triumph,
upon his execution,--without a friend to speak a kindly word, or give a
look either of sympathy or encouragement,--awaiting till the sword
destined to slay him crept out of the scabbard gradually, and as it were
by strawbreadths, and condemned to drink the bitterness of death drop by
drop,--it is no wonder that his feelings were less composed than they had
been on any former occasion of danger.His destined executioners, as he
gazed around them, seemed to alter their forms and features, like
spectres in a feverish dream; their figures became larger, and their
faces more disturbed; and, as an excited imagination predominated over
the realities which his eyes received, he could have thought himself
surrounded rather by a band of demons than of human beings; the walls
seemed to drop with blood, and the light tick of the clock thrilled on
his ear with such loud, painful distinctness, as if each sound were the
prick of a bodkin inflicted on the naked nerve of the organ.[Illustration: Morton Awaiting Death--frontispiece2]


It was with pain that he felt his mind wavering, while on the brink
between this and the future world.He made a strong effort to compose
himself to devotional exercises, and unequal, during that fearful strife
of nature, to arrange his own thoughts into suitable expressions, he had,
instinctively, recourse to the petition for deliverance and for composure
of spirit which is to be found in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church
of England.Macbriar, whose family were of that persuasion, instantly
recognised the words, which the unfortunate prisoner pronounced half
aloud."There lacked but this," he said, his pale cheek kindling with
resentment, "to root out my carnal reluctance to see his blood spilt.He
is a prelatist, who has sought the camp under the disguise of an
Erastian, and all, and more than all, that has been said of him must
needs be verity.His blood be on his head, the deceiver!--let him go down
to Tophet, with the ill-mumbled mass which he calls a prayer-book, in his
right hand!""As the sun went
back on the dial ten degrees for intimating the recovery of holy
Hezekiah, so shall it now go forward, that the wicked may be taken away
from among the people, and the Covenant established in its purity."He sprang to a chair with an attitude of frenzy, in order to anticipate
the fatal moment by putting the index forward; and several of the party
began to make ready their slaughter-weapons for immediate execution, when
Mucklewrath's hand was arrested by one of his companions.he said--"I hear a distant noise.""It is the rushing of the brook over the pebbles," said one."It is the sough of the wind among the bracken," said another."It is the galloping of horse," said Morton to himself, his sense of
hearing rendered acute by the dreadful situation in which he stood; "God
grant they may come as my deliverers!"The noise approached rapidly, and became more and more distinct."It is horse," cried Macbriar."Look out and descry who they are."cried one who had opened the window, in
obedience to his order.A thick trampling and loud voices were heard immediately round the house.Some rose to resist, and some to escape; the doors and windows were
forced at once, and the red coats of the troopers appeared in the
apartment."Have at the bloody rebels!--Remember Cornet Grahame!"The lights were struck down, but the dubious glare of the fire enabled
them to continue the fray.Several pistol-shots were fired; the whig who
stood next to Morton received a shot as he was rising, stumbled against
the prisoner, whom he bore down with his weight, and lay stretched above
him a dying man.This accident probably saved Morton from the damage he
might otherwise have received in so close a struggle, where fire-arms
were discharged and sword-blows given for upwards of five minutes.exclaimed the well-known voice of Claverhouse;
"look about for him, and dispatch the whig dog who is groaning there."The groans of the wounded man were silenced by
a thrust with a rapier, and Morton, disencumbered of his weight, was
speedily raised and in the arms of the faithful Cuddie, who blubbered for
joy when he found that the blood with which his master was covered had
not flowed from his own veins.A whisper in Morton's ear, while his
trusty follower relieved him from his bonds, explained the secret of the
very timely appearance of the soldiers."I fell into Claverhouse's party when I was seeking for some o' our ain
folk to help ye out o' the hands of the whigs, sae being atween the deil
and the deep sea, I e'en thought it best to bring him on wi' me, for
he'll be wearied wi' felling folk the night, and the morn's a new day,
and Lord Evandale awes ye a day in ha'arst; and Monmouth gies quarter,
the dragoons tell me, for the asking.Sae haud up your heart, an' I'se
warrant we'll do a' weel eneugh yet."The principal incident of the foregoing
     Chapter was suggested by an occurrence of a similar kind, told me by
     a gentleman, now deceased, who held an important situation in the
     Excise, to which he had been raised by active and resolute exertions
     in an inferior department.When employed as a supervisor on the
     coast of Galloway, at a time when the immunities of the Isle of Man
     rendered smuggling almost universal in that district, this gentleman
     had the fortune to offend highly several of the leaders in the
     contraband trade, by his zeal in serving the revenue.This rendered his situation a dangerous one, and, on more than one
     occasion, placed his life in jeopardy.At one time in particular, as
     he was riding after sunset on a summer evening, he came suddenly
     upon a gang of the most desperate smugglers in that part of the
     country.They surrounded him, without violence, but in such a manner
     as to show that it would be resorted to if he offered resistance,
     and gave him to understand he must spend the evening with them,
     since they had met so happily.The officer did not attempt
     opposition, but only asked leave to send a country lad to tell his
     wife and family that he should be detained later than he expected.As he had to charge the boy with this message in the presence of the
     smugglers, he could found no hope of deliverance from it, save what
     might arise from the sharpness of the lad's observation, and the
     natural anxiety and affection of his wife.But if his errand should
     be delivered and received literally, as he was conscious the
     smugglers expected, it was likely that it might, by suspending alarm
     about his absence from home, postpone all search after him till it
     might be useless.Making a merit of necessity, therefore, he
     instructed and dispatched his messenger, and went with the
     contraband traders, with seeming willingness, to one of their
     ordinary haunts.He sat down at table with them, and they began to
     drink and indulge themselves in gross jokes, while, like Mirabel in
     the "Inconstant," their prisoner had the heavy task of receiving
     their insolence as wit, answering their insults with good-humour,
     and withholding from them the opportunity which they sought of
     engaging him in a quarrel, that they might have a pretence for
     misusing him.He succeeded for some time, but soon became satisfied
     it was their purpose to murder him out-right, or else to beat him in
     such a manner as scarce to leave him with life.A regard for the
     sanctity of the Sabbath evening, which still oddly subsisted among
     these ferocious men, amidst their habitual violation of divine and
     social law, prevented their commencing their intended cruelty until
     the Sabbath should be terminated.They were sitting around their
     anxious prisoner, muttering to each other words of terrible import,
     and watching the index of a clock, which was shortly to strike the
     hour at which, in their apprehension, murder would become lawful,
     when their intended victim heard a distant rustling like the wind
     among withered leaves.It came nearer, and resembled the sound of a
     brook in flood chafing within its banks; it came nearer yet, and was
     plainly distinguished as the galloping of a party of horse.The
     absence of her husband, and the account given by the boy of the
     suspicious appearance of those with whom he had remained, had
     induced Mrs--to apply to the neighbouring town for a party of
     dragoons, who thus providentially arrived in time to save him from
     extreme violence, if not from actual destruction.]Sound, sound the clarion, fill the fife!To all the sensual world proclaim,
               One crowded hour of glorious life
               Is worth an age without a name.When the desperate affray had ceased, Claverhouse commanded his soldiers
to remove the dead bodies, to refresh themselves and their horses, and
prepare for passing the night at the farm-house, and for marching early
in the ensuing morning.He then turned his attention to Morton, and there
was politeness, and even kindness, in the manner in which he addressed
him."You would have saved yourself risk from both sides, Mr Morton, if you
had honoured my counsel yesterday morning with some attention; but I
respect your motives.You are a prisoner-of-war at the disposal of the
king and council, but you shall be treated with no incivility; and I will
be satisfied with your parole that you will not attempt an escape."When Morton had passed his word to that effect, Claverhouse bowed
civilly, and, turning away from him, called for his sergeant-major."How many prisoners, Halliday, and how many killed?""Three killed in the house, sir, two cut down in the court, and one in
the garden--six in all; four prisoners.""Three of them armed to the teeth," answered Halliday; "one without
arms--he seems to be a preacher.""Ay--the trumpeter to the long-ear'd rout, I suppose," replied
Claverhouse, glancing slightly round upon his victims, "I will talk with
him tomorrow.Take the other three down to the yard, draw out two files,
and fire upon them; and, d'ye hear, make a memorandum in the orderly book
of three rebels taken in arms and shot, with the date and name of the
place--Drumshinnel, I think, they call it.--Look after the preacher till
to-morrow; as he was not armed, he must undergo a short examination.Or
better, perhaps, take him before the Privy Council; I think they should
relieve me of a share of this disgusting drudgery.--Let Mr Morton be
civilly used, and see that the men look well after their horses; and let
my groom wash Wild-blood's shoulder with some vinegar, the saddle has
touched him a little."All these various orders,--for life and death, the securing of his
prisoners, and the washing his charger's shoulder,--were given in the
same unmoved and equable voice, of which no accent or tone intimated that
the speaker considered one direction as of more importance than another.The Cameronians, so lately about to be the willing agents of a bloody
execution, were now themselves to undergo it.They seemed prepared alike
for either extremity, nor did any of them show the least sign of fear,
when ordered to leave the room for the purpose of meeting instant death.Their severe enthusiasm sustained them in that dreadful moment, and they
departed with a firm look and in silence, excepting that one of them, as
he left the apartment, looked Claverhouse full in the face, and
pronounced, with a stern and steady voice,--"Mischief shall haunt the
violent man!"to which Grahame only answered by a smile of contempt.They had no sooner left the room than Claverhouse applied himself to some
food, which one or two of his party had hastily provided, and invited
Morton to follow his example, observing, it had been a busy day for them
both.Morton declined eating; for the sudden change of circumstances--the
transition from the verge of the grave to a prospect of life, had
occasioned a dizzy revulsion in his whole system.But the same confused
sensation was accompanied by a burning thirst, and he expressed his wish
to drink."I will pledge you, with all my heart," said Claverhouse; "for here is a
black jack full of ale, and good it must be, if there be good in the
country, for the whigs never miss to find it out.--My service to you, Mr
Morton," he said, filling one horn of ale for himself, and handing
another to his prisoner.Morton raised it to his head, and was just about to drink, when the
discharge of carabines beneath the window, followed by a deep and hollow
groan, repeated twice or thrice, and more faint at each interval,
announced the fate of the three men who had just left them.Morton
shuddered, and set down the untasted cup."You are but young in these matters, Mr Morton," said Claverhouse, after
he had very composedly finished his draught; "and I do not think the
worse of you as a young soldier for appearing to feel them acutely.But
habit, duty, and necessity, reconcile men to every thing.""I trust," said Morton, "they will never reconcile me to such scenes as
these.""You would hardly believe," said Claverhouse in reply, "that, in the
beginning of my military career, I had as much aversion to seeing blood
spilt as ever man felt; it seemed to me to be wrung from my own heart;
and yet, if you trust one of those whig fellows, he will tell you I drink
a warm cup of it every morning before I breakfast.[Note: The author is
uncertain whether this was ever said of Claverhouse.But it was currently
reported of Sir Robert Grierson of Lagg, another of the persecutors, that
a cup of wine placed in his hand turned to clotted blood.]But in truth,
Mr Morton, why should we care so much for death, light upon us or around
us whenever it may?Men die daily--not a bell tolls the hour but it is
the death-note of some one or other; and why hesitate to shorten the span
of others, or take over-anxious care to prolong our own?It is all a
lottery--when the hour of midnight came, you were to die--it has struck,
you are alive and safe, and the lot has fallen on those fellows who were
to murder you.It is not the expiring pang that is worth thinking of in
an event that must happen one day, and may befall us on any given
moment--it is the memory which the soldier leaves behind him, like the
long train of light that follows the sunken sun--that is all which is
worth caring for, which distinguishes the death of the brave or the
ignoble.When I think of death, Mr Morton, as a thing worth thinking of,
it is in the hope of pressing one day some well-fought and hard-won
field of battle, and dying with the shout of victory in my ear--that
would be worth dying for, and more, it would be worth having lived for!"At the moment when Grahame delivered these sentiments, his eye glancing
with the martial enthusiasm which formed such a prominent feature in his
character, a gory figure, which seemed to rise out of the floor of the
apartment, stood upright before him, and presented the wild person and
hideous features of the maniac so often mentioned.His face, where it was
not covered with blood-streaks, was ghastly pale, for the hand of death
was on him.He bent upon Claverhouse eyes, in which the grey light of
insanity still twinkled, though just about to flit for ever, and
exclaimed, with his usual wildness of ejaculation, "Wilt thou trust in
thy bow and in thy spear, in thy steed and in thy banner?And shall not
God visit thee for innocent blood?--Wilt thou glory in thy wisdom, and in
thy courage, and in thy might?And shall not the Lord judge thee?--Behold
the princes, for whom thou hast sold thy soul to the destroyer, shall be
removed from their place, and banished to other lands, and their names
shall be a desolation, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a curse.And thou, who hast partaken of the wine-cup of fury, and hast been
drunken and mad because thereof, the wish of thy heart shall be granted
to thy loss, and the hope of thine own pride shall destroy thee.I summon
thee, John Grahame, to appear before the tribunal of God, to answer for
this innocent blood, and the seas besides which thou hast shed."He drew his right hand across his bleeding face, and held it up to heaven
as he uttered these words, which he spoke very loud, and then added more
faintly, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge
the blood of thy saints!"As he uttered the last word, he fell backwards without an attempt to save
himself, and was a dead man ere his head touched the floor.Morton was much shocked at this extraordinary scene, and the prophecy of
the dying man, which tallied so strangely with the wish which Claverhouse
had just expressed; and he often thought of it afterwards when that wish
seemed to be accomplished.Two of the dragoons who were in the apartment,
hardened as they were, and accustomed to such scenes, showed great
consternation at the sudden apparition, the event, and the words which
preceded it.At the first instant of
Mucklewrath's appearance, he had put his hand to his pistol, but on
seeing the situation of the wounded wretch, he immediately withdrew it,
and listened with great composure to his dying exclamation.When he dropped, Claverhouse asked, in an unconcerned tone of voice--"How
came the fellow here?--Speak, you staring fool!"he added, addressing the
nearest dragoon, "unless you would have me think you such a poltroon as
to fear a dying man."The dragoon crossed himself, and replied with a faltering voice,--"That
the dead fellow had escaped their notice when they removed the other
bodies, as he chanced to have fallen where a cloak or two had been flung
aside, and covered him.""Take him away now, then, you gaping idiot, and see that he does not bite
you, to put an old proverb to shame.--This is a new incident, Mr.Morton,
that dead men should rise and push us from our stools.I must see that my
blackguards grind their swords sharper; they used not to do their work so
slovenly.--But we have had a busy day; they are tired, and their blades
blunted with their bloody work; and I suppose you, Mr Morton, as well as
I, are well disposed for a few hours' repose."So saying, he yawned, and taking a candle which a soldier had placed
ready, saluted Morton courteously, and walked to the apartment which had
been prepared for him.Morton was also accommodated, for the evening, with a separate room.Being left alone, his first occupation was the returning thanks to Heaven
for redeeming him from danger, even through the instrumentality of those
who seemed his most dangerous enemies; he also prayed sincerely for the
Divine assistance in guiding his course through times which held out so
many dangers and so many errors.And having thus poured out his spirit in
prayer before the Great Being who gave it, he betook himself to the
repose which he so much required.The charge is prepared, the lawyers are met,
               The judges all ranged--a terrible show!So deep was the slumber which succeeded the agitation and embarrassment
of the preceding day, that Morton hardly knew where he was when it was
broken by the tramp of horses, the hoarse voice of men, and the wild
sound of the trumpets blowing the _reveille_.The sergeant-major
immediately afterwards came to summon him, which he did in a very
respectful manner, saying the General (for Claverhouse now held that
rank) hoped for the pleasure of his company upon the road.In some
situations an intimation is a command, and Morton considered that the
present occasion was one of these.He waited upon Claverhouse as speedily
as he could, found his own horse saddled for his use, and Cuddie in
attendance.Both were deprived of their fire-arms, though they seemed,
otherwise, rather to make part of the troop than of the prisoners; and
Morton was permitted to retain his sword, the wearing which was, in those
days, the distinguishing mark of a gentleman.Claverhouse seemed also to
take pleasure in riding beside him, in conversing with him, and in
confounding his ideas when he attempted to appreciate his real character.The gentleness and urbanity of that officer's general manners, the high
and chivalrous sentiments of military devotion which he occasionally
expressed, his deep and accurate insight into the human bosom, demanded
at once the approbation and the wonder of those who conversed with him;
while, on the other hand, his cold indifference to military violence and
cruelty seemed altogether inconsistent with the social, and even
admirable qualities which he displayed.Morton could not help, in his
heart, contrasting him with Balfour of Burley; and so deeply did the idea
impress him, that he dropped a hint of it as they rode together at some
distance from the troop."You are right," said Claverhouse, with a smile; "you are very right--we
are both fanatics; but there is some distinction between the fanaticism
of honour and that of dark and sullen superstition.""Yet you both shed blood without mercy or remorse," said Morton, who
could not suppress his feelings."Surely," said Claverhouse, with the same composure; "but of what
kind?--There is a difference, I trust, between the blood of learned and
reverend prelates and scholars, of gallant soldiers and noble gentlemen,
and the red puddle that stagnates in the veins of psalm-singing
mechanics, crackbrained demagogues, and sullen boors;--some distinction,
in short, between spilling a flask of generous wine, and dashing down a
can full of base muddy ale?""Your distinction is too nice for my comprehension," replied Morton."God
gives every spark of life--that of the peasant as well as of the prince;
and those who destroy his work recklessly or causelessly, must answer in
either case.What right, for example, have I to General Grahame's
protection now, more than when I first met him?""And narrowly escaped the consequences, you would say?"answered
Claverhouse--"why, I will answer you frankly.Then I thought I had to do
with the son of an old roundheaded rebel, and the nephew of a sordid
presbyterian laird; now I know your points better, and there is that
about you which I respect in an enemy as much as I like in a friend.I
have learned a good deal concerning you since our first meeting, and I
trust that you have found that my construction of the information has not
been unfavourable to you.""But yet," said Morton--

"But yet," interrupted Grahame, taking up the word, "you would say you
were the same when I first met you that you are now?True; but then, how
could I know that?though, by the by, even my reluctance to suspend your
execution may show you how high your abilities stood in my estimation.""Do you expect, General," said Morton, "that I ought to be particularly
grateful for such a mark of your esteem?""I tell you I thought
you a different sort of person."I have half a mind," said Claverhouse, "to contrive you should have six
months' imprisonment in order to procure you that pleasure.His chapters
inspire me with more enthusiasm than even poetry itself.And the noble
canon, with what true chivalrous feeling he confines his beautiful
expressions of sorrow to the death of the gallant and high-bred knight,
of whom it was a pity to see the fall, such was his loyalty to his king,
pure faith to his religion, hardihood towards his enemy, and fidelity to
his lady-love!--Ah, benedicite!how he will mourn over the fall of such a
pearl of knighthood, be it on the side he happens to favour, or on the
other.But, truly, for sweeping from the face of the earth some few
hundreds of villain churls, who are born but to plough it, the high-born
and inquisitive historian has marvellous little sympathy,--as little, or
less, perhaps, than John Grahame of Claverhouse.""There is one ploughman in your possession, General, for whom," said
Morton, "in despite of the contempt in which you hold a profession which
some philosophers have considered as useful as that of a soldier, I would
humbly request your favour.""You mean," said Claverhouse, looking at a memorandum book, "one
Hatherick--Hedderick--or--or--Headrigg.Ay, Cuthbert, or Cuddie
Headrigg--here I have him.O, never fear him, if he will be but
tractable.The ladies of Tillietudlem made interest with me on his
account some time ago.He is to marry their waiting-maid, I think.He
will be allowed to slip off easy, unless his obstinacy spoils his good
fortune.""He has no ambition to be a martyr, I believe," said Morton."'Tis the better for him," said Claverhouse."But, besides, although the
fellow had more to answer for, I should stand his friend, for the sake of
the blundering gallantry which threw him into the midst of our ranks last
night, when seeking assistance for you.I never desert any man who trusts
me with such implicit confidence.But, to deal sincerely with you, he has
been long in our eye.--Here, Halliday; bring me up the black book."The sergeant, having committed to his commander this ominous record of
the disaffected, which was arranged in alphabetical order, Claverhouse,
turning over the leaves as he rode on, began to read names as they
occurred."Gumblegumption, a minister, aged 50, indulged, close, sly, and so
forth--Pooh!pooh!--He--He--I have him here--Heathercat; outlawed--a
preacher--a zealous Cameronian--keeps a conventicle among the Campsie
hills--Tush!--O, here is Headrigg--Cuthbert; his mother a bitter
puritan--himself a simple fellow--like to be forward in action, but of
no genius for plots--more for the hand than the head, and might be drawn
to the right side, but for his attachment to"--(Here Claverhouse looked
at Morton, and then shut the book and changed his tone.)"Faithful and
true are words never thrown away upon me, Mr Morton.You may depend on
the young man's safety.""Does it not revolt a mind like yours," said Morton, "to follow a system
which is to be supported by such minute enquiries after obscure
individuals?""You do not suppose we take the trouble?""The curates, for their own sakes, willingly collect all these materials
for their own regulation in each parish; they know best the black sheep
of the flock."Will you favour me by imparting it?""Willingly," said Claverhouse; "it can signify little, for you cannot
avenge yourself on the curate, as you will probably leave Scotland for
some time."Morton felt an involuntary
shudder at hearing words which implied a banishment from his native land;
but ere he answered, Claverhouse proceeded to read, "Henry Morton, son of
Silas Morton, Colonel of horse for the Scottish Parliament, nephew and
apparent heir of Morton of Milnwood--imperfectly educated, but with
spirit beyond his years--excellent at all exercises--indifferent to forms
of religion, but seems to incline to the presbyterian--has high-flown and
dangerous notions about liberty of thought and speech, and hovers between
a latitudinarian and an enthusiast.Much admired and followed by the
youth of his own age--modest, quiet, and unassuming in manner, but in his
heart peculiarly bold and intractable.He is--Here follow three red
crosses, Mr Morton, which signify triply dangerous.You see how important
a person you are.--But what does this fellow want?"A horseman rode up as he spoke, and gave a letter.Claverhouse glanced it
over, laughed scornfully, bade him tell his master to send his prisoners
to Edinburgh, for there was no answer; and, as the man turned back, said
contemptuously to Morton--"Here is an ally of yours deserted from you, or
rather, I should say, an ally of your good friend Burley--Hear how he
sets forth--'Dear Sir,' (I wonder when we were such intimates,)'may it
please your Excellency to accept my humble congratulations on the
victory'--hum--hum--'blessed his Majesty's army.I pray you to understand
I have my people under arms to take and intercept all fugitives, and have
already several prisoners,' and so forth.Subscribed Basil Olifant--You
know the fellow by name, I suppose?""A relative of Lady Margaret Bellenden," replied Morton, "is he not?""Ay," replied Grahame, "and heir-male of her father's family, though a
distant one, and moreover a suitor to the fair Edith, though discarded as
an unworthy one; but, above all, a devoted admirer of the estate of
Tillietudlem, and all thereunto belonging.""He takes an ill mode of recommending himself," said Morton, suppressing
his feelings, "to the family at Tillietudlem, by corresponding with our
unhappy party.""O, this precious Basil will turn cat in pan with any man!""He was displeased with the government, because they would
not overturn in his favour a settlement of the late Earl of Torwood, by
which his lordship gave his own estate to his own daughter; he was
displeased with Lady Margaret, because she avowed no desire for his
alliance, and with the pretty Edith, because she did not like his tall
ungainly person.So he held a close correspondence with Burley, and
raised his followers with the purpose of helping him, providing always he
needed no help, that is, if you had beat us yesterday.And now the rascal
pretends he was all the while proposing the King's service, and, for
aught I know, the council will receive his pretext for current coin, for
he knows how to make friends among them--and a dozen scores of poor
vagabond fanatics will be shot, or hanged, while this cunning scoundrel
lies hid under the double cloak of loyalty, well-lined with the fox-fur
of hypocrisy."With conversation on this and other matters they beguiled the way,
Claverhouse all the while speaking with great frankness to Morton, and
treating him rather as a friend and companion than as a prisoner; so
that, however uncertain of his fate, the hours he passed in the company
of this remarkable man were so much lightened by the varied play of his
imagination, and the depth of his knowledge of human nature, that since
the period of his becoming a prisoner of war, which relieved him at once
from the cares of his doubtful and dangerous station among the
insurgents, and from the consequences of their suspicious resentment, his
hours flowed on less anxiously than at any time since his having
commenced actor in public life.He was now, with respect to his fortune,
like a rider who has flung his reins on the horse's neck, and, while he
abandoned himself to circumstances, was at least relieved from the task
of attempting to direct them.In this mood he journeyed on, the number of
his companions being continually augmented by detached parties of horse
who came in from every quarter of the country, bringing with them, for
the most part, the unfortunate persons who had fallen into their power."Our council," said Claverhouse, "being resolved, I suppose, to testify
by their present exultation the extent of their former terror, have
decreed a kind of triumphal entry to us victors and our captives; but as
I do not quite approve the taste of it, I am willing to avoid my own part
in the show, and, at the same time, to save you from yours."So saying, he gave up the command of the forces to Allan, (now a
Lieutenant-colonel,) and, turning his horse into a by-lane, rode into the
city privately, accompanied by Morton and two or three servants.When
Claverhouse arrived at the quarters which he usually occupied in the
Canongate, he assigned to his prisoner a small apartment, with an
intimation, that his parole confined him to it for the present.After about a quarter of an hour spent in solitary musing on the strange
vicissitudes of his late life, the attention of Morton was summoned to
the window by a great noise in the street beneath.Trumpets, drums, and
kettle-drums, contended in noise with the shouts of a numerous rabble,
and apprised him that the royal cavalry were passing in the triumphal
attitude which Claverhouse had mentioned.The magistrates of the city,
attended by their guard of halberds, had met the victors with their
welcome at the gate of the city, and now preceded them as a part of the
procession.The next object was two heads borne upon pikes; and before
each bloody head were carried the hands of the dismembered sufferers,
which were, by the brutal mockery of those who bore them, often
approached towards each other as if in the attitude of exhortation or
prayer.These bloody trophies belonged to two preachers who had fallen at
Bothwell Bridge.After them came a cart led by the executioner's
assistant, in which were placed Macbriar, and other two prisoners, who
seemed of the same profession.They were bareheaded, and strongly bound,
yet looked around them with an air rather of triumph than dismay, and
appeared in no respect moved either by the fate of their companions, of
which the bloody evidences were carried before them, or by dread of their
own approaching execution, which these preliminaries so plainly
indicated.Behind these prisoners, thus held up to public infamy and derision, came
a body of horse, brandishing their broadswords, and filling the wide
street with acclamations, which were answered by the tumultuous outcries
and shouts of the rabble, who, in every considerable town, are too happy
in being permitted to huzza for any thing whatever which calls them
together.In the rear of these troopers came the main body of the
prisoners, at the head of whom were some of their leaders, who were
treated with every circumstance of inventive mockery and insult.Several
were placed on horseback with their faces to the animal's tail; others
were chained to long bars of iron, which they were obliged to support in
their hands, like the galleyslaves in Spain when travelling to the port
where they are to be put on shipboard.The heads of others who had fallen
were borne in triumph before the survivors, some on pikes and halberds,
some in sacks, bearing the names of the slaughtered persons labelled on
the outside.Such were the objects who headed the ghastly procession, who
seemed as effectually doomed to death as if they wore the sanbenitos of
the condemned heretics in an auto-da-fe.[Note: David Hackston of
Rathillet, who was wounded and made prisoner in the skirmish of
Air's-Moss, in which the celebrated Cameron fell, was, on entering
Edinburgh, "by order of the Council, received by the Magistrates at the
Watergate, and set on a horse's bare back with his face to the tail, and
the other three laid on a goad of iron, and carried up the street, Mr
Cameron's head being on a halberd before them."]Behind them came on the nameless crowd to the number of several hundreds,
some retaining under their misfortunes a sense of confidence in the cause
for which they suffered captivity, and were about to give a still more
bloody testimony; others seemed pale, dispirited, dejected, questioning
in their own minds their prudence in espousing a cause which Providence
seemed to have disowned, and looking about for some avenue through which
they might escape from the consequences of their rashness.Others there
were who seemed incapable of forming an opinion on the subject, or of
entertaining either hope, confidence, or fear, but who, foaming with
thirst and fatigue, stumbled along like over-driven oxen, lost to every
thing but their present sense of wretchedness, and without having any
distinct idea whether they were led to the shambles or to the pasture.These unfortunate men were guarded on each hand by troopers, and behind
them came the main body of the cavalry, whose military music resounded
back from the high houses on each side of the street, and mingled with
their own songs of jubilee and triumph, and the wild shouts of the
rabble.Morton felt himself heart-sick while he gazed on the dismal spectacle,
and recognised in the bloody heads, and still more miserable and agonized
features of the living sufferers, faces which had been familiar to him
during the brief insurrection.He sunk down in a chair in a bewildered
and stupified state, from which he was awakened by the voice of Cuddie.said the poor fellow, his teeth chattering like a
pair of nut-crackers, his hair erect like boar's bristles, and his face
as pale as that of a corpse--"Lord forgie us, sir!we maun instantly gang
before the Council!--O Lord, what made them send for a puir bodie like
me, sae mony braw lords and gentles!--and there's my mither come on the
lang tramp frae Glasgow to see to gar me testify, as she ca's it, that is
to say, confess and be hanged; but deil tak me if they mak sic a guse o'
Cuddie, if I can do better.But here's Claverhouse himsell--the Lord
preserve and forgie us, I say anes mair!""You must immediately attend the Council Mr Morton," said Claverhouse,
who entered while Cuddie spoke, "and your servant must go with you.You
need be under no apprehension for the consequences to yourself
personally.But I warn you that you will see something that will give you
much pain, and from which I would willingly have saved you, if I had
possessed the power.It will be readily supposed that Morton did not venture to dispute this
invitation, however unpleasant."I must apprise you," said the latter, as he led the way down stairs,
"that you will get off cheap; and so will your servant, provided he can
keep his tongue quiet."Cuddie caught these last words to his exceeding joy."Deil a fear o' me," said he, "an my mither disna pit her finger in the
pie."At that moment his shoulder was seized by old Mause, who had contrived to
thrust herself forward into the lobby of the apartment."O, hinny, hinny!"said she to Cuddie, hanging upon his neck, "glad and
proud, and sorry and humbled am I, a'in ane and the same instant, to see
my bairn ganging to testify for the truth gloriously with his mouth in
council, as he did with his weapon in the field!""Whisht, whisht, mither!""Odd, ye daft wife,
is this a time to speak o' thae things?I tell ye I'll testify naething
either ae gate or another.I hae spoken to Mr Poundtext, and I'll tak the
declaration, or whate'er they ca'it, and we're a' to win free off if we
do that--he's gotten life for himsell and a' his folk, and that's a
minister for my siller; I like nane o' your sermons that end in a psalm
at the Grassmarket."[Note: Then the place of public execution.]"O, Cuddie, man, laith wad I be they suld hurt ye," said old Mause,
divided grievously between the safety of her son's soul and that of his
body; "but mind, my bonny bairn, ye hae battled for the faith, and dinna
let the dread o' losing creature-comforts withdraw ye frae the gude
fight.""Hout tout, mither," replied Cuddie, "I hae fought e'en ower muckle
already, and, to speak plain, I'm wearied o'the trade.I hae swaggered
wi' a' thae arms, and muskets, and pistols, buffcoats, and bandoliers,
lang eneugh, and I like the pleughpaidle a hantle better.I ken naething
suld gar a man fight, (that's to say, when he's no angry,) by and
out-taken the dread o'being hanged or killed if he turns back.""But, my dear Cuddie," continued the persevering Mause, "your bridal
garment--Oh, hinny, dinna sully the marriage garment!""Awa, awa, mither," replied.Cuddie; "dinna ye see the folks waiting for
me?--Never fear me--I ken how to turn this far better than ye do--for
ye're bleezing awa about marriage, and the job is how we are to win by
hanging."So saying, he extricated himself out of his mother's embraces, and
requested the soldiers who took him in charge to conduct him to the place
of examination without delay.He had been already preceded by Claverhouse
and Morton.The Privy Council of Scotland, in whom the practice since the union of
the crowns vested great judicial powers, as well as the general
superintendence of the executive department, was met in the ancient dark
Gothic room, adjoining to the House of Parliament in Edinburgh, when
General Grahame entered and took his place amongst the members at the
council table."You have brought us a leash of game to-day, General," said a nobleman of
high place amongst them."Here is a craven to confess--a cock of the game
to stand at bay--and what shall I call the third, General?""Without further metaphor, I will entreat your Grace to call him a person
in whom I am specially interested," replied Claverhouse.said the nobleman, lolling out a tongue
which was at all times too big for his mouth, and accommodating his
coarse features to a sneer, to which they seemed to be familiar."Yes, please your Grace, a whig; as your Grace was in 1641," replied
Claverhouse, with his usual appearance of imperturbable civility."He has you there, I think, my Lord Duke," said one of the Privy
Councillors."Ay, ay," returned the Duke, laughing, "there's no speaking to him since
Drumclog--but come, bring in the prisoners--and do you, Mr Clerk, read
the record."The clerk read forth a bond, in which General Grahame of Claverhouse and
Lord Evandale entered themselves securities, that Henry Morton, younger
of Milnwood, should go abroad and remain in foreign parts, until his
Majesty's pleasure was further known, in respect of the said Henry
Morton's accession to the late rebellion, and that under penalty of life
and limb to the said Henry Morton, and of ten thousand marks to each of
his securities."Do you accept of the King's mercy upon these terms, Mr Morton?"said the
Duke of Lauderdale, who presided in the Council."I have no other choice, my lord," replied Morton.Morton did so without reply, conscious that, in the circumstances of his
case, it was impossible for him to have escaped more easily.Macbriar,
who was at the same instant brought to the foot of the council-table,
bound upon a chair, for his weakness prevented him from standing, beheld
Morton in the act of what he accounted apostasy."He hath summed his defection by owning the carnal power of the tyrant!"he exclaimed, with a deep groan--"A fallen star!--a fallen star!""Hold your peace, sir," said the Duke, "and keep your ain breath to cool
your ain porridge--ye'll find them scalding hot, I promise you.--Call in
the other fellow, who has some common sense.One sheep will leap the
ditch when another goes first."Cuddie was introduced unbound, but under the guard of two halberdiers,
and placed beside Macbriar at the foot of the table.The poor fellow cast
a piteous look around him, in which were mingled awe for the great men in
whose presence he stood, and compassion for his fellow-sufferers, with no
small fear of the personal consequences which impended over himself.He
made his clownish obeisances with a double portion of reverence, and then
awaited the opening of the awful scene."Were you at the battle of Bothwell Brigg?"was the first question which
was thundered in his ears.Cuddie meditated a denial, but had sense enough, upon reflection, to
discover that the truth would be too strong for him; so he replied, with
true Caledonian indirectness of response, "I'll no say but it may be
possible that I might hae been there.""Answer directly, you knave--yes, or no?--You know you were there.""It's no for me to contradict your Lordship's Grace's honour," said
Cuddie."Once more, sir, were you there?--yes, or no?""Dear stir," again replied Cuddie, "how can ane mind preceesely where
they hae been a' the days o' their life?""Speak out, you scoundrel," said General Dalzell, "or I'll dash your
teeth out with my dudgeonhaft!--Do you think we can stand here all day to
be turning and dodging with you, like greyhounds after a hare?"[Note:
The General is said to have struck one of the captive whigs, when under
examination, with the hilt of his sabre, so that the blood gushed out.The provocation for this unmanly violence was, that the prisoner had
called the fierce veteran "a Muscovy beast, who used to roast men."Dalzell had been long in the Russian service, which in those days was no
school of humanity.]"Aweel, then," said Cuddie, "since naething else will please ye, write
down that I cannot deny but I was there.""Well, sir," said the Duke, "and do you think that the rising upon that
occasion was rebellion or not?""I'm no just free to gie my opinion, stir," said the cautious captive,
"on what might cost my neck; but I doubt it will be very little better.""Just than rebellion, as your honour ca's it," replied Cuddie."Well, sir, that's speaking to the purpose," replied his Grace."And are
you content to accept of the King's pardon for your guilt as a rebel, and
to keep the church, and pray for the King?""Blithely, stir," answered the unscrupulous Cuddie; "and drink his health
into the bargain, when the ale's gude.""Egad," said the Duke, "this is a hearty cock.--What brought you into
such a scrape, mine honest friend?""Just ill example, stir," replied the prisoner, "and a daft auld jaud of
a mither, wi' reverence to your Grace's honour.""Why, God-a-mercy, my friend," replied the Duke, "take care of bad advice
another time; I think you are not likely to commit treason on your own
score.--Make out his free pardon, and bring forward the rogue in the
chair."Macbriar was then moved forward to the post of examination."Were you at the battle of Bothwell Bridge?"was, in like manner,
demanded of him."I was," answered the prisoner, in a bold and resolute tone."I was not--I went in my calling as a preacher of God's word, to
encourage them that drew the sword in His cause.""In other words, to aid and abet the rebels?""Thou hast spoken it," replied the prisoner."Well, then," continued the interrogator, "let us know if you saw John
Balfour of Burley among the party?--I presume you know him?""I bless God that I do know him," replied Macbriar; "he is a zealous and
a sincere Christian.""And when and where did you last see this pious personage?""I am here to answer for myself," said Macbriar, in the same dauntless
manner, "and not to endanger others.""We shall know," said Dalzell, "how to make you find your tongue.""If you can make him fancy himself in a conventicle," answered
Lauderdale, "he will find it without you.--Come, laddie, speak while the
play is good--you're too young to bear the burden will be laid on you
else.""I defy you," retorted Macbriar."This has not been the first of my
imprisonments or of my sufferings; and, young as I may be, I have lived
long enough to know how to die when I am called upon.""Ay, but there are some things which must go before an easy death, if you
continue obstinate," said Lauderdale, and rung a small silver bell which
was placed before him on the table.A dark crimson curtain, which covered a sort of niche, or Gothic recess
in the wall, rose at the signal, and displayed the public executioner, a
tall, grim, and hideous man, having an oaken table before him, on which
lay thumb-screws, and an iron case, called the Scottish boot, used in
those tyrannical days to torture accused persons.Morton, who was
unprepared for this ghastly apparition, started when the curtain arose,
but Macbriar's nerves were more firm.He gazed upon the horrible
apparatus with much composure; and if a touch of nature called the blood
from his cheek for a second, resolution sent it back to his brow with
greater energy.said Lauderdale, in a low, stern voice,
almost sinking into a whisper."He is, I suppose," replied Macbriar, "the infamous executioner of your
bloodthirsty commands upon the persons of God's people.He and you are
equally beneath my regard; and, I bless God, I no more fear what he can
inflict than what you can command.Flesh and blood may shrink under the
sufferings you can doom me to, and poor frail nature may shed tears, or
send forth cries; but I trust my soul is anchored firmly on the rock of
ages.""Do your duty," said the Duke to the executioner.The fellow advanced, and asked, with a harsh and discordant voice, upon
which of the prisoner's limbs he should first employ his engine."Let him choose for himself," said the Duke; "I should like to oblige him
in any thing that is reasonable.""Since you leave it to me," said the prisoner, stretching forth his right
leg, "take the best--I willingly bestow it in the cause for which I
suffer."[Note: This was the reply actually made by James Mitchell when
subjected to the torture of the boot, for an attempt to assassinate
Archbishop Sharpe.]The executioner, with the help of his assistants, enclosed the leg and
knee within the tight iron boot, or case, and then placing a wedge of the
same metal between the knee and the edge of the machine, took a mallet in
his hand, and stood waiting for farther orders.A well-dressed man, by
profession a surgeon, placed himself by the other side of the prisoner's
chair, bared the prisoner's arm, and applied his thumb to the pulse in
order to regulate the torture according to the strength of the patient.When these preparations were made, the President of the Council repeated
with the same stern voice the question, "When and where did you last see
John Balfour of Burley?"The prisoner, instead of replying to him, turned his eyes to heaven as if
imploring Divine strength, and muttered a few words, of which the last
were distinctly audible, "Thou hast said thy people shall be willing in
the day of thy power!"The Duke of Lauderdale glanced his eye around the council as if to
collect their suffrages, and, judging from their mute signs, gave on his
own part a nod to the executioner, whose mallet instantly descended on
the wedge, and, forcing it between the knee and the iron boot, occasioned
the most exquisite pain, as was evident from the flush which instantly
took place on the brow and on the cheeks of the sufferer.The fellow then
again raised his weapon, and stood prepared to give a second blow."Will you yet say," repeated the Duke of Lauderdale, "where and when you
last parted from Balfour of Burley?""You have my answer," said the sufferer resolutely, and the second blow
fell.The third and fourth succeeded; but at the fifth, when a larger
wedge had been introduced, the prisoner set up a scream of agony.Morton, whose blood boiled within him at witnessing such cruelty, could
bear no longer, and, although unarmed and himself in great danger, was
springing forward, when Claverhouse, who observed his emotion, withheld
him by force, laying one hand on his arm and the other on his mouth,
while he whispered, "For God's sake, think where you are!"This movement, fortunately for him, was observed by no other of the
councillors, whose attention was engaged with the dreadful scene before
them."He is gone," said the surgeon--"he has fainted, my Lords, and human
nature can endure no more.""Release him," said the Duke; and added, turning to Dalzell, "He will
make an old proverb good, for he'll scarce ride to-day, though he has had
his boots on."Ay, dispatch his sentence, and have done with him; we have plenty of
drudgery behind."Strong waters and essences were busily employed to recall the senses of
the unfortunate captive; and, when his first faint gasps intimated a
return of sensation, the Duke pronounced sentence of death upon him, as a
traitor taken in the act of open rebellion, and adjudged him to be
carried from the bar to the common place of execution, and there hanged
by the neck; his head and hands to be stricken off after death, and
disposed of according to the pleasure of the Council, [Note: The pleasure
of the Council respecting the relics of their victims was often as savage
as the rest of their conduct.The heads of the preachers were frequently
exposed on pikes between their two hands, the palms displayed as in the
attitude of prayer.When the celebrated Richard Cameron's head was
exposed in this manner, a spectator bore testimony to it as that of one
who lived praying and preaching, and died praying and fighting.]and all
and sundry his movable goods and gear escheat and inbrought to his
Majesty's use."Doomster," he continued, "repeat the sentence to the prisoner."The office of Doomster was in those days, and till a much later period,
held by the executioner in commendam, with his ordinary functions.[Note:
See a note on the subject of this office in the Heart of Mid-Lothian.]The duty consisted in reciting to the unhappy criminal the sentence of
the law as pronounced by the judge, which acquired an additional and
horrid emphasis from the recollection, that the hateful personage by whom
it was uttered was to be the agent of the cruelties he denounced.Macbriar had scarce understood the purport of the words as first
pronounced by the Lord President of the Council; but he was sufficiently
recovered to listen and to reply to the sentence when uttered by the
harsh and odious voice of the ruffian who was to execute it, and at the
last awful words, "And this I pronounce for doom," he answered boldly--
"My Lords, I thank you for the only favour I looked for, or would accept
at your hands, namely, that you have sent the crushed and maimed carcass,
which has this day sustained your cruelty, to this hasty end.It were
indeed little to me whether I perish on the gallows or in the
prison-house; but if death, following close on what I have this day
suffered, had found me in my cell of darkness and bondage, many might
have lost the sight how a Christian man can suffer in the good cause.For
the rest, I forgive you, my Lords, for what you have appointed and I have
sustained--And why should I not?--Ye send me to a happy exchange--to the
company of angels and the spirits of the just, for that of frail dust
and ashes--Ye send me from darkness into day--from mortality to
immortality--and, in a word, from earth to heaven!--If the thanks,
therefore, and pardon of a dying man can do you good, take them at my
hand, and may your last moments be as happy as mine!"As he spoke thus, with a countenance radiant with joy and triumph, he was
withdrawn by those who had brought him into the apartment, and executed
within half an hour, dying with the same enthusiastic firmness which his
whole life had evinced.The Council broke up, and Morton found himself again in the carriage with
General Grahame."Marvellous firmness and gallantry!"said Morton, as he reflected upon
Macbriar's conduct; "what a pity it is that with such self-devotion and
heroism should have been mingled the fiercer features of his sect!""You mean," said Claverhouse, "his resolution to condemn you to death?--
To that he would have reconciled himself by a single text; for example,
'And Phinehas arose and executed judgment,' or something to the same
purpose.--But wot ye where you are now bound, Mr Morton?""We are on the road to Leith, I observe," answered Morton."Can I not be
permitted to see my friends ere I leave my native land?""Your uncle," replied Grahame, "has been spoken to, and declines visiting
you.The good gentleman is terrified, and not without some reason, that
the crime of your treason may extend itself over his lands and
tenements--he sends you, however, his blessing, and a small sum of money.Major Bellenden is at
Tillietudlem putting matters in order.The scoundrels have made great
havoc there with Lady Margaret's muniments of antiquity, and have
desecrated and destroyed what the good lady called the Throne of his most
Sacred Majesty.Is there any one else whom you would wish to see?"Morton sighed deeply as he answered, "No--it would avail nothing.--But my
preparations,--small as they are, some must be necessary.""They are all ready for you," said the General."Lord Evandale has
anticipated all you wish.Here is a packet from him with letters of
recommendation for the court of the Stadtholder Prince of Orange, to
which I have added one or two.I made my first campaigns under him, and
first saw fire at the battle of Seneff.Claverhouse
greatly distinguished himself in this action, and was made Captain.]There are also bills of exchange for your immediate wants, and more will
be sent when you require it."Morton heard all this and received the parcel with an astounded and
confused look, so sudden was the execution of the sentence of banishment."He shall be taken care of, and replaced, if it be practicable, in the
service of Lady Margaret Bellenden; I think he will hardly neglect the
parade of the feudal retainers, or go a-whigging a second time.--But here
we are upon the quay, and the boat waits you."A boat waited for Captain Morton, with
the trunks and baggage belonging to his rank.Claverhouse shook him by
the hand, and wished him good fortune, and a happy return to Scotland in
quieter times."I shall never forget," he said, "the gallantry of your behaviour to my
friend Evandale, in circumstances when many men would have sought to rid
him out of their way."As Morton descended the pier
to get into the boat, a hand placed in his a letter folded up in very
small space.The person who gave it seemed much muffled
up; he pressed his finger upon his lip, and then disappeared among the
crowd.The incident awakened Morton's curiosity; and when he found
himself on board of a vessel bound for Rotterdam, and saw all his
companions of the voyage busy making their own arrangements, he took an
opportunity to open the billet thus mysteriously thrust upon him.It ran
thus:--"Thy courage on the fatal day when Israel fled before his
enemies, hath, in some measure, atoned for thy unhappy owning of the
Erastian interest.These are not days for Ephraim to strive with Israel.--I know thy heart is with the daughter of the stranger.But turn from
that folly; for in exile, and in flight, and even in death itself, shall
my hand be heavy against that bloody and malignant house, and Providence
hath given me the means of meting unto them with their own measure of
ruin and confiscation.The resistance of their stronghold was the main
cause of our being scattered at Bothwell Bridge, and I have bound it upon
my soul to visit it upon them.Wherefore, think of her no more, but join
with our brethren in banishment, whose hearts are still towards this
miserable land to save and to relieve her.There is an honest remnant in
Holland whose eyes are looking out for deliverance.Join thyself unto
them like the true son of the stout and worthy Silas Morton, and thou
wilt have good acceptance among them for his sake and for thine own
working.Shouldst thou be found worthy again to labour in the vineyard,
thou wilt at all times hear of my in-comings and out-goings, by enquiring
after Quintin Mackell of Irongray, at the house of that singular
Christian woman, Bessie Maclure, near to the place called the Howff,
where Niel Blane entertaineth guests.So much from him who hopes to hear
again from thee in brotherhood, resisting unto blood, and striving
against sin.Keep thy sword
girded, and thy lamp burning, as one that wakes in the night; for He who
shall judge the Mount of Esau, and shall make false professors as straw,
and malignants as stubble, will come in the fourth watch with garments
dyed in blood, and the house of Jacob shall be for spoil, and the house
of Joseph for fire.I am he that hath written it, whose hand hath been on
the mighty in the waste field."This extraordinary letter was subscribed J. B. of B.; but the signature
of these initials was not necessary for pointing out to Morton that it
could come from no other than Burley.It gave him new occasion to admire
the indomitable spirit of this man, who, with art equal to his courage
and obstinacy, was even now endeavouring to re-establish the web of
conspiracy which had been so lately torn to pieces.But he felt no sort
of desire, in the present moment, to sustain a correspondence which must
be perilous, or to renew an association, which, in so many ways, had been
nearly fatal to him.The threats which Burley held out against the family
of Bellenden, he considered as a mere expression of his spleen on account
of their defence of Tillietudlem; and nothing seemed less likely than
that, at the very moment of their party being victorious, their fugitive
and distressed adversary could exercise the least influence over their
fortunes.Morton, however, hesitated for an instant, whether he should not send
the Major or Lord Evandale intimation of Burley's threats.Upon
consideration, he thought he could not do so without betraying his
confidential correspondence; for to warn them of his menaces would have
served little purpose, unless he had given them a clew to prevent them,
by apprehending his person; while, by doing so, he deemed he should
commit an ungenerous breach of trust to remedy an evil which seemed
almost imaginary.Upon mature consideration, therefore, he tore the
letter, having first made a memorandum of the name and place where the
writer was to be heard of, and threw the fragments into the sea.While Morton was thus employed the vessel was unmoored, and the white
sails swelled out before a favourable north-west wind.The ship leaned
her side to the gale, and went roaring through the waves, leaving a long
and rippling furrow to track her course.The city and port from which he
had sailed became undistinguishable in the distance; the hills by which
they were surrounded melted finally into the blue sky, and Morton was
separated for several years from the land of his nativity.It is fortunate for tale-tellers that they are not tied down like
theatrical writers to the unities of time and place, but may conduct
their personages to Athens and Thebes at their pleasure, and bring them
back at their convenience.Time, to use Rosalind's simile, has hitherto
paced with the hero of our tale; for betwixt Morton's first appearance as
a competitor for the popinjay and his final departure for Holland hardly
two months elapsed.Years, however, glided away ere we find it possible
to resume the thread of our narrative, and Time must be held to have
galloped over the interval.Craving, therefore, the privilege of my cast,
I entreat the reader's attention to the continuation of the narrative, as
it starts from a new era, being the year immediately subsequent to the
British Revolution.Scotland had just begun to repose from the convulsion occasioned by a
change of dynasty, and, through the prudent tolerance of King William,
had narrowly escaped the horrors of a protracted civil war.Agriculture
began to revive, and men, whose minds had been disturbed by the violent
political concussions, and the general change of government in Church and
State, had begun to recover their ordinary temper, and to give the usual
attention to their own private affairs, in lieu of discussing those of
the public.The Highlanders alone resisted the newly established order of
things, and were in arms in a considerable body under the Viscount of
Dundee, whom our readers have hitherto known by the name of Grahame of
Claverhouse.But the usual state of the Highlands was so unruly that
their being more or less disturbed was not supposed greatly to affect the
general tranquillity of the country, so long as their disorders were
confined within their own frontiers.In the Lowlands, the Jacobites, now
the undermost party, had ceased to expect any immediate advantage by open
resistance, and were, in their turn, driven to hold private meetings, and
form associations for mutual defence, which the government termed
treason, while they cried out persecution.The triumphant Whigs, while they re-established Presbytery as the
national religion, and assigned to the General Assemblies of the Kirk
their natural influence, were very far from going the lengths which the
Cameronians and more extravagant portion of the nonconformists under
Charles and James loudly demanded.They would listen to no proposal for
re-establishing the Solemn League and Covenant; and those who had
expected to find in King William a zealous Covenanted Monarch, were
grievously disappointed when he intimated, with the phlegm peculiar to
his country, his intention to tolerate all forms of religion which were
consistent with the safety of the State.The principles of indulgence
thus espoused and gloried in by the Government gave great offence to the
more violent party, who condemned them as diametrically contrary to
Scripture,--for which narrow-spirited doctrine they cited various texts,
all, as it may well be supposed, detached from their context, and most of
them derived from the charges given to the Jews in the Old Testament
dispensation to extirpate idolaters out of the Promised Land.They also
murmured highly against the influence assumed by secular persons in
exercising the rights of patronage, which they termed a rape upon the
chastity of the Church.They censured and condemned as Erastian many of
the measures by which Government after the Revolution showed an
inclination to interfere with the management of the Church, and they
positively refused to take the oath of allegiance to King William and
Queen Mary until they should, on their part, have sworn to the Solemn
League--and Covenant, the Magna Charta, as they termed it, of the
Presbyterian Church.This party, therefore, remained grumbling and dissatisfied, and made
repeated declarations against defections and causes of wrath, which, had
they been prosecuted as in the two former reigns, would have led to the
same consequence of open rebellion.But as the murmurers were allowed to
hold their meetings uninterrupted, and to testify as much as they pleased
against Socinianism, Erastianism, and all the compliances and defections
of the time, their zeal, unfanned by persecution, died gradually away,
their numbers became diminished, and they sunk into the scattered remnant
of serious, scrupulous, and harmless enthusiasts, of whom Old Mortality,
whose legends have afforded the groundwork of my tale, may be taken as no
bad representative.But in the years which immediately succeeded the
Revolution, the Cameronians continued a sect strong in numbers and
vehement in their political opinions, whom Government wished to
discourage, while they prudently temporised with them.These men formed
one violent party in the State; and the Episcopalian and Jacobite
interest, notwithstanding their ancient and national animosity, yet
repeatedly endeavoured to intrigue among them, and avail themselves of
their discontents, to obtain their assistance in recalling the Stewart
family.The Revolutionary Government in the mean while, was supported by
the great bulk of the Lowland interest, who were chiefly disposed to a
moderate Presbytery, and formed in a great measure the party who in the
former oppressive reigns were stigmatized by the Cameronians for having
exercised that form of worship under the declaration of Indulgence issued
by Charles II.Such was the state of parties in Scotland immediately
subsequent to the Revolution.It was on a delightful summer evening that a stranger, well mounted, and
having the appearance of a military man of rank, rode down a winding
descent which terminated in view of the romantic ruins of Bothwell Castle
and the river Clyde, which winds so beautifully between rocks and woods
to sweep around the towers formerly built by Aymer de Valence.Bothwell
Bridge was at a little distance, and also in sight.The opposite field,
once the scene of slaughter and conflict, now lay as placid and quiet as
the surface of a summer lake.The trees and bushes, which grew around in
romantic variety of shade, were hardly seen to stir under the influence
of the evening breeze.The very murmur of the river seemed to soften
itself into unison with the stillness of the scene around.The path through which the traveller descended was occasionally shaded by
detached trees of great size, and elsewhere by the hedges and boughs of
flourishing orchards, now laden with summer fruits.The nearest object of consequence was a farmhouse, or, it might be, the
abode of a small proprietor, situated on the side of a sunny bank which
was covered by apple and pear trees.At the foot of the path which led up
to this modest mansion was a small cottage, pretty much in the situation
of a porter's lodge, though obviously not designed for such a purpose.The hut seemed comfortable, and more neatly arranged than is usual in
Scotland.It had its little garden, where some fruit-trees and bushes
were mingled with kitchen herbs; a cow and six sheep fed in a paddock
hard by; the cock strutted and crowed, and summoned his family around him
before the door; a heap of brushwood and turf, neatly made up, indicated
that the winter fuel was provided; and the thin blue smoke which ascended
from the straw-bound chimney, and winded slowly out from among the green
trees, showed that the evening meal was in the act of being made ready.To complete the little scene of rural peace and comfort, a girl of about
five years old was fetching water in a pitcher from a beautiful fountain
of the purest transparency, which bubbled up at the root of a decayed old
oak-tree about twenty yards from the end of the cottage.The stranger reined up his horse and called to the little nymph, desiring
to know the way to Fairy Knowe.The child set down her water-pitcher,
hardly understanding what was said to her, put her fair flaxen hair apart
on her brows, and opened her round blue eyes with the wondering "What's
your wull?"which is usually a peasant's first answer, if it can be
called one, to all questions whatever."I wish to know the way to Fairy Knowe.""Mammie, mammie," exclaimed the little rustic, running towards the door
of the hut, "come out and speak to the gentleman."Her mother appeared,--a handsome young country-woman, to whose features,
originally sly and espiegle in expression, matrimony had given that
decent matronly air which peculiarly marks the peasant's wife of
Scotland.She had an infant in one arm, and with the other she smoothed
down her apron, to which hung a chubby child of two years old.The elder
girl, whom the traveller had first seen, fell back behind her mother as
soon as she appeared, and kept that station, occasionally peeping out to
look at the stranger.said the woman, with an air of respectful
breeding not quite common in her rank of life, but without anything
resembling forwardness.The stranger looked at her with great earnestness for a moment, and then
replied, "I am seeking a place called Fairy Knowe, and a man called
Cuthbert Headrigg."It's my gudeman, sir," said the young woman, with a smile of welcome."Will you alight, sir, and come into our puir dwelling?--Cuddie,
Cuddie,"--a white-headed rogue of four years appeared at the door of the
hut--"rin awa, my bonny man, and tell your father a gentleman wants him.Or, stay,--Jenny, ye'll hae mair sense: rin ye awa and tell him; he's
down at the Four-acres Park.--Winna ye light down and bide a blink, sir?Or would ye take a mouthfu' o' bread and cheese, or a drink o' ale, till
our gudeman comes.It's gude ale, though I shouldna say sae that brews
it; but ploughmanlads work hard, and maun hae something to keep their
hearts abune by ordinar, sae I aye pit a gude gowpin o' maut to the
browst."As the stranger declined her courteous offers, Cuddie, the reader's old
acquaintance, made his appearance in person.His countenance still
presented the same mixture of apparent dulness with occasional sparkles,
which indicated the craft so often found in the clouted shoe.He looked
on the rider as on one whom he never had before seen, and, like his
daughter and wife, opened the conversation with the regular query,
"What's your wull wi' me, sir?""I have a curiosity to ask some questions about this country," said the
traveller, "and I was directed to you as an intelligent man who can
answer them.""Nae doubt, sir," said Cuddie, after a moment's hesitation."But I would
first like to ken what sort of questions they are.I hae had sae mony
questions speered at me in my day, and in sic queer ways, that if ye kend
a', ye wadna wonder at my jalousing a' thing about them.My mother gar 'd
me learn the Single Carritch, whilk was a great vex; then I behoved to
learn about my godfathers and godmothers to please the auld leddy; and
whiles I jumbled them thegether and pleased nane o' them; and when I cam
to man's yestate, cam another kind o' questioning in fashion that I liked
waur than Effectual Calling; and the 'did promise and vow' of the tape
were yokit to the end o' the tother.Sae ye see, sir, I aye like to hear
questions asked befor I answer them.""You have nothing to apprehend from mine, my good friend; they only
relate to the state of the country."replied Cuddie; "ou, the country's weel eneugh, an it werena
that dour deevil, Claver'se (they ca' him Dundee now), that's stirring
about yet in the Highlands, they say, wi' a' the Donalds and Duncans and
Dugalds, that ever wore bottomless breeks, driving about wi' him, to set
things asteer again, now we hae gotten them a' reasonably weel settled.But Mackay will pit him down, there's little doubt o' that; he'll gie him
his fairing, I'll be caution for it.""What makes you so positive of that, my friend?""I heard it wi' my ain lugs," answered Cuddie, "foretauld to him by a man
that had been three hours stane dead, and came back to this earth again
just to tell him his mind.It was at a place they ca' Drumshinnel.""I can hardly believe you, my friend.""Ye might ask my mither, then, if she were in life," said Cuddie; "it was
her explained it a' to me, for I thought the man had only been wounded.At ony rate, he spake of the casting out of the Stewarts by their very
names, and the vengeance that was brewing for Claver'se and his dragoons.They ca'd the man Habakkuk Mucklewrath; his brain was a wee ajee, but he
was a braw preacher for a' that.""You seem," said the stranger, "to live in a rich and peaceful country.""It's no to compleen o', sir, an we get the crap weel in," quoth Cuddie;
"but if ye had seen the blude rinnin' as fast on the tap o' that brigg
yonder as ever the water ran below it, ye wadna hae thought it sae bonnie
a spectacle."I was waiting upon Monmouth that
morning, my good friend, and did see some part of the action," said the
stranger."Then ye saw a bonny stour," said Cuddie, "that sail serve me for
fighting a' the days o' my life.I judged ye wad be a trooper, by your
red scarlet lace-coat and your looped hat.""And which side were you upon, my friend?"continued the inquisitive
stranger.retorted Cuddie, with a knowing look, or what he designed for
such,--"there's nae use in telling that, unless I kend wha was asking
me.""I commend your prudence, but it is unnecessary; I know you acted on that
occasion as servant to Henry Morton."said Cuddie, in surprise, "how came ye by that secret?No that I
need care a bodee about it, for the sun's on our side o' the hedge now.I
wish my master were living to get a blink o't.""He was lost in the vessel gaun to that weary Holland,--clean lost; and
a' body perished, and my poor master amang them.Neither man nor mouse
was ever heard o' mair.""You had some regard for him, then?"His face was made of a fiddle, as they say, for a'
body that looked on him liked him.Oh, an ye
had but seen him down at the brigg there, fleeing about like a fleeing
dragon to gar folk fight that had unto little will till 't!There was he
and that sour Whigamore they ca'd Burley: if twa men could hae won a
field, we wadna hae gotten our skins paid that day.""You mention Burley: do you know if he yet lives?"Folk say he was abroad, and our sufferers wad
hold no communion wi' him, because o' his having murdered the archbishop.Sae he cam hame ten times dourer than ever, and broke aff wi' mony o' the
Presbyterians; and at this last coming of the Prince of Orange he could
get nae countenance nor command for fear of his deevilish temper, and he
hasna been heard of since; only some folk say that pride and anger hae
driven him clean wud.""And--and," said the traveller, after considerable hesitation,--"do you
know anything of Lord Evan dale?""<DW37> I ken onything o' Lord Evandale?Is not my young leddy up
by yonder at the house, that's as gude as married to him?""No, only what they ca' betrothed,--me and my wife were witnesses.It's
no mony months bypast; it was a lang courtship,--few folk kend the reason
by Jenny and mysell.I downa bide to see ye
sitting up there, and the clouds are casting up thick in the west ower
Glasgow-ward, and maist skeily folk think that bodes rain."In fact, a deep black cloud had already surmounted the setting sun; a few
large drops of rain fell, and the murmurs of distant thunder were heard."The deil's in this man," said Cuddie to himself; "I wish he would either
light aff or ride on, that he may quarter himsell in Hamilton or the
shower begin."But the rider sate motionless on his horse for two or three moments after
his last question, like one exhausted by some uncommon effort.At length,
recovering himself as if with a sudden and painful effort, he asked
Cuddie "if Lady Margaret Bellenden still lived.""She does," replied Cuddie, "but in a very sma' way.They hae been a sad
changed family since thae rough times began; they hae suffered eneugh
first and last,--and to lose the auld Tower and a' the bonny barony and
the holms that I hae pleughed sae often, and the Mains, and my kale-yard,
that I suld hae gotten back again, and a' for naething, as 'a body may
say, but just the want o' some bits of sheep-skin that were lost in the
confusion of the taking of Tillietudlem.""I have heard something of this," said the stranger, deepening his voice
and averting his head."I have some interest in the family, and would
willingly help them if I could.Can you give me a bed in your house
to-night, my friend?""It's but a corner of a place, sir," said Cuddie, "but we'se try, rather
than ye suld ride on in the rain and thunner; for, to be free wi' ye,
sir, I think ye seem no that ower weel.""I am liable to a dizziness," said the stranger, "but it will soon wear
off.""I ken we can gie ye a decent supper, sir," said Cuddie; "and we'll see
about a bed as weel as we can.We wad be laith a stranger suld lack what
we have, though we are jimply provided for in beds rather; for Jenny has
sae mony bairns (God bless them and her) that troth I maun speak to Lord
Evandale to gie us a bit eik, or outshot o' some sort, to the onstead.""I shall be easily accommodated," said the stranger, as he entered the
house."And ye may rely on your naig being weel sorted," said Cuddie; "I ken
weel what belangs to suppering a horse, and this is a very gude ane."Cuddie took the horse to the little cow-house, and called to his wife to
attend in the mean while to the stranger's accommodation.The officer
entered, and threw himself on a settle at some distance from the fire,
and carefully turning his back to the little lattice window.Headrigg, if the reader pleases, requested him to lay aside the
cloak, belt, and flapped hat which he wore upon his journey, but he
excused himself under pretence of feeling cold, and, to divert the time
till Cuddie's return, he entered into some chat with the children,
carefully avoiding, during the interval, the inquisitive glances of his
landlady.Our broken friendships we deplore,
                    And loves of youth that are no more.Cuddie soon returned, assuring the stranger, with a cheerful voice, "that
the horse was properly suppered up, and that the gudewife should make a
bed up for him at the house, mair purpose-like and comfortable than the
like o' them could gie him."said the stranger, with an interrupted and
broken voice."No, stir, they're awa wi' a' the servants,--they keep only twa nowadays,
and my gudewife there has the keys and the charge, though she's no a
fee'd servant.She has been born and bred in the family, and has a' trust
and management.If they were there, we behovedna to take sic freedom
without their order; but when they are awa, they will be weel pleased we
serve a stranger gentleman.Miss Bellenden wad help a' the haill warld,
an her power were as gude as her will; and her grandmother, Leddy
Margaret, has an unto respect for the gentry, and she's no ill to the
poor bodies neither.--And now, wife, what for are ye no getting forrit
wi' the sowens?""Never mind, lad," rejoined Jenny, "ye sall hae them in gude time; I ken
weel that ye like your brose het."Cuddie fidgeted and laughed with a peculiar expression of intelligence at
this repartee, which was followed by a dialogue of little consequence
betwixt his wife and him, in which the stranger took no share.At length
he suddenly interrupted them by the question: "Can you tell me when Lord
Evandale's marriage takes place?""Very soon, we expect," answered Jenny, before it was possible for her
husband to reply; "it wad hae been ower afore now, but for the death o'
auld Major Bellenden."said the stranger; "I heard at Edinburgh he was
no more."He couldna be said to haud up his head after his brother's wife and his
niece were turned out o' their ain house; and he had himsell sair
borrowing siller to stand the law,--but it was in the latter end o' King
James's days; and Basil Olifant, who claimed the estate, turned a <DW7>
to please the managers, and then naething was to be refused him.Sae the
law gaed again the leddies at last, after they had fought a weary sort o'
years about it; and, as I said before, the major ne'er held up his head
again.And then cam the pitting awa o' the Stewart line; and, though he
had but little reason to like them, he couldna brook that, and it clean
broke the heart o' him; and creditors cam to Charnwood and cleaned out a'
that was there,--he was never rich, the gude auld man, for he dow'd na
see onybody want.""He was indeed," said the stranger, with a faltering voice, "an admirable
man,--that is, I have heard that he was so.So the ladies were left
without fortune, as well as without a protector?""They will neither want the tane nor the tother while Lord Evandale
lives," said Jenny; "he has been a true friend in their griefs.E'en to
the house they live in is his lordship's; and never man, as my auld
gudemother used to say, since the days of the Patriarch Jacob, served sae
lang and sae sair for a wife as gude Lord Evandale has dune.""And why," said the stranger, with a voice that quivered with emotion,
"why was he not sooner rewarded by the object of his attachment?""There was the lawsuit to be ended," said Jenny readily, "forby many
other family arrangements.""Na, but," said Cuddie, "there was another reason forby; for the young
leddy--"

"Whisht, hand your tongue, and sup your sowens," said his wife; "I see
the gentleman's far frae weel, and downa eat our coarse supper.I wad
kill him a chicken in an instant.""There is no occasion," said the stranger; "I shall want only a glass of
water, and to be left alone.""You'll gie yoursell the trouble then to follow me," said Jenny, lighting
a small lantern, "and I'll show you the way."Cuddie also proffered his assistance; but his wife reminded him, "That
the bairns would be left to fight thegither, and coup ane anither into
the fire," so that he remained to take charge of the menage.His wife led the way up a little winding path, which, after threading
some thickets of sweetbrier and honeysuckle, conducted to the back-door
of a small garden.Jenny undid the latch, and they passed through an
old-fashioned flower-garden, with its clipped yew hedges and formal
parterres, to a glass-sashed door, which she opened with a master-key,
and lighting a candle, which she placed upon a small work-table, asked
pardon for leaving him there for a few minutes, until she prepared his
apartment.She did not exceed five minutes in these preparations; but
when she returned, was startled to find that the stranger had sunk
forward with his head upon the table, in what she at first apprehended to
be a swoon.As she advanced to him, however, she could discover by his
short-drawn sobs that it was a paroxysm of mental agony.She prudently
drew back until he raised his head, and then showing herself, without
seeming to have observed his agitation, informed him that his bed was
prepared.The stranger gazed at her a moment, as if to collect the sense
of her words.She repeated them; and only bending his head, as an
indication that he understood her, he entered the apartment, the door of
which she pointed out to him.It was a small bedchamber, used, as she
informed him, by Lord Evandale when a guest at Fairy Knowe, connecting,
on one side, with a little china-cabinet which opened to the garden, and
on the other, with a saloon, from which it was only separated by a thin
wainscot partition.Having wished the stranger better health and good
rest, Jenny descended as speedily as she could to her own mansion.she exclaimed to her helpmate as she entered, "I doubt
we're ruined folk!"returned the imperturbed
Cuddie, who was one of those persons who do not easily take alarm at
anything."Wha d' ye think yon gentleman is?Oh that ever ye suld hae asked him to
light here!""Why, wha the muckle deil d'ye say he is?There's nae law against
harbouring and intercommunicating now," said Cuddie; "sae, Whig or Tory,
what need we care wha he be?""Ay, but it's ane will ding Lord Evandale's marriage ajee yet, if it's
no the better looked to," said Jenny; "it's Miss Edith's first joe, your
ain auld maister, Cuddie."exclaimed Cuddie, starting up, "Crow ye that I am
blind?"Ay, but, Cuddie lad," replied Jenny, "though ye are no blind, ye are no
sae notice-taking as I am.""Weel, what for needs ye cast that up to me just now; or what did ye see
about the man that was like our Maister Harry?""I jaloused his keeping his face frae us,
and speaking wi' a madelike voice, sae I e'en tried him wi' some tales
o lang syne; and when I spake o' the brose, ye ken, he didna just
laugh,--he's ower grave for that nowadays, but he gae a gledge wi' his
ee that I kend he took up what I said.And a' his distress is about Miss
Edith's marriage; and I ne'er saw a man mair taen down wi' true love in
my days,--I might say man or woman, only I mind how ill Miss Edith was
when she first gat word that him and you (ye muckle graceless loon) were
coming against Tillietudlem wi' the rebels.--But what's the matter wi'
the man now?""What's the matter wi' me indeed!"said Cuddie, who was again hastily
putting on some of the garments he had stripped himself of; "am I no gaun
up this instant to see my maister?""Atweel, Cuddie, ye are gaun nae sic gate," said Jenny, coolly and
resolutely."D 'ye think I am to be John
Tamson's man, and maistered by women a' the days o' my life?""And whase man wad ye be?And wha wad ye hae to maister ye but me,
Cuddie, lad?""I'll gar ye comprehend in the making of a
hay-band.Naebody kens that this young gentleman is living but oursells;
and frae that he keeps himsell up sae close, I am judging that he's
purposing, if he fand Miss Edith either married, or just gaun to be
married, he wad just slide awa easy, and gie them nae mair trouble.But
if Miss Edith kend that he was living, and if she were standing before
the very minister wi' Lord Evandale when it was tauld to her, I'se
warrant she wad say No when she suld say Yes.""Weel," replied Cuddie, "and what's my business wi' that?If Miss Edith
likes her auld joe better than her new ane, what for suld she no be free
to change her mind like other folk?Ye ken, Jenny, Halliday aye threeps
he had a promise frae yoursell.""Halliday's a liar, and ye're naething but a gomeril to hearken till him,
Cuddie.And then for this leddy's choice, lack-a-day!ye may be sure a'
the gowd Mr.Morton has is on the outside o' his coat; and how can he
keep Leddy Margaret and the young leddy?""Nae doubt the auld laird left his
housekeeper the liferent, as he heard nought o' his nephew; but it's but
speaking the auld wife fair, and they may a' live brawly thegither, Leddy
Margaret and a'.""Rout tout, lad," replied Jenny; "ye ken them little to think leddies o'
their rank wad set up house wi' auld Ailie Wilson, when they're maist
ower proud to take favours frae Lord Evandale himsell.Na, na, they maun
follow the camp, if she tak Morton.""That wad sort ill wi' the auld leddy, to be sure," said Cuddie; "she wad
hardly win ower a lang day in the baggage-wain.""Then sic a flyting as there wad be between them, a' about Whig and
Tory," continued Jenny."To be sure," said Cuddie, "the auld leddy's unto kittle in thae
points.""And then, Cuddie," continued his helpmate, who had reserved her
strongest argument to the last, "if this marriage wi' Lord Evandale is
broken off, what comes o' our ain bit free house, and the kale-yard, and
the cow's grass?I trow that baith us and thae bonny bairns will be
turned on the wide warld!"Here Jenny began to whimper; Cuddie writhed himself this way and that
way, the very picture of indecision.At length he broke out, "Weel,
woman, canna ye tell us what we suld do, without a' this din about it?""Just do naething at a'," said Jenny."Never seem to ken onything about
this gentleman, and for your life say a word that he suld hae been here,
or up at the house!An I had kend, I wad hae gien him my ain bed, and
sleepit in the byre or he had gane up by; but it canna be helpit now.The
neist thing's to get him cannily awa the morn, and I judge he'll be in
nae hurry to come back again."said Cuddie; "and maun I no speak to him, then?""For your life, no," said Jenny."Ye're no obliged to ken him; and I
wadna hae tauld ye, only I feared ye wad ken him in the morning.""Aweel," said Cuddie, sighing heavily, "I'se awa to pleugh the outfield
then; for if I am no to speak to him, I wad rather be out o' the gate.""Very right, my dear hinny," replied Jenny."Naebody has better sense than
you when ye crack a bit wi' me ower your affairs; but ye suld ne'er do
onything aff hand out o' your ain head.""Ane wad think it's true," quoth Cuddie; "for I hae aye had some carline
or quean or another to gar me gang their gate instead o' my ain.There
was first my mither," he continued, as he undressed and tumbled himself
into bed; "then there was Leddy Margaret didna let me ca' my soul my ain;
then my mither and her quarrelled, and pu'ed me twa ways at anes, as if
ilk ane had an end o' me, like Punch and the Deevil rugging about the
Baker at the fair; and now I hae gotten a wife," he murmured in
continuation, as he stowed the blankets around his person, "and she's
like to tak the guiding o' me a' thegither.""And amna I the best guide ye ever had in a' your life?"said Jenny, as
she closed the conversation by assuming her place beside her husband and
extinguishing the candle.Leaving this couple to their repose, we have next to inform the reader
that, early on the next morning, two ladies on horseback, attended by
their servants, arrived at the house of Fairy Knowe, whom, to Jenny's
utter confusion, she instantly recognised as Miss Bellenden and Lady
Emily Hamilton, a sister of Lord Evandale."Had I no better gang to the house to put things to rights?"said Jenny,
confounded with this unexpected apparition."We want nothing but the pass-key," said Miss Bellenden; "Gudyill will
open the windows of the little parlour.""The little parlour's locked, and the lock's, spoiled," answered Jenny,
who recollected the local spmpathy between that apartment and the
bedchamber of her guest."In the red parlour, then," said Miss Bellenden, and rode up to the front
of the house, but by an approach different from that through which Morton
had been conducted."All will be out," thought Jenny, "unless I can get him smuggled out of
the house the back way."So saying, she sped up the bank in great tribulation and uncertainty."I had better hae said at ante there was a stranger there," was her next
natural reflection."But then they wad hae been for asking him to
breakfast.what will I do?--And there's Gudyill walking in
the garden too!"she exclaimed internally on approaching the wicket; "and
I daurna gang in the back way till he's aff the coast.In this state of perplexity she approached the cidevant butler, with the
purpose of decoying him out of the garden.But John Gudyill's temper was
not improved by his decline in rank and increase in years.Like many
peevish people, too, he seemed to have an intuitive perception as to what
was most likely to teaze those whom he conversed with; and, on the
present occasion, all Jenny's efforts to remove him from the garden
served only to root him in it as fast as if he had been one of the
shrubs.Unluckily, also, he had commenced florist during his residence at Fairy
Knowe; and, leaving all other things to the charge of Lady Emily's
servant, his first care was dedicated to the flowers, which he had taken
under his special protection, and which he propped, dug, and watered,
prosing all the while upon their respective merits to poor Jenny, who
stood by him trembling and almost crying with anxiety, fear, and
impatience.Fate seemed determined to win a match against Jenny this unfortunate
morning.As soon as the ladies entered the house, they observed that the
door of the little parlour--the very apartment out of which she was
desirous of excluding them on account of its contiguity to the room in
which Morton slept--was not only unlocked, but absolutely ajar.Miss
Bellenden was too much engaged with her own immediate subjects of
reflection to take much notice of the circumstance, but, desiring the
servant to open the window-shutters, walked into the room along with her
friend."He is not yet come," she said.Why
express so anxious a wish that we should meet him here?And why not come
to Castle Dinnan, as he proposed?I own, my dear Emily, that, even
engaged as we are to each other, and with the sanction of your presence,
I do not feel that I have done quite right in indulging him.""Evandale was never capricious," answered his sister; "I am sure he will
satisfy us with his reasons, and if he does not, I will help you to scold
him.""What I chiefly fear," said Edith, "is his having engaged in some of the
plots of this fluctuating and unhappy time.I know his heart is with that
dreadful Claverhouse and his army, and I believe he would have joined
them ere now but for my uncle's death, which gave him so much additional
trouble on our account.How singular that one so rational and so deeply
sensible of the errors of the exiled family should be ready to risk all
for their restoration!"answered Lady Emily,--"it is a point of honour with
Evandale.Our family have always been loyal; he served long in the
Guards; the Viscount of Dundee was his commander and his friend for
years; he is looked on with an evil eye by many of his own relations, who
set down his inactivity to the score of want of spirit.You must be
aware, my dear Edith, how often family connections and early
predilections influence our actions more than abstract arguments.But I
trust Evandale will continue quiet,--though, to tell you truth, I believe
you are the only one who can keep him so.""You can furnish him with the Scriptural apology for not going forth with
the host,--'he has married a wife, and therefore cannot come.'""I have promised," said Edith, in a faint voice; "but I trust I shall not
be urged on the score of time.""Nay," said Lady Emily, "I will leave Evandale (and here he comes) to
plead his own cause.""Stay, stay, for God's sake!"said Edith, endeavouring to detain her."Not I, not I," said the young lady, making her escape; "the third person
makes a silly figure on such occasions.When you want me for breakfast, I
will be found in the willow-walk by the river."As she tripped out of the room, Lord Evandale entered."Good-morrow,
Brother, and good-by till breakfast-time," said the lively young lady;
"I trust you will give Miss Bellenden some good reasons for disturbing
her rest so early in the morning."And so saying, she left them together, without waiting a reply."And now, my lord," said Edith, "may I desire to know the meaning of your
singular request to meet you here at so early an hour?"She was about to add that she hardly felt herself excusable in having
complied with it; but upon looking at the person whom she addressed, she
was struck dumb by the singular and agitated expression of his
countenance, and interrupted herself to exclaim, "For God's sake, what is
the matter?""His Majesty's faithful subjects have gained a great and most decisive
victory near Blair of Athole; but, alas!my gallant friend Lord Dundee--"

"Has fallen?"said Edith, anticipating the rest of his tidings."True, most true: he has fallen in the arms of victory, and not a man
remains of talents and influence sufficient to fill up his loss in King
James's service.This, Edith, is no time for temporizing with our duty.I
have given directions to raise my followers, and I must take leave of you
this evening.""Do not think of it, my lord," answered Edith; "your life is--essential
to your friends,--do not throw it away in an adventure so rash.What can
your single arm, and the few tenants or servants who might follow you, do
against the force of almost all Scotland, the Highland clans only
excepted?""Listen to me, Edith," said Lord Evandale."I am not so rash as you may
suppose me, nor are my present motives of such light importance as to
affect only those personally dependent on myself.The Life Guards, with
whom I served so long, although new-modelled and new-officered by the
Prince of Orange, retain a predilection for the cause of their rightful
master; and "--and here he whispered as if he feared even the walls of
the apartment had ears--"when my foot is known to be in the stirrup, two
regiments of cavalry have sworn to renounce the usurper's service, and
fight under my orders.They delayed only till Dundee should descend into
the Lowlands; but since he is no more, which of his successors dare take
that decisive step, unless encouraged by the troops declaring themselves!Meantime, the zeal of the soldiers will die away.I must bring them to a
decision while their hearts are glowing with the victory their old leader
has obtained, and burning to avenge his untimely death.""And will you, on the faith of such men as you know these soldiers to
be," said Edith, "take a part of such dreadful moment?""I will," said Lord Evandale,--"I must; my honour and loyalty are both
pledged for it.""And all for the sake," continued Miss Bellenden, "of a prince whose
measures, while he was on the throne, no one could condemn more than Lord
Evandale?""Most true," replied Lord Evandale; "and as I resented, even during the
plenitude of his power, his innovations on Church and State, like a
freeborn subject, I am determined I will assert his real rights, when he
is in adversity, like a loyal one.Let courtiers and sycophants flatter
power and desert misfortune; I will neither do the one nor the other.""And if you are determined to act what my feeble judgment must still term
rashly, why give yourself the pain of this untimely meeting?""Were it not enough to answer," said Lord Evandale, "that, ere rushing on
battle, I wished to bid adieu to my betrothed bride?Surely it is judging
coldly of my feelings, and showing too plainly the indifference of your
own, to question my motive for a request so natural.""But why in this place, my lord," said Edith; "and why with such peculiar
circumstances of mystery?""Because," he replied, putting a letter into her hand, "I have yet
another request, which I dare hardly proffer, even when prefaced by these
credentials."In haste and terror, Edith glanced over the letter, which was from her
grandmother."My dearest childe," such was its tenor in style and spelling, "I
     never more deeply regretted the reumatizm, which disqualified me
     from riding on horseback, than at this present writing, when I would
     most have wished to be where this paper will soon be, that is at
     Fairy Knowe, with my poor dear Willie's only child.But it is the
     will of God I should not be with her, which I conclude to be the
     case, as much for the pain I now suffer, as because it hath now not
     given way either to cammomile poultices or to decoxion of wild
     mustard, wherewith I have often relieved others.Therefore, I must
     tell you, by writing instead of word of mouth, that, as my young
     Lord Evandale is called to the present campaign, both by his honour
     and his duty, he hath earnestly solicited me that the bonds of holy
     matrimony be knitted before his departure to the wars between you
     and him, in implement of the indenture formerly entered into for
     that effeck, whereuntill, as I see no raisonable objexion, so I
     trust that you, who have been always a good and obedient childe,
     will not devize any which has less than raison.It is trew that the
     contrax of our house have heretofore been celebrated in a manner
     more befitting our Rank, and not in private, and with few witnesses,
     as a thing done in a corner.But it has been Heaven's own free will,
     as well as those of the kingdom where we live, to take away from us
     our estate, and from the King his throne.Yet I trust He will yet
     restore the rightful heir to the throne, and turn his heart to the
     true Protestant Episcopal faith, which I have the better right to
     expect to see even with my old eyes, as I have beheld the royal
     family when they were struggling as sorely with masterful usurpers
     and rebels as they are now; that is to say, when his most sacred
     Majesty, Charles the Second of happy memory, honoured our poor house
     of Tillietudlem by taking his _disjune_ therein," etc., etc., etc.We will not abuse the reader's patience by quoting more of Lady
Margaret's prolix epistle.Suffice it to say that it closed by laying her
commands on her grandchild to consent to the solemnization of her
marriage without loss of time."I never thought till this instant," said Edith, dropping the letter from
her hand, "that Lord Evandale would have acted ungenerously.""And how can you apply such a
term to my desire to call you mine, ere I part from you, perhaps for
ever?""Lord Evandale ought to have remembered," said Edith, "that when his
perseverance, and, I must add, a due sense of his merit and of the
obligations we owed him, wrung from me a slow consent that I would one
day comply with his wishes, I made it my condition that I should not be
pressed to a hasty accomplishment of my promise; and now he avails
himself of his interest with my only remaining relative to hurry me with
precipitate and even indelicate importunity.There is more selfishness
than generosity, my lord, in such eager and urgent solicitation."Lord Evandale, evidently much hurt, took two or three turns through the
apartment ere he replied to this accusation; at length he spoke: "I
should have escaped this painful charge, durst I at once have mentioned
to Miss Bellendon my principal reason for urging this request.It is one
which she will probably despise on her own account, but which ought to
weigh with her for the sake of Lady Margaret.My death in battle must
give my whole estate to my heirs of entail; my forfeiture as a traitor,
by the usurping Government, may vest it in the Prince of Orange or some
Dutch favourite.In either case, my venerable friend and betrothed bride
must remain unprotected and in poverty.Vested with the rights and
provisions of Lady Evandale, Edith will find, in the power of supporting
her aged parent, some consolation for having condescended to share the
titles and fortunes of one who does not pretend to be worthy of her."Edith was struck dumb by an argument which she had not expected, and was
compelled to acknowledge that Lord Evandale's suit was urged with
delicacy as well as with consideration."And yet," she said, "such is the waywardness with which my heart reverts
to former times that I cannot," she burst into tears, "suppress a degree
of ominous reluctance at fulfilling my engagement upon such a brief
summons.""We have already fully considered this painful subject," said Lord
Evandale; "and I hoped, my dear Edith, your own inquiries, as well as
mine, had fully convinced you that these regrets were fruitless."said Edith, with a deep sigh, which, as if by an
unexpected echo, was repeated from the adjoining apartment.Miss
Bellenden started at the sound, and scarcely composed herself upon Lord
Evandale's assurances that she had heard but the echo of her own
respiration."It sounded strangely distinct," she said, "and almost ominous; but my
feelings are so harassed that the slightest trifle agitates them."Lord Evandale eagerly attempted to soothe her alarm, and reconcile her to
a measure which, however hasty, appeared to him the only means by which
he could secure her independence.He urged his claim in virtue of the
contract, her grandmother's wish and command, the propriety of insuring
her comfort and independence, and touched lightly on his own long
attachment, which he had evinced by so many and such various services.These Edith felt the more, the less they were insisted upon; and at
length, as she had nothing to oppose to his ardour, excepting a causeless
reluctance which she herself was ashamed to oppose against so much
generosity, she was compelled to rest upon the impossibility of having
the ceremony performed upon such hasty notice, at such a time and place.But for all this Lord Evandale was prepared, and he explained, with
joyful alacrity, that the former chaplain of his regiment was in
attendance at the Lodge with a faithful domestic, once a non-commissioned
officer in the same corps; that his sister was also possessed of the
secret; and that Headrigg and his wife might be added to the list of
witnesses, if agreeable to Miss Bellenden.As to the place, he had chosen
it on very purpose.The marriage was to remain a secret, since Lord
Evandale was to depart in disguise very soon after it was solemnized,--a
circumstance which, had their union been public, must have drawn upon him
the attention of the Government, as being altogether unaccountable,
unless from his being engaged in some dangerous design.Having hastily
urged these motives and explained his arrangements, he ran, without
waiting for an answer, to summon his sister to attend his bride, while he
went in search of the other persons whose presence was necessary.When Lady Emily arrived, she found her friend in an agony of tears, of
which she was at some loss to comprehend the reason, being one of those
damsels who think there is nothing either wonderful or terrible in
matrimony, and joining with most who knew him in thinking that it could
not be rendered peculiarly alarming by Lord Evandale being the
bridegroom.Influenced by these feelings, she exhausted in succession all
the usual arguments for courage, and all the expressions of sympathy and
condolence ordinarily employed on such occasions.But when Lady Emily
beheld her future sister-in-law deaf to all those ordinary topics of
consolation; when she beheld tears follow fast and without intermission
down cheeks as pale as marble; when she felt that the hand which she
pressed in order to enforce her arguments turned cold within her grasp,
and lay, like that of a corpse, insensible and unresponsive to her
caresses, her feelings of sympathy gave way to those of hurt pride and
pettish displeasure."I must own," she said, "that I am something at a loss to understand all
this, Miss Bellenden.Months have passed since you agreed to marry my
brother, and you have postponed the fulfilment of your engagement from
one period to another, as if you had to avoid some dishonourable or
highly disagreeable connection.I think I can answer for Lord Evandale
that he will seek no woman's hand against her inclination; and, though
his sister, I may boldly say that he does not need to urge any lady
further than her inclinations carry her.You will forgive me, Miss
Bellenden; but your present distress augurs ill for my brother's future
happiness, and I must needs say that he does not merit all these
expressions of dislike and dolour, and that they seem an odd return for
an attachment which he has manifested so long, and in so many ways.""You are right, Lady Emily," said Edith, drying her eyes and endeavouring
to resume her natural manner, though still betrayed by her faltering
voice and the paleness of her cheeks,--"you are quite right; Lord
Evandale merits such usage from no one, least of all from her whom he has
honoured with his regard.But if I have given way, for the last time, to
a sudden and irresistible burst of feeling, it is my consolation, Lady
Emily, that your brother knows the cause, that I have hid nothing from
him, and that he at least is not apprehensive of finding in Edith
Bellenden a wife undeserving of his affection.But still you are right,
and I merit your censure for indulging for a moment fruitless regret and
painful remembrances.It shall be so no longer; my lot is cast with
Evandale, and with him I am resolved to bear it.Nothing shall in future
occur to excite his complaints or the resentment of his relations; no
idle recollections of other days shall intervene to prevent the zealous
and affectionate discharge of my duty; no vain illusions recall the
memory of other days--"

As she spoke these words, she slowly raised her eyes, which had before
been hidden by her hand, to the latticed window of her apartment, which
was partly open, uttered a dismal shriek, and fainted.Lady Emily turned
her eyes in the same direction, but saw only the shadow of a man, which
seemed to disappear from the window, and, terrified more by the state of
Edith than by the apparition she had herself witnessed, she uttered
shriek upon shriek for assistance.Her brother soon arrived, with the
chaplain and Jenny Dennison; but strong and vigorous remedies were
necessary ere they could recall Miss Bellenden to sense and motion.Even
then her language was wild and incoherent.[Illustration: Uttered A Dismal Shriek, And Fainted--224]


"Press me no farther," she said to Lord Evandale,--"it cannot be; Heaven
and earth, the living and the dead, have leagued themselves against this
ill-omened union.Take all I can give,--my sisterly regard, my devoted
friendship.I will love you as a sister and serve you as a bondswoman,
but never speak to me more of marriage."The astonishment of Lord Evandale may easily be conceived."Emily," he said to his sister, "this is your doing.I was accursed when
I thought of bringing you here; some of your confounded folly has driven
her mad!""On my word, Brother," answered Lady Emily, "you're sufficient to drive
all the women in Scotland mad.Because your mistress seems much disposed
to jilt you, you quarrel with your sister, who has been arguing in your
cause, and had brought her to a quiet hearing, when, all of a sudden, a
man looked in at a window, whom her crazed sensibility mistook either for
you or some one else, and has treated us gratis with an excellent tragic
scene."said Lord Evandale, in impatient displeasure."Miss Bellenden is incapable of trifling with me; and yet what else could
have--"

"Hush!said Jenny, whose interest lay particularly in shifting
further inquiry; "for Heaven's sake, my lord, speak low, for my lady
begins to recover."Edith was no sooner somewhat restored to herself than she begged, in a
feeble voice, to be left alone with Lord Evandale.All retreated,--Jenny
with her usual air of officious simplicity, Lady Emily and the chaplain
with that of awakened curiosity.No sooner had they left the apartment
than Edith beckoned Lord Evandale to sit beside her on the couch; her
next motion was to take his hand, in spite of his surprised resistance,
to her lips; her last was to sink from her seat and to clasp his knees.I must deal most
untruly by you, and break a solemn engagement.You have my friendship, my
highest regard, my most sincere gratitude; you have more,--you have my
word and my faith; but--oh, forgive me, for the fault is not mine--you
have not my love, and I cannot marry you without a sin!""You dream, my dearest Edith!"said Evandale, perplexed in the utmost
degree, "you let your imagination beguile you; this is but some delusion
of an over-sensitive mind.The person whom you preferred to me has been
long in a better world, where your unavailing regret cannot follow him,
or, if it could, would only diminish his happiness.""You are mistaken, Lord Evandale," said Edith, solemnly; "I am not a
sleep-walker or a madwoman.No, I could not have believed from any one
what I have seen.But, having seen him, I must believe mine own eyes."asked Lord Evandale, in great anxiety."Henry Morton," replied Edith, uttering these two words as if they were
her last, and very nearly fainting when she had done so."Miss Bellenden," said Lord Evandale, "you treat me like a fool or a
child.If you repent your engagement to me," he continued, indignantly,
"I am not a man to enforce it against your inclination; but deal with me
as a man, and forbear this trifling."He was about to go on, when he perceived, from her quivering eye and
pallid cheek, that nothing less than imposture was intended, and that by
whatever means her imagination had been so impressed, it was really
disturbed by unaffected awe and terror.He changed his tone, and exerted
all his eloquence in endeavouring to soothe and extract from her the
secret cause of such terror.she repeated,--"I saw Henry Morton stand at that window, and
look into the apartment at the moment I was on the point of abjuring him
for ever.His face was darker, thinner, and paler than it was wont to be;
his dress was a horseman's cloak, and hat looped down over his face; his
expression was like that he wore on that dreadful morning when he was
examined by Claverhouse at Tillietudlem.Ask your sister, ask Lady Emily,
if she did not see him as well as I. I know what has called him up,--he
came to upbraid me, that, while my heart was with him in the deep and
dead sea, I was about to give my hand to another.My lord, it is ended
between you and me; be the consequences what they will, she cannot marry
whose union disturbs the repose of the dead."said Evandale, as he paced the room, half mad himself with
surprise and vexation, "her fine understanding must be totally
overthrown, and that by the effort which she has made to comply with my
ill-timed, though well-meant, request.Without rest and attention her
health is ruined for ever."At this moment the door opened, and Halliday, who had been Lord
Evandale's principal personal attendant since they both left the Guards
on the Revolution, stumbled into the room with a countenance as pale and
ghastly as terror could paint it."What is the matter next, Halliday?""Any
discovery of the--"

He had just recollection sufficient to stop short in the midst of the
dangerous sentence."No, sir," said Halliday, "it is not that, nor anything like that; but I
have seen a ghost!"said Lord Evandale, forced altogether out
of his patience."Has all mankind sworn to go mad in order to drive me
so?"The ghost of Henry Morton, the Whig captain at Bothwell Bridge," replied
Halliday."He passed by me like a fire-flaught when I was in the garden!""This is midsummer madness," said Lord Evandale, "or there is some
strange villainy afloat.Jenny, attend your lady to her chamber, while I
endeavour to find a clue to all this."But Lord Evandale's inquiries were in vain.Jenny, who might have given
(had she chosen) a very satisfactory explanation, had an interest to
leave the matter in darkness; and interest was a matter which now weighed
principally with Jenny, since the possession of an active and
affectionate husband in her own proper right had altogether allayed her
spirit of coquetry.She had made the best use of the first moments of
confusion hastily to remove all traces of any one having slept in the
apartment adjoining to the parlour, and even to erase the mark of
footsteps beneath the window, through which she conjectured Morton's face
had been seen, while attempting, ere he left the garden, to gain one look
at her whom he had so long loved, and was now on the point of losing for
ever.That he had passed Halliday in the garden was equally clear; and
she learned from her elder boy, whom she had employed to have the
stranger's horse saddled and ready for his departure, that he had rushed
into the stable, thrown the child a broad gold piece, and, mounting his
horse, had ridden with fearful rapidity down towards the Clyde.The
secret was, therefore, in their own family, and Jenny was resolved it
should remain so."For, to be sure," she said, "although her lady and Halliday kend Mr.Morton by broad daylight, that was nae reason I suld own to kenning him
in the gloaming and by candlelight, and him keeping his face frae Cuddie
and me a' the time."So she stood resolutely upon the negative when examined by Lord Evandale.As for Halliday, he could only say that as he entered the garden-door,
the supposed apparition met him, walking swiftly, and with a visage on
which anger and grief appeared to be contending."He knew him well," he said, "having been repeatedly guard upon him, and
obliged to write down his marks of stature and visage in case of escape.But what should make him
haunt the country where he was neither hanged nor shot, he, the said
Halliday, did not pretend to conceive.Lady Emily confessed she had seen the face of a man at the window, but
her evidence went no farther.John Gudyill deponed _nil novit in causa_.He had left his gardening to get his morning dram just at the time when
the apparition had taken place.Lady Emily's servant was waiting orders
in the kitchen, and there was not another being within a quarter of a
mile of the house.Lord Evandale returned perplexed and dissatisfied in the highest degree
at beholding a plan which he thought necessary not less for the
protection of Edith in contingent circumstances, than for the assurance
of his own happiness, and which he had brought so very near perfection,
thus broken off without any apparent or rational cause.His knowledge of
Edith's character set her beyond the suspicion of covering any capricious
change of determination by a pretended vision.But he would have set the
apparition down to the influence of an overstrained imagination, agitated
by the circumstances in which she had so suddenly been placed, had it not
been for the coinciding testimony of Halliday, who had no reason for
thinking of Morton more than any other person, and knew nothing of Miss
Bellenden's vision when he promulgated his own.On the other hand, it
seemed in the highest degree improbable that Morton, so long and so
vainly sought after, and who was, with such good reason, supposed to be
lost when the "Vryheid" of Rotterdam went down with crew and passengers,
should be alive and lurking in this country, where there was no longer
any reason why he should not openly show himself, since the present
Government favoured his party in politics.When Lord Evandale reluctantly
brought himself to communicate these doubts to the chaplain, in order to
obtain his opinion, he could only obtain a long lecture on demonology, in
which, after quoting Delrio and Burthoog and De L'Ancre on the subject of
apparitions, together with sundry civilians and common lawyers on the
nature of testimony, the learned gentleman expressed his definite and
determined opinion to be, either that there had been an actual apparition
of the deceased Henry Morton's spirit, the possibility of which he was,
as a divine and a philosopher, neither fully prepared to admit or to
deny; or else that the said Henry Morton, being still in _rerum natura_,
had appeared in his proper person that morning; or, finally, that some
strong _deceptio visus_, or striking similitude of person, had deceived
the eyes of Miss Bellenden and of Thomas Halliday.Which of these was the
most probable hypothesis, the doctor declined to pronounce, but expressed
himself ready to die in the opinion that one or other of them had
occasioned that morning's disturbance.Lord Evandale soon had additional cause for distressful anxiety.Miss
Bellenden was declared to be dangerously ill."I will not leave this place," he exclaimed, "till she is pronounced to
be in safety.I neither can nor ought to do so; for whatever may have
been the immediate occasion of her illness, I gave the first cause for it
by my unhappy solicitation."He established himself, therefore, as a guest in the family, which the
presence of his sister, as well as of Lady Margaret Bellenden (who, in
despite of her rheumatism, caused herself to be transported thither when
she heard of her granddaughter's illness), rendered a step equally
natural and delicate.And thus he anxiously awaited until, without injury
to her health, Edith could sustain a final explanation ere his departure
on his expedition."She shall never," said the generous young man, "look on her engagement
with me as the means of fettering her to a union, the idea of which seems
almost to unhinge her understanding."Where once my careless childhood strayed,
               A stranger yet to pain.Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College.It is not by corporal wants and infirmities only that men of the most
distinguished talents are levelled, during their lifetime, with the
common mass of mankind.There are periods of mental agitation when the
firmest of mortals must be ranked with the weakest of his brethren, and
when, in paying the general tax of humanity, his distresses are even
aggravated by feeling that he transgresses, in the indulgence of his
grief, the rules of religion and philosophy by which he endeavours in
general to regulate his passions and his actions.It was during such a
paroxysm that the unfortunate Morton left Fairy Knowe.To know that his
long-loved and still-beloved Edith, whose image had filled his mind for
so many years, was on the point of marriage to his early rival, who had
laid claim to her heart by so many services as hardly left her a title to
refuse his addresses, bitter as the intelligence was, yet came not as an
unexpected blow.During his residence abroad he had once written to Edith.It was to bid
her farewell for ever, and to conjure her to forget him.He had requested
her not to answer his letter; yet he half hoped, for many a day, that she
might transgress his injunction.The letter never reached her to whom it
was addressed, and Morton, ignorant of its miscarriage, could only
conclude himself laid aside and forgotten, according to his own
self-denying request.All that he had heard of their mutual relations
since his return to Scotland prepared him to expect that he could only
look upon Miss Bellenden as the betrothed bride of Lord Evandale; and
even if freed from the burden of obligation to the latter, it would still
have been inconsistent with Morton's generosity of disposition to disturb
their arrangements, by attempting the assertion of a claim proscribed by
absence, never sanctioned by the consent of friends, and barred by a
thousand circumstances of difficulty.Why then did he seek the cottage
which their broken fortunes had now rendered the retreat of Lady Margaret
Bellenden and her granddaughter?He yielded, we are under the necessity
of acknowledging, to the impulse of an inconsistent wish which many might
have felt in his situation.Accident apprised him, while travelling towards his native district, that
the ladies, near whose mansion he must necessarily pass, were absent; and
learning that Cuddie and his wife acted as their principal domestics, he
could not resist pausing at their cottage to learn, if possible, the real
progress which Lord Evandale had made in the affections of Miss Bellen
den--alas!This rash experiment ended as we have
related, and he parted from the house of Fairy Knowe, conscious that he
was still beloved by Edith, yet compelled, by faith and honour, to
relinquish her for ever.With what feelings he must have listened to the
dialogue between Lord Evandale and Edith, the greater part of which he
involuntarily overheard, the reader must conceive, for we dare not
attempt to describe them.An hundred times he was tempted to burst upon
their interview, or to exclaim aloud, "Edith, I yet live!"and as often
the recollection of her plighted troth, and of the debt of gratitude
which he owed Lord Evandale (to whose influence with Claverhouse he
justly ascribed his escape from torture and from death), withheld him
from a rashness which might indeed have involved all in further distress,
but gave little prospect of forwarding his own happiness.He repressed
forcibly these selfish emotions, though with an agony which thrilled his
every nerve.was his internal oath, "never will I add a thorn to thy
pillow.That which Heaven has ordained, let it be; and let me not add, by
my selfish sorrows, one atom's weight to the burden thou hast to bear.I
was dead to thee when thy resolution was adopted; and never, never shalt
thou know that Henry Morton still lives!"As he formed this resolution, diffident of his own power to keep it, and
seeking that firmness in flight which was every moment shaken by his
continuing within hearing of Edith's voice, he hastily rushed from his
apartment by the little closet and the sashed door which led to the
garden.But firmly as he thought his resolution was fixed, he could not leave the
spot where the last tones of a voice so beloved still vibrated on his
ear, without endeavouring to avail himself of the opportunity which the
parlour window afforded to steal one last glance at the lovely speaker.It was in this attempt, made while Edith seemed to have her eyes
unalterably bent upon the ground, that Morton's presence was detected by
her raising them suddenly.So soon as her wild scream made this known to
the unfortunate object of a passion so constant, and which seemed so
ill-fated, he hurried from the place as if pursued by the furies.He
passed Halliday in the garden without recognising or even being sensible
that he had seen him, threw himself on his horse, and, by a sort of
instinct rather than recollection, took the first by-road in preference
to the public route to Hamilton.In all probability this prevented Lord Evandale from learning that he was
actually in existence; for the news that the Highlanders had obtained a
decisive victory at Killiecrankie had occasioned an accurate look-out to
be kept, by order of the Government, on all the passes, for fear of some
commotion among the Lowland Jacobites.They did not omit to post
sentinels on Bothwell Bridge; and as these men had not seen any traveller
pass westward in that direction, and as, besides, their comrades
stationed in the village of Bothwell were equally positive that none had
gone eastward, the apparition, in the existence of which Edith and
Halliday were equally positive, became yet more mysterious in the
judgment of Lord Evandale, who was finally inclined to settle in the
belief that the heated and disturbed imagination of Edith had summoned up
the phantom she stated herself to have seen, and that Halliday had, in
some unaccountable manner, been infected by the same superstition.Meanwhile, the by-path which Morton pursued, with all the speed which his
vigorous horse could exert, brought him in a very few seconds to the
brink of the Clyde, at a spot marked with the feet of horses, who were
conducted to it as a watering-place.The steed, urged as he was to the
gallop, did not pause a single instant, but, throwing himself into the
river, was soon beyond his depth.The plunge which the animal made as his
feet quitted the ground, with the feeling that the cold water rose above
his swordbelt, were the first incidents which recalled Morton, whose
movements had been hitherto mechanical, to the necessity of taking
measures for preserving himself and the noble animal which he bestrode.A
perfect master of all manly exercises, the management of a horse in water
was as familiar to him as when upon a meadow.He directed the animal's
course somewhat down the stream towards a low plain, or holm, which
seemed to promise an easy egress from the river.In the first and second
attempt to get on shore, the horse was frustrated by the nature of the
ground, and nearly fell backwards on his rider.The instinct of
self-preservation seldom fails, even in the most desperate circumstances,
to recall the human mind to some degree of equipoise, unless when
altogether distracted by terror, and Morton was obliged to the danger in
which he was placed for complete recovery of his self-possession.A third
attempt, at a spot more carefully and judiciously selected, succeeded
better than the former, and placed the horse and his rider in safety upon
the farther and left-hand bank of the Clyde."But whither," said Morton, in the bitterness of his heart, "am I now to
direct my course?or rather, what does it signify to which point of the
compass a wretch so forlorn betakes himself?I would to God, could the
wish be without a sin, that these dark waters had flowed over me, and
drowned my recollection of that which was, and that which is!"The sense of impatience, which the disturbed state of his feelings had
occasioned, scarcely had vented itself in these violent expressions, ere
he was struck with shame at having given way to such a paroxysm.He
remembered how signally the life which he now held so lightly in the
bitterness of his disappointment had been preserved through the almost
incessant perils which had beset him since he entered upon his public
career.he said, "and worse than a fool, to set light by that
existence which Heaven has so often preserved in the most marvellous
manner.Something there yet remains for me in this world, were it only to
bear my sorrows like a man, and to aid those who need my assistance.What
have I seen, what have I heard, but the very conclusion of that which I
knew was to happen?They"--he durst not utter their names even in
soliloquy--"they are embarrassed and in difficulties.She is stripped of
her inheritance, and he seems rushing on some dangerous career, with
which, but for the low voice in which he spoke, I might have become
acquainted.Are there no means to aid or to warn them?"As he pondered upon this topic, forcibly withdrawing his mind from his
own disappointment, and compelling his attention to the affairs of Edith
and her betrothed husband, the letter of Burley, long forgotten, suddenly
rushed on his memory, like a ray of light darting through a mist."Their ruin must have been his work," was his internal conclusion."If it
can be repaired, it must be through his means, or by information obtained
from him.Stern, crafty, and enthusiastic as he
is, my plain and downright rectitude of purpose has more than once
prevailed with him.I will seek him out, at least; and who knows what
influence the information I may acquire from him may have on the fortunes
of those whom I shall never see more, and who will probably never learn
that I am now suppressing my own grief, to add, if possible, to their
happiness."Animated by these hopes, though the foundation was but slight, he sought
the nearest way to the high-road; and as all the tracks through the
valley were known to him since he hunted through them in youth, he had no
other difficulty than that of surmounting one or two enclosures, ere he
found himself on the road to the small burgh where the feast of the
popinjay had been celebrated.He journeyed in a state of mind sad indeed
and dejected, yet relieved from its earlier and more intolerable state of
anguish; for virtuous resolution and manly disinterestedness seldom fail
to restore tranquillity even where they cannot create happiness.He
turned his thoughts with strong effort upon the means of discovering
Burley, and the chance there was of extracting from him any knowledge
which he might possess favourable to her in whose cause he interested
himself; and at length formed the resolution of guiding himself by the
circumstances in which he might discover the object of his quest,
trusting that, from Cuddie's account of a schism betwixt Burley and his
brethren of the Presbyterian persuasion, he might find him less
rancorously disposed against Miss Bellenden, and inclined to exert the
power which he asserted himself to possess over her fortunes, more
favourably than heretofore.Noontide had passed away when our traveller found himself in the
neighbourhood of his deceased uncle's habitation of Milnwood.It rose
among glades and groves that were chequered with a thousand early
recollections of joy and sorrow, and made upon Morton that mournful
impression, soft and affecting, yet, withal, soothing, which the
sensitive mind usually receives from a return to the haunts of childhood
and early youth, after having experienced the vicissitudes and tempests
of public life.A strong desire came upon him to visit the house itself."Old Alison," he thought, "will not know me, more than the honest couple
whom I saw yesterday.I may indulge my curiosity, and proceed on my
journey, without her having any knowledge of my existence.I think they
said my uncle had bequeathed to her my family mansion,--well, be it so.I
have enough to sorrow for, to enable me to dispense with lamenting such a
disappointment as that; and yet methinks he has chosen an odd successor
in my grumbling old dame, to a line of respectable, if not distinguished,
ancestry.Let it be as it may, I will visit the old mansion at least once
more."The house of Milnwood, even in its best days, had nothing cheerful about
it; but its gloom appeared to be doubled under the auspices of the old
housekeeper.Everything, indeed, was in repair; there were no slates
deficient upon the steep grey roof, and no panes broken in the narrow
windows.But the grass in the court-yard looked as if the foot of man had
not been there for years; the doors were carefully locked, and that which
admitted to the hall seemed to have been shut for a length of time, since
the spiders had fairly drawn their webs over the door-way and the
staples.Living sight or sound there was none, until, after much
knocking, Morton heard the little window, through which it was
usual to reconnoitre visitors, open with much caution.The face of
Alison, puckered with some score of wrinkles in addition to those with
which it was furrowed when Morton left Scotland, now presented itself,
enveloped in a _toy_, from under the protection of which some of her grey
tresses had escaped in a manner more picturesque than beautiful, while
her shrill, tremulous voice demanded the cause of the knocking."I wish to speak an instant with one Alison Wilson, who resides here,"
said Henry."She's no at hame the day," answered Mrs.Wilson, _in propria persona_,
the state of whose headdress, perhaps, inspired her with this direct mode
of denying herself; "and ye are but a mislear'd person to speer for her
in sic a manner.Ye might hae had an M under your belt for Mistress
Wilson of Milnwood.""I beg pardon," said Morton, internally smiling at finding in old Ailie
the same jealousy of disrespect which she used to exhibit upon former
occasions,--"I beg pardon; I am but a stranger in this country, and have
been so long abroad that I have almost forgotten my own language."said Ailie; "then maybe ye may hae
heard of a young gentleman of this country that they ca' Henry Morton?""I have heard," said Morton, "of such a name in Germany.""Then bide a wee bit where ye are, friend; or stay,--gang round by the
back o' the house, and ye'll find a laigh door; it's on the latch, for
it's never barred till sunset.Ye 'll open 't,--and tak care ye dinna fa'
ower the tub, for the entry's dark,--and then ye'll turn to the right,
and then ye'll hand straught forward, and then ye'll turn to the right
again, and ye 'll tak heed o' the cellarstairs, and then ye 'll be at the
door o' the little kitchen,--it's a' the kitchen that's at Milnwood
now,--and I'll come down t'ye, and whate'er ye wad say to Mistress
Wilson ye may very safely tell it to me."A stranger might have had some difficulty, notwithstanding the minuteness
of the directions supplied by Ailie, to pilot himself in safety through
the dark labyrinth of passages that led from the back-door to the little
kitchen; but Henry was too well acquainted with the navigation of these
straits to experience danger, either from the Scylla which lurked on one
side in shape of a bucking tub, or the Charybdis which yawned on the
other in the profundity of a winding cellar-stair.His only impediment
arose from the snarling and vehement barking of a small cocking spaniel,
once his own property, but which, unlike to the faithful Argus, saw his
master return from his wanderings without any symptom of recognition.said Morton to himself, on being disowned by
his former favourite."I am so changed that no breathing creature that I
have known and loved will now acknowledge me!"At this moment he had reached the kitchen; and soon after, the tread of
Alison's high heels, and the pat of the crutch-handled cane which served
at once to prop and to guide her footsteps, were heard upon the
stairs,--an annunciation which continued for some time ere she fairly
reached the kitchen.Morton had, therefore, time to survey the slender preparations for
housekeeping which were now sufficient in the house of his ancestors.The
fire, though coals are plenty in that neighbourhood, was husbanded with
the closest attention to economy of fuel, and the small pipkin, in which
was preparing the dinner of the old woman and her maid-of-all-work, a
girl of twelve years old, intimated, by its thin and watery vapour, that
Ailie had not mended her cheer with her improved fortune.When she entered, the head, which nodded with self-importance; the
features, in which an irritable peevishness, acquired by habit and
indulgence, strove with a temper naturally affectionate and good-natured;
the coif; the apron; the blue-checked gown,--were all those of old Ailie;
but laced pinners, hastily put on to meet the stranger, with some other
trifling articles of decoration, marked the difference between Mrs.Wilson, life-rentrix of Milnwood, and the housekeeper of the late
proprietor."What were ye pleased to want wi' Mrs.Wilson,"
was her first address; for the five minutes time which she had gained for
the business of the toilet entitled her, she conceived, to assume the
full merit of her illustrious name, and shine forth on her guest in
unchastened splendour.Morton's sensations, confounded between the past
and present, fairly confused him so much that he would have had
difficulty in answering her, even if he had known well what to say.But
as he had not determined what character he was to adopt while concealing
that which was properly his own, he had an additional reason for
remaining silent.Wilson, in perplexity, and with some apprehension,
repeated her question."What were ye pleased to want wi' me, sir?"Pardon me, madam," answered Henry, "it was of one Silas Morton I spoke.""It was his father, then, ye kent o', the brother o' the late Milnwood?Ye canna mind him abroad, I wad think,--he was come hame afore ye were
born.I thought ye had brought me news of poor Maister Harry.""It was from my father I learned to know Colonel Morton," said Henry; "of
the son I know little or nothing,--rumour says he died abroad on his
passage to Holland.""That's ower like to be true," said the old woman with a sigh, "and mony
a tear it's cost my auld een.His uncle, poor gentleman, just sough'd awa
wi' it in his mouth.He had been gieing me preceeze directions anent the
bread and the wine and the brandy at his burial, and how often it was to
be handed round the company (for, dead or alive, he was a prudent,
frugal, painstaking man), and then he said, said he, 'Ailie,' (he aye
ca'd me Ailie; we were auld acquaintance), 'Ailie, take ye care and haud
the gear weel thegither; for the name of Morton of Milnwood's gane out
like the last sough of an auld sang.'And sae he fell out o' ae dwam into
another, and ne'er spak a word mair, unless it were something we cou'dna
mak out, about a dipped candle being gude eneugh to see to dee wi'.He
cou'd ne'er bide to see a moulded ane, and there was ane, by ill luck, on
the table."Wilson was thus detailing the last moments of the old miser,
Morton was pressingly engaged in diverting the assiduous curiosity of the
dog, which, recovered from his first surprise, and combining former
recollections, had, after much snuffing and examination, begun a course
of capering and jumping upon the stranger which threatened every instant
to betray him.At length, in the urgency of his impatience, Morton could
not forbear exclaiming, in a tone of hasty impatience, "Down, Elphin!"Ye ken our dog's name," said the old lady, struck with great and sudden
surprise,--"ye ken our dog's name, and it's no a common ane.And the
creature kens you too," she continued, in a more agitated and shriller
tone,--"God guide us!So saying, the poor old woman threw herself around Morton's neck, cling
to him, kissed him as if he had been actually her child, and wept for
joy.There was no parrying the discovery, if he could have had the heart
to attempt any further disguise.He returned the embrace with the most
grateful warmth, and answered,--

"I do indeed live, dear Ailie, to thank you for all your kindness, past
and present, and to rejoice that there is at least one friend to welcome
me to my native country."exclaimed Ailie, "ye'll hae mony friends,--ye 'll hae mony
friends; for ye will hae gear, hinny,--ye will hae gear.Heaven mak ye a
gude guide o't!she continued, pushing him back from her
with her trembling hand and shrivelled arm, and gazing in his face as if
to read, at more convenient distance, the ravages which sorrow rather
than time had made on his face,--"Eh, sirs!ye're sair altered, hinny;
your face is turned pale, and your een are sunken, and your bonny
red-and-white cheeks are turned a' dark and sun-burnt.mony's the comely face they destroy.--And when cam ye here, hinny?And what for did ye na
write to us?And how cam ye to pass yoursell for dead?And what for did
ye come creepin' to your ain house as if ye had been an unto body, to gie
poor auld Ailie sic a start?"It was some time ere Morton could overcome his own emotion so as to give
the kind old woman the information which we shall communicate to our
readers in the next chapter.Aumerle that was,
               But that is gone for being Richard's friend;
               And, madam, you must call him Rutland now.The scene of explanation was hastily removed from the little kitchen to
Mrs.Wilson's own matted room,--the very same which she had occupied as
housekeeper, and which she continued to retain."It was," she said,
"better secured against sifting winds than the hall, which she had found
dangerous to her rheumatisms, and it was more fitting for her use than
the late Milnwood's apartment, honest man, which gave her sad thoughts;"
and as for the great oak parlour, it was never opened but to be aired,
washed, and dusted, according to the invariable practice of the family,
unless upon their most solemn festivals.In the matted room, therefore,
they were settled, surrounded by pickle-pots and conserves of all kinds,
which the ci-devant housekeeper continued to compound, out of mere habit,
although neither she herself, nor any one else, ever partook of the
comfits which she so regularly prepared.Morton, adapting his narrative to the comprehension of his auditor,
informed her briefly of the wreck of the vessel and the loss of all
hands, excepting two or three common seamen who had early secured the
skiff, and were just putting off from the vessel when he leaped from the
deck into their boat, and unexpectedly, as well as contrary to their
inclination, made himself partner of their voyage and of their safety.Landed at Flushing, he was fortunate enough to meet with an old officer
who had been in service with his father.By his advice, he shunned going
immediately to the Hague, but forwarded his letters to the court of the
Stadtholder."Our prince," said the veteran, "must as yet keep terms with his
father-in-law and with your King Charles; and to approach him in the
character of a Scottish malecontent would render it imprudent for him to
distinguish you by his favour.Wait, therefore, his orders, without
forcing yourself on his notice; observe the strictest prudence and
retirement; assume for the present a different name; shun the company of
the British exiles; and, depend upon it, you will not repent your
prudence."The old friend of Silas Morton argued justly.After a considerable time
had elapsed, the Prince of Orange, in a progress through the United
States, came to the town where Morton, impatient at his situation and the
incognito which he was obliged to observe, still continued, nevertheless,
to be a resident.He had an hour of private interview assigned, in which
the prince expressed himself highly pleased with his intelligence, his
prudence, and the liberal view which he seemed to take of the factions of
his native country, their motives and their purposes."I would gladly," said William, "attach you to my own person; but that
cannot be without giving offence in England.But I will do as much for
you, as well out of respect for the sentiments you have expressed, as for
the recommendations you have brought me.Here is a commission in a Swiss
regiment at present in garrison in a distant province, where you will
meet few or none of your countrymen.Continue to be Captain Melville, and
let the name of Morton sleep till better days.""Thus began my fortune," continued Morton; "and my services have, on
various occasions, been distinguished by his Royal Highness, until the
moment that brought him to Britain as our political deliverer.His
commands must excuse my silence to my few friends in Scotland; and I
wonder not at the report of my death, considering the wreck of the
vessel, and that I found no occasion to use the letters of exchange with
which I was furnished by the liberality of some of them,--a circumstance
which must have confirmed the belief that I had perished.""But, dear hinny," asked Mrs.Wilson, "did ye find nae Scotch body at the
Prince of Oranger's court that kend ye?I wad hae thought Morton o'
Milnwood was kend a' through the country.""I was purposely engaged in distant service," said Morton, "until a
period when few, without as deep and kind a motive of interest as yours,
Ailie, would have known the stripling Morton in Major-General Melville.""Malville was your mother's name," said Mrs.Wilson; "but Morton sounds
far bonnier in my auld lugs.And when ye tak up the lairdship, ye maun
tak the auld name and designation again.""I am like to be in no haste to do either the one or the other, Ailie,
for I have some reasons for the present to conceal my being alive from
every one but you; and as for the lairdship of Milnwood, it is in as good
hands.""As gude hands, hinny!"re-echoed Ailie; "I'm hopefu' ye are no meaning
mine?The rents and the lands are but a sair fash to me.And I'm ower
failed to tak a helpmate, though Wylie Mactrickit the writer was very
pressing, and spak very civilly; but I'm ower auld a cat to draw that
strae before me.He canna whilliwhaw me as he's dune mony a ane.And then
I thought aye ye wad come back, and I wad get my pickle meal and my soup
milk, and keep a' things right about ye as I used to do in your puir
uncle's time, and it wad be just pleasure eneugh for me to see ye thrive
and guide the gear canny.Ye'll hae learned that in Holland, I'se
warrant, for they're thrifty folk there, as I hear tell.--But ye'll be
for keeping rather a mair house than puir auld Milnwood that's gave; and,
indeed, I would approve o' your eating butchermeat maybe as aften as
three times a-week,--it keeps the wind out o' the stamack.""We will talk of all this another time," said Morton, surprised at the
generosity upon a large scale which mingled in Ailie's thoughts and
actions with habitual and sordid parsimony, and at the odd contrast
between her love of saving and indifference to self-acquisition."You
must know," he continued, "that I am in this country only for a few days
on some special business of importance to the Government, and therefore,
Ailie, not a word of having seen me.At some other time I will acquaint
you fully with my motives and intentions.""E'en be it sae, my jo," replied Ailie, "I can keep a secret like my
neighbours; and weel auld Milnwood kend it, honest man, for he tauld me
where he keepit his gear, and that's what maist folk like to hae as
private as possibly may be.--But come awa wi' me, hinny, till I show ye
the oak-parlour how grandly it's keepit, just as if ye had been expected
haine every day,--I loot naebody sort it but my ain hands.It was a kind
o' divertisement to me, though whiles the tear wan into my ee, and I said
to mysell, What needs I fash wi' grates and carpets and cushions and the
muckle brass candlesticks ony mair?for they'll ne'er come hame that
aught it rightfully."With these words she hauled him away to this sanctum sanctorum, the
scrubbing and cleaning whereof was her daily employment, as its high
state of good order constituted the very pride of her heart.Morton, as
he followed her into the room, underwent a rebuke for not "dighting his
shune," which showed that Ailie had not relinquished her habits of
authority.On entering the oak-parlour he could not but recollect the
feelings of solemn awe with which, when a boy, he had been affected at
his occasional and rare admission to an apartment which he then supposed
had not its equal save in the halls of princes.It may be readily
supposed that the worked-worsted chairs, with their short ebony legs and
long upright backs, had lost much of their influence over his mind; that
the large brass andirons seemed diminished in splendour; that the green
worsted tapestry appeared no masterpiece of the Arras loom; and that the
room looked, on the whole, dark, gloomy, and disconsolate.Yet there were
two objects, "The counterfeit presentment of two brothers," which,
dissimilar as those described by Hamlet, affected his mind with a variety
of sensations.One full-length portrait represented his father in
complete armour, with a countenance indicating his masculine and
determined character; and the other set forth his uncle, in velvet and
brocade, looking as if he were ashamed of his own finery, though entirely
indebted for it to the liberality of the painter."It was an idle fancy," Ailie said, "to dress the honest auld man in thae
expensive fal-lalls that he ne'er wore in his life, instead o' his douce
Raploch grey, and his band wi' the narrow edging."In private, Morton could not help being much of her opinion; for anything
approaching to the dress of a gentleman sate as ill on the ungainly
person of his relative as an open or generous expression would have done
on his mean and money-making features.He now extricated himself from
Ailie to visit some of his haunts in the neighbouring wood, while her own
hands made an addition to the dinner she was preparing,--an incident no
otherwise remarkable than as it cost the life of a fowl, which, for any
event of less importance than the arrival of Henry Morton, might have
cackled on to a good old age ere Ailie could have been guilty of the
extravagance of killing and dressing it.The meal was seasoned by talk of
old times and by the plans which Ailie laid out for futurity, in which
she assigned her young master all the prudential habits of her old one,
and planned out the dexterity with which she was to exercise her duty as
governante.Morton let the old woman enjoy her day-dreams and
castle-building during moments of such pleasure, and deferred till some
fitter occasion the communication of his purpose again to return and
spend his life upon the Continent.His next care was to lay aside his military dress, which he considered
likely to render more difficult his researches after Burley.He exchanged
it--for a grey doublet and cloak, formerly his usual attire at Milnwood,
and which Mrs.Wilson produced from a chest of walnut-tree, wherein she
had laid them aside, without forgetting carefully to brush and air them
from time to time.Morton retained his sword and fire-arms, without which
few persons travelled in those unsettled times.When he appeared in his
new attire, Mrs.Wilson was first thankful "that they fitted him sae
decently, since, though he was nae fatter, yet he looked mair manly than
when he was taen frae Milnwood."Next she enlarged on the advantage of saving old clothes to be what she
called "beet-masters to the new," and was far advanced in the history of
a velvet cloak belonging to the late Milnwood, which had first been
converted to a velvet doublet, and then into a pair of breeches, and
appeared each time as good as new, when Morton interrupted her account of
its transmigration to bid her good-by.He gave, indeed, a sufficient shock to her feelings, by expressing the
necessity he was under of proceeding on his journey that evening.And whar wad ye
sleep but in your ain house, after ye hae been sae mony years frae hame?""I feel all the unkindness of it, Ailie, but it must be so; and that was
the reason that I attempted to conceal myself from you, as I suspected
you would not let me part from you so easily.""But whar are ye gaun, then?""Saw e'er mortal een
the like o' you, just to come ae moment, and flee awa like an arrow out
of a bow the neist?""I must go down," replied Morton, "to Niel Blane the Piper's Howff; he
can give me a bed, I suppose?"I'se warrant can he," replied Ailie, "and gar ye pay weel for 't
into the bargain.Laddie, I daresay ye hae lost your wits in thae foreign
parts, to gang and gie siller for a supper and a bed, and might hae baith
for naething, and thanks t' ye for accepting them.""I assure you, Ailie," said Morton, desirous to silence her
remonstrances, "that this is a business of great importance, in which I
may be a great gainer, and cannot possibly be a loser.""I dinna see how that can be, if ye begin by gieing maybe the feck o'
twal shillings Scots for your supper; but young folks are aye
venturesome, and think to get siller that way.My puir auld master took
a surer gate, and never parted wi' it when he had anes gotten 't."Persevering in his desperate resolution, Morton took leave of Ailie, and
mounted his horse to proceed to the little town, after exacting a solemn
promise that she would conceal his return until she again saw or heard
from him."I am not very extravagant," was his natural reflection, as he trotted
slowly towards the town; "but were Ailie and I to set up house together,
as she proposes, I think my profusion would break the good old creature's
heart before a week were out."Where's the jolly host
               You told me of?'T has been my custom ever
               To parley with mine host.Morton reached the borough town without meeting with any remarkable
adventure, and alighted at the little inn.It had occurred to him more
than once, while upon his journey, that his resumption of the dress which
he had worn while a youth, although favourable to his views in other
respects, might render it more difficult for him to remain incognito.But
a few years of campaigns and wandering had so changed his appearance that
he had great confidence that in the grown man, whose brows exhibited the
traces of resolution and considerate thought, none would recognise the
raw and bashful stripling who won the game of the popinjay.The only
chance was that here and there some Whig, whom he had led to battle,
might remember the Captain of the Milnwood Marksmen; but the risk, if
there was any, could not be guarded against.The Howff seemed full and frequented as if possessed of all its old
celebrity.The person and demeanour of Niel Blane, more fat and less
civil than of yore, intimated that he had increased as well in purse as
in corpulence; for in Scotland a landlord's complaisance for his guests
decreases in exact proportion to his rise in the world.His daughter had
acquired the air of a dexterous barmaid, undisturbed by the circumstances
of love and war, so apt to perplex her in the exercise of her vocation.Both showed Morton the degree of attention which could have been expected
by a stranger travelling without attendants, at a time when they were
particularly the badges of distinction.He took upon himself exactly the
character his appearance presented, went to the stable and saw his horse
accommodated, then returned to the house, and seating himself in the
public room (for to request one to himself would, in those days, have
been thought an overweening degree of conceit), he found himself in the
very apartment in which he had some years before celebrated his victory
at the game of the popinjay,--a jocular preferment which led to so many
serious consequences.He felt himself, as may well be supposed, a much changed man since that
festivity; and yet, to look around him, the groups assembled in the Howff
seemed not dissimilar to those which the same scene had formerly
presented.Two or three burghers husbanded their "dribbles o' brandy;"
two or three dragoons lounged over their muddy ale, and cursed the
inactive times that allowed them no better cheer.Their cornet did not,
indeed, play at backgammon with the curate in his cassock, but he drank
a little modicum of _aqua mirabilis_ with the grey-cloaked Presbyterian
minister.The scene was another, and yet the same, differing only in
persons, but corresponding in general character.Let the tide of the world wax or wane as it will, Morton thought as he
looked around him, enough will be found to fill the places which chance
renders vacant; and in the usual occupations and amusements of life,
human beings will succeed each other as leaves upon the same tree, with
the same individual difference and the same general resemblance.After pausing a few minutes, Morton, whose experience had taught him the
readiest mode of securing attention, ordered a pint of claret; and as the
smiling landlord appeared with the pewter measure foaming fresh from the
tap (for bottling wine was not then in fashion), he asked him to sit down
and take a share of the good cheer.This invitation was peculiarly
acceptable to Niel Blane, who, if he did not positively expect it from
every guest not provided with better company, yet received it from many,
and was not a whit abashed or surprised at the summons.He sat down,
along with his guest, in a secluded nook near the chimney; and while he
received encouragement to drink by far the greater share of the liquor
before them, he entered at length, as a part of his expected functions,
upon the news of the country,--the births, deaths, and marriages; the
change of property; the downfall of old families, and the rise of new.But politics, now the fertile source of eloquence, mine host did not care
to mingle in his theme; and it was only in answer to a question of Morton
that he replied, with an air of indifference, "Um!we aye hae sodgers
amang us, mair or less.There's a wheen German horse down at Glasgow
yonder; they ca' their commander Wittybody, or some sic name, though he's
as grave and grewsome an auld Dutchman as e'er I saw."said Morton,--"an old man, with grey hair and
short black moustaches; speaks seldom?""And smokes for ever," replied Niel Blane."I see your honour kens the
man.He may be a very gude man too, for aught I see,--that is,
considering he is a sodger and a Dutchman; but if he were ten generals,
and as mony Wittybodies, he has nae skill in the pipes; he gar'd me stop
in the middle of Torphichen's Rant,--the best piece o' music that ever
bag gae wind to.""But these fellows," said Morton, glancing his eye towards the soldiers
"that were in the apartment, are not of his corps?""Na, na, these are Scotch dragoons," said mine host,--"our ain auld
caterpillars; these were Claver'se's lads a while syne, and wad be again,
maybe, if he had the lang ten in his hand.""Is there not a report of his death?""Troth is there," said the landlord; "your honour is right,--there is sic
a fleeing rumour; but, in my puir opinion, it's lang or the deil die.I
wad hae the folks here look to themsells.If he makes an outbreak, he'll
be doun frae the Hielands or I could drink this glass,--and whare are
they then?A' thae hell-rakers o' dragoons wad be at his whistle in a
moment.Nae doubt they're Willie's men e'en now, as they were James's a
while syne; and reason good,--they fight for their pay; what else hae
they to fight for?They hae neither lands nor houses, I trow.There's ae
gude thing o' the change, or the Revolution, as they ca' it,--folks may
speak out afore thae birkies now, and nae fear o' being hauled awa to the
guard-house, or having the thumikins screwed on your finger-ends, just as
I wad drive the screw through a cork."There was a little pause, when Morton, feeling confident in the progress
he had made in mine host's familiarity, asked, though with the hesitation
proper to one who puts a question on the answer to which rests something
of importance, "Whether Blane knew a woman in that neighbourhood called
Elizabeth Maclure?""Whether I ken Bessie Maclure?"answered the landlord, with a landlord's
laugh,--"How can I but ken my ain wife's (haly be her rest!)--my ain
wife's first gudeman's sister, Bessie Maclure?An honest wife she is, but
sair she's been trysted wi' misfortunes,--the loss o' twa decent lads o'
sons, in the time o' the persecution, as they ca' it nowadays; and
doucely and decently she has borne her burden, blaming nane and
condemning nane.If there's an honest woman in the world, it's Bessie
Maclure.And to lose her twa sons, as I was saying, and to hae dragoons
clinked down on her for a month bypast,--for, be Whig or Tory uppermost,
they aye quarter thae loons on victuallers,--to lose, as I was saying--"

"This woman keeps an inn, then?""A public, in a puir way," replied Blane, looking round at his own
superior accommodations,--"a sour browst o' sma' ale that she sells to
folk that are over drouthy wi' travel to be nice; but naething to ca' a
stirring trade or a thriving changehouse.""Your honour will rest here a' the night?Ye'll hardly get accommodation
at Bessie's," said Niel, whose regard for his deceased wife's relative by
no means extended to sending company from his own house to hers."There is a friend," answered Morton, "whom I am to meet with there, and
I only called here to take a stirrup-cup and inquire the way.""Your honour had better," answerd the landlord, with the perseverance of
his calling, "send some ane to warn your friend to come on here.""I tell you, landlord," answered Morton, impatiently, "that will not
serve my purpose; I must go straight to this woman Maclure's house, and
I desire you to find me a guide.""Aweel, sir, ye'll choose for yoursell, to be sure," said Niel Blane,
somewhat disconcerted; "but deil a guide ye'll need if ye gae doun the
water for twa mile or sae, as gin ye were bound for Milnwoodhouse, and
then tak the first broken disjasked-looking road that makes for the
hills,--ye'll ken 't by a broken ash-tree that stands at the side o' a
burn just where the roads meet; and then travel out the path,--ye canna
miss Widow Maclure's public, for deil another house or hauld is on the
road for ten lang Scots miles, and that's worth twenty English.I am
sorry your honour would think o' gaun out o' my house the night.But my
wife's gude-sister is a decent woman, and it's no lost that a friend
gets."Morton accordingly paid his reckoning and departed.The sunset of the
summer day placed him at the ash-tree, where the path led up towards the
moors."Here," he said to himself, "my misfortunes commenced; for just here,
when Burley and I were about to separate on the first night we ever met,
he was alarmed by the intelligence that the passes were secured by
soldiers lying in wait for him.Beneath that very ash sate the old woman
who apprised him of his danger.How strange that my whole fortunes should
have become inseparably interwoven with that man's, without anything more
on my part than the discharge of an ordinary duty of humanity!Would to
Heaven it were possible I could find my humble quiet and tranquillity of
mind upon the spot where I lost them!"Thus arranging his reflections betwixt speech and thought, he turned his
horse's head up the path.Evening lowered around him as he advanced up the narrow dell which had
once been a wood, but was now a ravine divested of trees, unless where a
few, from their inaccessible situation on the edge of precipitous banks,
or clinging among rocks and huge stones, defied the invasion of men and
of cattle, like the scattered tribes of a conquered country, driven to
take refuge in the barren strength of its mountains.These too, wasted
and decayed, seemed rather to exist than to flourish, and only served to
indicate what the landscape had once been.But the stream brawled down
among them in all its freshness and vivacity, giving the life and
animation which a mountain rivulet alone can confer on the barest and
most savage scenes, and which the inhabitants of such a country miss when
gazing even upon the tranquil winding of a majestic stream through plains
of fertility, and beside palaces of splendour.The track of the road
followed the course of the brook, which was now visible, and now only to
be distinguished by its brawling heard among the stones or in the clefts
of the rock that occasionally interrupted its course."Murmurer that thou art," said Morton, in the enthusiasm of his reverie,
"why chafe with the rocks that stop thy course for a moment?There is a
sea to receive thee in its bosom; and there is an eternity for man when
his fretful and hasty course through the vale of time shall be ceased and
over.What thy petty fuming is to the deep and vast billows of a
shoreless ocean, are our cares, hopes, fears, joys, and sorrows to the
objects which must occupy us through the awful and boundless succession
of ages!"Thus moralizing, our traveller passed on till the dell opened, and the
banks, receding from the brook, left a little green vale, exhibiting a
croft, or small field, on which some corn was growing, and a cottage,
whose walls were not above five feet high, and whose thatched roof, green
with moisture, age, houseleek, and grass, had in some places suffered
damage from the encroachment of two cows, whose appetite this appearance
of verdure had diverted from their more legitimate pasture.An ill-spelt
and worse-written inscription intimated to the traveller that he might
here find refreshment for man and horse,--no unacceptable intimation,
rude as the hut appeared to be, considering the wild path he had trod in
approaching it, and the high and waste mountains which rose in desolate
dignity behind this humble asylum.It must indeed have been, thought Morton, in some such spot as this that
Burley was likely to find a congenial confident.As he approached, he observed the good dame of the house herself, seated
by the door; she had hitherto been concealed from him by a huge
alder-bush."Good evening, Mother," said the traveller."Your name is Mistress
Maclure?""Elizabeth Maclure, sir, a poor widow," was the reply."Can you lodge a stranger for a night?""I can, sir, if he will be pleased with the widow's cake and the widow's
cruse.""I have been a soldier, good dame," answered Morton, "and nothing can
come amiss to me in the way of entertainment."said the old woman, with a sigh,--"God send ye a better
trade!""It is believed to be an honourable profession, my good dame; I hope you
do not think the worse of me for having belonged to it?""I judge no one, sir," replied the woman, "and your voice sounds like
that of a civil gentleman; but I hae witnessed sae muckle ill wi'
sodgering in this puir land that I am e'en content that I can see nae
mair o't wi' these sightless organs."As she spoke thus, Morton observed that she was blind."Shall I not be troublesome to you, my good dame?"said he,
compassionately; "your infirmity seems ill calculated for your
profession.""Na, sir," answered the old woman, "I can gang about the house readily
eneugh; and I hae a bit lassie to help me, and the dragoon lads will look
after your horse when they come hame frae their patrol, for a sma'
matter; they are civiller now than lang syne.""Peggy, my bonny bird," continued the hostess, addressing a little girl
of twelve years old, who had by this time appeared, "tak the gentleman's
horse to the stable, and slack his girths, and tak aff the bridle, and
shake down a lock o' hay before him, till the dragoons come back.--Come
this way, sir," she continued; "ye'll find my house clean, though it's a
puir ane."Morton followed her into the cottage accordingly.Then out and spake the auld mother,
               And fast her tears did fa
               "Ye wadna be warn'd, my son Johnie,
               Frae the hunting to bide awa!"When he entered the cottage, Morton perceived that the old hostess had
spoken truth.The inside of the hut belied its outward appearance, and
was neat, and even comfortable, especially the inner apartment, in which
the hostess informed her guest that he was to sup and sleep.Refreshments
were placed before him such as the little inn afforded; and though he had
small occasion for them, he accepted the offer, as the means of
maintaining some discourse with the landlady.Notwithstanding her
blindness, she was assiduous in her attendance, and seemed, by a sort of
instinct, to find her way to what she wanted."Have you no one but this pretty little girl to assist you in waiting on
your guests?""None, sir," replied his old hostess; "I dwell alone, like the widow of
Zarephath.Few guests come to this puir place, and I haena custom eneugh
to hire servants.I had anes twa fine sons that lookit after a' thing.--But God gives and takes away,--His name be praised!"she continued,
turning her clouded eyes towards Heaven.--"I was anes better off, that
is, waridly speaking, even since I lost them; but that was before this
last change."said Morton; "and yet you are a Presbyterian, my good mother?""I am, sir; praised be the light that showed me the right way," replied
the landlady."Then I should have thought," continued the guest, "the Revolution would
have brought you nothing but good.""If," said the old woman, "it has brought the land gude, and freedom of
worship to tender consciences, it's little matter what it has brought to
a puir blind worm like me.""Still," replied Morton, "I cannot see how it could possibly injure you.""It's a lang story, sir," answered his hostess, with a sigh."But ae
night, sax weeks or thereby afore Bothwell Brigg, a young gentleman
stopped at this puir cottage, stiff and bloody with wounds, pale and dune
out wi' riding, and his horse sae weary he couldna drag ae foot after the
other, and his foes were close ahint him, and he was ane o' our enemies.You that's a sodger will think me but a silly auld
wife; but I fed him, and relieved him, and keepit him hidden till the
pursuit was ower.""And who," said Morton, "dares disapprove of your having done so?""I kenna," answered the blind woman; "I gat ill-will about it amang some
o' our ain folk.They said I should hae been to him what Jael was to
Sisera.But weel I wot I had nae divine command to shed blood, and to
save it was baith like a woman and a Christian.And then they said I
wanted natural affection, to relieve ane that belanged to the band that
murdered my twa sons.""Ay, sir; though maybe ye'll gie their deaths another name.The tane fell
wi' sword in hand, fighting for a broken national Covenant; the
tother,--oh, they took him and shot him dead on the green before his
mother's face!My auld een dazzled when the shots were looten off, and,
to my thought, they waxed weaker and weaker ever since that weary day;
and sorrow, and heart-break, and tears that would not be dried, might
help on the disorder.betraying Lord Evandale's young blood
to his enemies' sword wad ne'er hae brought my Ninian and Johnie alive
again.""Was it Lord Evandale whose
life you saved?""In troth, even his," she replied."And kind he was to me after, and gae
me a cow and calf, malt, meal, and siller, and nane durst steer me when
he was in power.But we live on an outside bit of Tillietudlem land, and
the estate was sair plea'd between Leddy Margaret Bellenden and the
present laird, Basil Olifant, and Lord Evandale backed the auld leddy for
love o' her daughter Miss Edith, as the country said, ane o' the best and
bonniest lassies in Scotland.But they behuved to gie way, and Basil gat
the Castle and land, and on the back o' that came the Revolution, and wha
to turn coat faster than the laird?for he said he had been a true Whig
a' the time, and turned <DW7> only for fashion's sake.And then he got
favour, and Lord Evandale's head was under water; for he was ower proud
and manfu' to bend to every blast o' wind, though mony a ane may ken as
weel as me that be his ain principles as they might, he was nae ill
friend to our folk when he could protect us, and far kinder than Basil
Olifant, that aye keepit the cobble head doun the stream.But he was set
by and ill looked on, and his word ne'er asked; and then Basil, wha's a
revengefu' man, set himsell to vex him in a' shapes, and especially by
oppressing and despoiling the auld blind widow, Bessie Maclure, that
saved Lord Evandale's life, and that he was sae kind to.But he's mistaen
if that's his end; for it will be lang or Lord Evandale hears a word frae
me about the selling my kye for rent or e'er it was due, or the putting
the dragoons on me when the country's quiet, or onything else that will
vex him,--I can bear my ain burden patiently, and warld's loss is the
least part o't."Astonished and interested at this picture of patient, grateful, and
high-minded resignation, Morton could not help bestowing an execration
upon the poor-spirited rascal who had taken such a dastardly course of
vengeance."Dinna curse him, sir," said the old woman; "I have heard a good man say
that a curse was like a stone flung up to the heavens, and maist like to
return on the head that sent it.But if ye ken Lord Evandale, bid him
look to himsell, for I hear strange words pass atween the sodgers that
are lying here, and his name is often mentioned; and the tane o' them has
been twice up at Tillietudlem.He's a kind of favourite wi' the laird,
though he was in former times ane o' the maist cruel oppressors ever rade
through a country (out-taken Sergeant Bothwell),--they ca' him Inglis.""I have the deepest interest in Lord Evandale's safety," said Morton,
"and you may depend on my finding some mode to apprise him of these
suspicious circumstances.And, in return, my good friend, will you
indulge me with another question?Do you know anything of Quintin Mackell
of Irongray?"echoed the blind woman, in a tone of great surprise and
alarm."Quintin Mackell of Irongray," repeated Morton."Is there anything so
alarming in the sound of that name?""Na, na," answered the woman, with hesitation; "but to hear him asked
after by a stranger and a sodger,--Gude protect us, what mischief is
to come next!""None by my means, I assure you," said Morton; "the subject of my inquiry
has nothing to fear from me if, as I suppose, this Quintin Mackell is the
same with John Bal-----.""Do not mention his name," said the widow, pressing his lips with her
fingers."I see you have his secret and his pass-word, and I'll be free
wi' you.But, for God's sake, speak lound and low.In the name of Heaven,
I trust ye seek him not to his hurt!"I said truly; but one he has nothing to fear from.I commanded a party
at Bothwell Bridge.""And verily there is something in your voice I
can trust.Ye speak prompt and readily, and like an honest man.""I trust I am so," said Morton."But nae displeasure to you, sir, in thae waefu' times," continued Mrs.Maclure, "the hand of brother is against brother, and he fears as mickle
almaist frae this Government as e'er he did frae the auld persecutors."said Morton, in a tone of inquiry; "I was not aware of that.But
I am only just now returned from abroad.""I'll tell ye," said the blind woman, first assuming an attitude of
listening that showed how effectually her powers of collecting
intelligence had been transferred from the eye to the ear; for, instead
of casting a glance of circumspection around, she stooped her face, and
turned her head slowly around, in such a manner as to insure that there
was not the slightest sound stirring in the neighbourhood, and then
continued,--"I'll tell ye.Ye ken how he has laboured to raise up again
the Covenant, burned, broken, and buried in the hard hearts and selfish
devices of this stubborn people.Now, when he went to Holland, far from
the countenance and thanks of the great, and the comfortable fellowship
of the godly, both whilk he was in right to expect, the Prince of Orange
wad show him no favour, and the ministers no godly communion.This was
hard to bide for ane that had suffered and done mickle,--ower mickle, it
may be; but why suld I be a judge?He came back to me and to the auld
place o' refuge that had often received him in his distresses, mair
especially before the great day of victory at Drumclog, for I sail ne'er
forget how he was bending hither of a' nights in the year on that e'ening
after the play when young Milnwood wan the popinjay; but I warned him off
for that time."exclaimed Morton, "it was you that sat in your red cloak by the
high-road, and told him there was a lion in the path?"said the old woman, breaking off her
narrative in astonishment."But be wha ye may," she continued, resuming
it with tranquillity, "ye can ken naething waur o' me than that I hae
been willing to save the life o' friend and foe.""I know no ill of you, Mrs.Maclure, and I mean no ill by you; I only
wished to show you that I know so much of this person's affairs that I
might be safely intrusted with the rest.Proceed, if you please, in your
narrative.""There is a strange command in your voice," said the blind woman, "though
its tones are sweet.The Stewarts hae been
dethroned, and William and Mary reign in their stead; but nae mair word
of the Covenant than if it were a dead letter.They hae taen the indulged
clergy, and an Erastian General Assembly of the ante pure and triumphant
Kirk of Scotland, even into their very arms and bosoms.Our faithfu'
champions o' the testimony agree e'en waur wi' this than wi' the open
tyranny and apostasy of the persecuting times, for souls are hardened and
deadened, and the mouths of fasting multitudes are crammed wi' fizenless
bran instead of the sweet word in season; and mony an hungry, starving
creature, when he sits down on a Sunday forenoon to get something that
might warm him to the great work, has a dry clatter o' morality driven
about his lugs, and--"

"In short," said Morton, desirous to stop a discussion which the good old
woman, as enthusiastically attached to her religious profession as to the
duties of humanity, might probably have indulged longer,--"In short, you
are not disposed to acquiesce in this new government, and Burley is of
the same opinion?""Many of our brethren, sir, are of belief we fought for the Covenant, and
fasted and prayed and suffered for that grand national league, and now we
are like neither to see nor hear tell of that which we suffered and
fought and fasted and prayed for.And anes it was thought something might
be made by bringing back the auld family on a new bargain and a new
bottom, as, after a', when King James went awa, I understand the great
quarrel of the English against him was in behalf of seven unhallowed
prelates; and sae, though ae part of our people were free to join wi' the
present model, and levied an armed regiment under the Yerl of Angus, yet
our honest friend, and others that stude up for purity of doctrine and
freedom of conscience, were determined to hear the breath o' the
Jacobites before they took part again them, fearing to fa' to the ground
like a wall built with unslaked mortar, or from sitting between twa
stools.""They chose an odd quarter," said Morton, "from which to expect freedom
of conscience and purity of doctrine."said the landlady, "the natural day-spring rises in the
east, but the spiritual dayspring may rise in the north, for what we
blinded mortals ken.""And Burley went to the north to seek it?""Truly ay, sir; and he saw Claver'se himsell, that they ca' Dundee now."exclaimed Morton, in amazement; "I would have sworn that meeting
would have been the last of one of their lives.""Na, na, sir; in troubled times, as I understand," said Mrs.Maclure,
"there's sudden changes,--Montgomery and Ferguson and mony ane mair that
were King James's greatest faes are on his side now.Claver'se spake our
friend fair, and sent him to consult with Lord Evandale.But then there
was a break-off, for Lord Evandale wadna look at, hear, or speak wi' him;
and now he's anes wud and aye waur, and roars for revenge again Lord
Evandale, and will hear nought of onything but burn and slay.And oh,
thae starts o' passion!they unsettle his mind, and gie the Enemy sair
advantages."Are ye acquainted familiarly wi' John Balfour o' Burley, and
dinna ken that he has had sair and frequent combats to sustain against
the Evil One?Did ye ever see him alone but the Bible was in his hand,
and the drawn sword on his knee?Did ye never sleep in the same room wi'
him, and hear him strive in his dreams with the delusions of Satan?Oh,
ye ken little o' him if ye have seen him only in fair daylight; for nae
man can put the face upon his doleful visits and strifes that he can do.I hae seen him, after sic a strife of agony, tremble that an infant might
hae held him, while the hair on his brow was drapping as fast as ever my
puir thatched roof did in a heavy rain."As she spoke, Morton began to
recollect the appearance of Burley during his sleep in the hay-loft at
Milnwood, the report of Cuddie that his senses had become impaired, and
some whispers current among the Cameronians, who boasted frequently of
Burley's soul-exercises and his strifes with the foul fiend,--which
several circumstances led him to conclude that this man himself was a
victim to those delusions, though his mind, naturally acute and forcible,
not only disguised his superstition from those in whose opinion it might
have discredited his judgment, but by exerting such a force as is said to
be proper to those afflicted with epilepsy, could postpone the fits which
it occasioned until he was either freed from superintendence, or
surrounded by such as held him more highly on account of these
visitations.It was natural to suppose, and could easily be inferred from
the narrative of Mrs.Maclure, that disappointed ambition, wrecked hopes,
and the downfall of the party which he had served with such desperate
fidelity, were likely to aggravate enthusiasm into temporary insanity.It
was, indeed, no uncommon circumstance in those singular times that men
like Sir Harry Vane, Harrison, Overton, and others, themselves slaves to
the wildest and most enthusiastic dreams, could, when mingling with the
world, conduct themselves not only with good sense in difficulties, and
courage in dangers, but with the most acute sagacity and determined
valour.Maclure's information confirmed
Morton in these impressions."In the grey of the morning," she said, "my little Peggy sail show ye the
gate to him before the sodgers are up.But ye maun let his hour of
danger, as he ca's it, be ower, afore ye venture on him in his place of
refuge.Peggy will tell ye when to venture in.She kens his ways weel,
for whiles she carries him some little helps that he canna do
without to sustain life.""And in what retreat, then," said Morton, "has this unfortunate person
found refuge?""An awsome place," answered the blind woman, "as ever living creature
took refuge in; they ca it the Black Linn of Linklater.It's a doleful
place, but he loves it abune a' others, because he has sae often been in
safe hiding there; and it's my belief he prefers it to a tapestried
chamber and a down bed.I hae seen it mysell mony a day
syne.I was a daft hempie lassie then, and little thought what was to
come o't.--Wad ye choose ony thing, sir, ere ye betake yoursell to your
rest, for ye maun stir wi' the first dawn o' the grey light?""Nothing more, my good mother," said Morton; and they parted for the
evening.Morton recommended himself to Heaven, threw himself on the bed, heard,
between sleeping and waking, the trampling of the dragoon horses at the
riders' return from their patrol, and then slept soundly after such
painful agitation.The darksome cave they enter, where they found
               The accursed man low sitting on the ground,
               Musing full sadly in his sullen mind.As the morning began to appear on the mountains, a gentle knock was heard
at the door of the humble apartment in which Morton slept, and a girlish
treble voice asked him, from without, "If he wad please gang to the Linn
or the folk raise?"He arose upon the invitation, and, dressing himself hastily, went forth
and joined his little guide.The mountain maid tript lightly before him,
through the grey haze, over hill and moor.It was a wild and varied walk,
unmarked by any regular or distinguishable track, and keeping, upon the
whole, the direction of the ascent of the brook, though without tracing
its windings.The landscape, as they advanced, became waster and more
wild, until nothing but heath and rock encumbered the side of the valley."Nearly a mile off," answered
the girl."And do you often go this wild journey, my little maid?""When grannie sends me wi' milk and meal to the Linn," answered the
child."And are you not afraid to travel so wild a road alone?""Hout na, sir," replied the guide; "nae living creature wad touch sic a
bit thing as I am, and grannie says we need never fear onything else when
we are doing a gude turn."said Morton to himself, and
followed her steps in silence.They soon came to a decayed thicket, where brambles and thorns supplied
the room of the oak and birches of which it had once consisted.Here the
guide turned short off the open heath, and, by a sheep-track, conducted
Morton to the brook.A hoarse and sullen roar had in part prepared him
for the scene which presented itself, yet it was not to be viewed without
surprise and even terror.When he emerged from the devious path which
conducted him through the thicket, he found himself placed on a ledge of
flat rock projecting over one side of a chasm not less than a hundred
feet deep, where the dark mountain-stream made a decided and rapid shoot
over the precipice, and was swallowed up by a deep, black, yawning gulf.The eye in vain strove to see the bottom of the fall; it could catch but
one sheet of foaming uproar and sheer descent, until the view was
obstructed by the proecting crags which enclosed the bottom of the
waterfall, and hid from sight the dark pool which received its tortured
waters; far beneath, at the distance of perhaps a quarter of a mile, the
eye caught the winding of the stream as it emerged into a more open
course.But, for that distance, they were lost to sight as much as if a
cavern had been arched over them; and indeed the steep and projecting
ledges of rock through which they wound their way in darkness were very
nearly closing and over-roofing their course.While Morton gazed at this scene of tumult, which seemed, by the
surrounding thickets and the clefts into which the waters descended, to
seek to hide itself from every eye, his little attendant as she stood
beside him on the platform of rock which commanded the best view of the
fall, pulled him by the sleeve, and said, in a tone which he could not
hear without stooping his ear near the speaker, "Hear till him!Morton listened more attentively; and out of the very abyss into which
the brook fell, and amidst the turnultuary sounds of the cataract,
thought he could distinguish shouts, screams, and even articulate words,
as if the tortured demon of the stream had been mingling his complaints
with the roar of his broken waters."This is the way," said the little girl; "follow me, gin ye please, sir,
but tak tent to your feet;" and, with the daring agility which custom had
rendered easy, she vanished from the platform on which she stood, and, by
notches and slight projections in the rock, scrambled down its face into
the chasm which it overhung.Steady, bold, and active, Morton hesitated
not to follow her; but the necessary attention to secure his hold and
footing in a descent where both foot and hand were needful for security,
prevented him from looking around him, till, having descended nigh twenty
feet, and being sixty or seventy above the pool which received the fall,
his guide made a pause, and he again found himself by her side in a
situation that appeared equally romantic and precarious.They were nearly
opposite to the waterfall, and in point of level situated at about
one-quarter's depth from the point of the cliff over which it thundered,
and three-fourths of the height above the dark, deep, and restless pool
which received its fall.Both these tremendous points--the first shoot,
namely, of the yet unbroken stream, and the deep and sombre abyss into
which it was emptied--were full before him, as well as the whole
continuous stream of billowy froth, which, dashing from the one, was
eddying and boiling in the other.They were so near this grand phenomenon
that they were covered with its spray, and well-nigh deafened by the
incessant roar.But crossing in the very front of the fall, and at scarce
three yards distance from the cataract, an old oak-tree, flung across the
chasm in a manner that seemed accidental, formed a bridge of fearfully
narrow dimensions and uncertain footing.The upper end of the tree rested
on the platform on which they stood; the lower or uprooted extremity
extended behind a projection on the opposite side, and was secured,
Morton's eye could not discover where.From behind the same projection
glimmered a strong red light, which, glancing in the waves of the falling
water, and tinging them partially with crimson, had a strange
preternatural and sinister effect when contrasted with the beams of the
rising sun, which glanced on the first broken waves of the fall, though
even its meridian splendour could not gain the third of its full depth.When he had looked around him for a moment, the girl again pulled his
sleeve, and, pointing to the oak and the projecting point beyond it (for
hearing speech was now out of the question), indicated that there lay his
farther passage.Morton gazed at her with surprise; for although he well knew that the
persecuted Presbyterians had in the preceding reigns sought refuge among
dells and thickets, caves and cataracts, in spots the most extraordinary
and secluded; although he had heard of the champions of the Covenant, who
had long abidden beside Dobs-lien on the wild heights of Polmoodie, and
others who had been concealed in the yet more terrific cavern called
Creehope-linn, in the parish of Closeburn,--yet his imagination had never
exactly figured out the horrors of such a residence, and he was surprised
how the strange and romantic scene which he now saw had remained
concealed from him, while a curious investigator of such natural
phenomena.But he readily conceived that, lying in a remote and wild
district, and being destined as a place of concealment to the persecuted
preachers and professors of nonconformity, the secret of its existence
was carefully preserved by the few shepherds to whom it might be known.As, breaking from these meditations, he began to consider how he should
traverse the doubtful and terrific bridge, which, skirted by the cascade,
and rendered wet and slippery by its constant drizzle, traversed the
chasm above sixty feet from the bottom of the fall, his guide, as if to
give him courage, tript over and back without the least hesitation.Envying for a moment the little bare feet which caught a safer hold of
the rugged side of the oak than he could pretend to with his heavy boots,
Morton nevertheless resolved to attempt the passage, and, fixing his eye
firm on a stationary object on the other side, without allowing his head
to become giddy, or his attention to be distracted by the flash, the
foam, and the roar of the waters around him, he strode steadily and
safely along the uncertain bridge, and reached the mouth of a small
cavern on the farther side of the torrent.Here he paused; for a light,
proceeding from a fire of red-hot charcoal, permitted him to see the
interior of the cave, and enabled him to contemplate the appearance of
its inhabitant, by whom he himself could not be so readily distinguished,
being concealed by the shadow of the rock.What he observed would by no
means have encouraged a less determined man to proceed with the task
which he had undertaken.Burley, only altered from what he had been formerly by the addition of a
grisly beard, stood in the midst of the cave, with his clasped Bible in
one hand, and his drawn sword in the other.His figure, dimly ruddied by
the light of the red charcoal, seemed that of a fiend in the lurid
atmosphere of Pandemonium, and his gestures and words, as far as they
could be heard, seemed equally violent and irregular.All alone, and in a
place of almost unapproachable seclusion, his demeanour was that of
a man who strives for life and death with a mortal enemy.he exclaimed, accompanying each word with a thrust,
urged with his whole force against the impassible and empty air, "Did I
not tell thee so?--I have resisted, and thou fleest from me!--Coward as
thou art, come in all thy terrors; come with mine own evil deeds, which
render thee most terrible of all,--there is enough betwixt the boards of
this book to rescue me!--What mutterest thou of grey hairs?It was well
done to slay him,--the more ripe the corn, the readier for the sickle.--
Art gone?Art gone?--I have ever known thee but a coward--ha!With these wild exclamations he sunk the point of his sword, and remained
standing still in the same posture, like a maniac whose fit is over."The dangerous time is by now," said the little girl who had followed;
"it seldom lasts beyond the time that the sun's ower the hill; ye may
gang in and speak wi' him now.I'll wait for you at the other side of the
linn; he canna bide to see twa folk at anes."Slowly and cautiously, and keeping constantly upon his guard, Morton
presented himself to the view of his old associate in command.comest thou again when thine hour is over?"was his first
exclamation; and flourishing his sword aloft, his countenance assumed an
expression in which ghastly terror seemed mingled with the rage of a
demoniac.Balfour," said Morton, in a steady and composed tone,
"to renew an acquaintance which has been broken off since the fight of
Bothwell Bridge."As soon as Burley became aware that Morton was before him in person,--an
idea which he caught with marvellous celerity,--he at once exerted that
mastership over his heated and enthusiastic imagination, the power of
enforcing which was a most striking part of his extraordinary character.He sunk his sword-point at once, and as he stole it composedly into the
scabbard, he muttered something of the damp and cold which sent an old
soldier to his fencing exercise, to prevent his blood from chilling.This
done, he proceeded in the cold, determined manner which was peculiar to
his ordinary discourse:--

"Thou hast tarried long, Henry Morton, and hast not come to the vintage
before the twelfth hour has struck.Art thou yet willing to take the
right hand of fellowship, and be one with those who look not to thrones
or dynasties, but to the rule of Scripture, for their directions?"[Illustration: Morton and Black Linn--272]


"I am surprised," said Morton, evading the direct answer to his question,
"that you should have known me after so many years.""The features of those who ought to act with me are engraved on my
heart," answered Burley; "and few but Silas Morton's son durst have
followed me into this my castle of retreat.Seest thou that drawbridge of
Nature's own construction?"he added, pointing to the prostrate
oak-tree,--"one spurn of my foot, and it is overwhelmed in the abyss
below, bidding foeman on the farther side stand at defiance, and leaving
enemies on this at the mercy of one who never yet met his equal in single
fight.""Of such defences," said Morton, "I should have thought you would now
have had little need.""What little need, when incarnate
fiends are combined against me on earth, and Sathan himself--But it
matters not," added he, checking himself."Enough that I like my place
of refuge, my cave of Adullam, and would not change its rude ribs of
limestone rock for the fair chambers of the castle of the earls of
Torwood, with their broad bounds and barony.Thou, unless the foolish
fever-fit be over, mayst think differently.""It was of those very possessions I came to speak," said Morton; "and I
doubt not to find Mr.Balfour the same rational and reflecting person
which I knew him to be in times when zeal disunited brethren.""In a word, then," said Morton, "you have exercised, by means at which I
can guess, a secret, but most prejudicial, influence over the fortunes of
Lady Margaret Bellenden and her granddaughter, and in favour of that
base, oppressive apostate, Basil Olifant, whom the law, deceived by thy
operations, has placed in possession of their lawful property.""I do say so," replied Morton; "and face to face you will not deny what
you have vouched by your handwriting.""And suppose I deny it not," said Balfour; "and suppose that
thy--eloquence were found equal to persuade me to retrace the steps I
have taken on matured resolve,--what will be thy meed?Dost thou still
hope to possess the fair-haired girl, with her wide and rich
inheritance?""I have no such hope," answered Morton, calmly."And for whom, then, hast thou ventured to do this great thing,--to seek
to rend the prey from the valiant, to bring forth food from the den of
the lion, and to extract sweetness from the maw of the devourer?For
whose sake hast thou undertaken to read this riddle, more hard than
Samson's?""For Lord Evandale's and that of his bride," replied Morton, firmly.Balfour, and believe there are some who are
willing to sacrifice their happiness to that of others.""Then, as my soul liveth," replied Balfour, "thou art, to wear beard and
back a horse and draw a sword, the tamest and most gall-less puppet that
ever sustained injury unavenged.thou wouldst help that accursed
Evandale to the arms of the woman that thou lovest; thou wouldst endow
them with wealth and with heritages, and thou think'st that there lives
another man, offended even more deeply than thou, yet equally
cold-livered and mean-spirited, crawling upon the face of the earth,
and hast dared to suppose that one other to be John Balfour?""For my own feelings," said Morton, composedly, "I am answerable to none
but Heaven; to you, Mr.Balfour, I should suppose it of little
consequence whether Basil Olifant or Lord Evandale possess these
estates.""Thou art deceived," said Burley; "both are indeed in outer darkness,
and strangers to the light, as he whose eyes have never been opened to
the day.But this Basil Olifant is a Nabal, a Demas, a base churl whose
wealth and power are at the disposal of him who can threaten to deprive
him of them.He became a professor because he was deprived of these lands
of Tillietudlem; he turned a <DW7> to obtain possession of them; he
called himself an Erastian, that he might not again lose them; and he
will become what I list while I have in my power the document that may
deprive him of them.These lands are a bit between his jaws and a hook in
his nostrils, and the rein and the line are in my hands to guide them as
I think meet; and his they shall therefore be, unless I had assurance of
bestowing them on a sure and sincere friend.But Lord Evandale is a
malignant, of heart like flint, and brow like adamant; the goods of the
world fall on him like leaves on the frost-bound earth, and unmoved he
will see them whirled off by the first wind.The heathen virtues of such
as he are more dangerous to us than the sordid cupidity of those who,
governed by their interest, must follow where it leads, and who,
therefore, themselves the slaves of avarice, may be compelled to work
in the vineyard, were it but to earn the wages of sin.""This might have been all well some years since," replied Morton, "and I
could understand your argument, although I could never acquiesce in its
justice.But at this crisis it seems useless to you to persevere in
keeping up an influence which can no longer be directed to an useful
purpose.The land has peace, liberty, and freedom of conscience,--and
what would you more?"exclaimed Burley, again unsheathing his sword, with a vivacity
which nearly made Morton start."Look at the notches upon that weapon
they are three in number, are they not?""It seems so," answered Morton; "but what of that?""The fragment of steel that parted from this first gap rested on the
skull of the perjured traitor who first introduced Episcopacy into
Scotland; this second notch was made in the rib-bone of an impious
villain, the boldest and best soldier that upheld the prelatic cause at
Drumclog; this third was broken on the steel head-piece of the captain
who defended the Chapel of Holyrood when the people rose at the
Revolution.I cleft him to the teeth, through steel and bone.It has done
great deeds, this little weapon, and each of these blows was a
deliverance to the Church.This sword," he said, again sheathing it,
"has yet more to do,--to weed out this base and pestilential heresy of
Erastianism; to vindicate the true liberty of the Kirk in her purity;
to restore the Covenant in its glory,--then let it moulder and rust
beside the bones of its master.""You have neither men nor means, Mr.Balfour, to disturb the Government
as now settled," argued Morton; "the people are in general satisfied,
excepting only the gentlemen of the Jacobite interest; and surely you
would not join with those who would only use you for their own purposes?""It is they," answered Burley, "that should serve ours.I went to the
camp of the malignant Claver'se, as the future King of Israel sought the
land of the Philistines; I arranged with him a rising; and but for the
villain Evandale, the Erastians ere now had been driven from the West.--
I could slay him," he added, with a vindictive scowl, "were he grasping
the horns of the altar!"He then proceeded in a calmer tone: "If thou,
son of mine ancient comrade, were suitor for thyself to this Edith
Bellenden, and wert willing to put thy hand to the great work with zeal
equal to thy courage, think not I would prefer the friendship of Basil
Olifant to thine; thou shouldst then have the means that this document
[he produced a parchment] affords to place her in possession of the lands
of her fathers.This have I longed to say to thee ever since I saw thee
fight the good fight so strongly at the fatal Bridge.The maiden loved
thee, and thou her."Morton replied firmly, "I will not dissemble with you, Mr.Balfour, even
to gain a good end.I came in hopes to persuade you to do a deed of
justice to others, not to gain any selfish end of my own.I have failed;
I grieve for your sake more than for the loss which others will sustain
by your injustice.""Would you be really, as you are desirous to be
thought, a man of honour and conscience, you would, regardless of all
other considerations, restore that parchment to Lord Evandale, to be used
for the advantage of the lawful heir."said Balfour; and, casting the deed into the
heap of red charcoal beside him, pressed it down with the heel of his
boot.While it smoked, shrivelled, and crackled in the flames, Morton sprung
forward to snatch it, and Burley catching hold of him, a struggle ensued.Both were strong men; but although Morton was much the more active and
younger of the two, yet Balfour was the most powerful, and effectually
prevented him from rescuing the deed until it was fairly reduced to a
cinder.They then quitted hold of each other, and the enthusiast,
rendered fiercer by the contest, glared on Morton with an eye expressive
of frantic revenge."Thou hast my secret," he exclaimed; "thou must be mine, or die!""I contemn your threats," said Morton; "I pity you, and leave you."But as he turned to retire, Burley stept before him, pushed the oak-trunk
from its resting place, and as it fell thundering and crashing into the
abyss beneath, drew his sword, and cried out, with a voice that rivalled
the roar of the cataract and the thunder of the falling oak, "Now thou
art at bay!and standing in the mouth of the
cavern, he flourished his naked sword."I will not fight with the man that preserved my father's life," said
Morton."I have not yet learned to say the words, 'I yield;' and my life
I will rescue as I best can."So speaking, and ere Balfour was aware of his purpose, he sprung past
him, and exerting that youthful agility of which he possessed an uncommon
share, leaped clear across the fearful chasm which divided the mouth of
the cave from the projecting rock on the opposite side, and stood there
safe and free from his incensed enemy.He immediately ascended the
ravine, and, as he turned, saw Burley stand for an instant aghast with
astonishment, and then, with the frenzy of disappointed rage, rush into
the interior of his cavern.It was not difficult for him to perceive that this unhappy man's mind had
been so long agitated by desperate schemes and sudden disappointments
that it had lost its equipoise, and that there was now in his conduct a
shade of lunacy, not the less striking, from the vigour and craft with
which he pursued his wild designs.Morton soon joined his guide, who had
been terrified by the fall of the oak.This he represented as accidental;
and she assured him, in return, that the inhabitant of the cave would
experience no inconvenience from it, being always provided with materials
to construct another bridge.The adventures of the morning were not yet ended.As they approached the
hut, the little girl made an exclamation of surprise at seeing her
grandmother groping her way towards them, at a greater distance from her
home than she could have been supposed capable of travelling.said the old woman, when she heard them approach, "gin
e'er ye loved Lord Evandale, help now, or never!God be praised that left
my hearing when he took my poor eyesight!Peggy, hinny, gang saddle the gentleman's horse, and
lead him cannily ahint the thorny shaw, and bide him there."She conducted him to a small window, through which, himself unobserved,
he could see two dragoons seated at their morning draught of ale, and
conversing earnestly together."The more I think of it," said the one, "the less I like it, Inglis;
Evandale was a good officer and the soldier's friend; and though we were
punished for the mutiny at Tillietudlem, yet, by ---, Frank, you must own
we deserved it.""D--n seize me if I forgive him for it, though!"replied the other; "and
I think I can sit in his skirts now.""Why, man, you should forget and forgive.Better take the start with him
along with the rest, and join the ranting Highlanders.We have all eat
King James's bread.""Thou art an ass; the start, as you call it, will never happen,--the
day's put off.Halliday's seen a ghost, or Miss Bellenden's fallen sick
of the pip, or some blasted nonsense or another; the thing will never
keep two days longer, and the first bird that sings out will get the
reward.""That's true too," answered his comrade; "and will this fellow--this
Basil Olifant--pay handsomely?""Like a prince, man," said Inglis."Evandale is the man on earth whom he
hates worst, and he fears him, besides, about some law business; and were
he once rubbed out of the way, all, he thinks, will be his own.""But shall we have warrants and force enough?""Few people here will stir against my lord, and we may find him with some
of our own fellows at his back.""Thou 'rt a cowardly fool, Dick," returned Inglis; "he is living quietly
down at Fairy Knowe to avoid suspicion.Olifant is a magistrate, and will
have some of his own people that he can trust along with him.There are
us two, and the laird says he can get a desperate fighting Whig fellow,
called Quintin Mackell, that has an old grudge at Evandale.""Well, well, you are my officer, you know," said the private, with true
military conscience, "and if anything is wrong--"

"I'll take the blame," said Inglis."Come, another pot of ale, and let us
to Tillietudlem.--Here, blind Bess!--Why, where the devil has the old hag
crept to?""Delay them as long as you can," whispered Morton, as he thrust his purse
into the hostess's hand; "all depends on gaining time."Then, walking swiftly to the place where the girl held his horse ready,
"To Fairy Knowe?Wittenbold, the commandant there, will readily give me the
support of a troop, and procure me the countenance of the civil power.I
must drop a caution as I pass.--Come, Moorkopf," he said, addressing his
horse as he mounted him, "this day must try your breath and speed."Yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw,
          Though less and less of Emily he saw;
          So, speechless for a little space he lay,
          Then grasp'd the hand he held, and sigh'd his soul away.The indisposition of Edith confined her to bed during the eventful day on
which she had received such an unexpected shock from the sudden
apparition of Morton.Next morning, however, she was reported to be so
much better that Lord Evandale resumed his purpose of leaving Fairy
Knowe.At a late hour in the forenoon Lady Emily entered the apartment of
Edith with a peculiar gravity of manner.Having received and paid the
compliments of the day, she observed it would be a sad one for her,
though it would relieve Miss Bellenden of an encumbrance: "My brother
leaves us today, Miss Bellenden."exclaimed Edith, in surprise; "for his own house, I trust?""I have reason to think he meditates a more distant journey," answered
Lady Emily; "he has little to detain him in this country."exclaimed Edith, "why was I born to become the wreck of
all that is manly and noble!What can be done to stop him from running
headlong on ruin?I will come down instantly.--Say that I implore he will
not depart until I speak with him.""It will be in vain, Miss Bellenden; but I will execute your commission;"
and she left the room as formally as she had entered it, and informed her
brother Miss Bellenden was so much recovered as to propose coming
downstairs ere he went away."I suppose," she added pettishly, "the prospect of being speedily
released from our company has wrought a cure on her shattered nerves.""Sister," said Lord Evandale, "you are unjust, if not envious.""Unjust I maybe, Evandale, but I should not have dreamt," glancing her
eye at a mirror, "of being thought envious without better cause.But let
us go to the old lady; she is making a feast in the other room which
might have dined all your troop when you had one."Lord Evandale accompanied her in silence to the parlour, for he knew it
was in vain to contend with her prepossessions and offended pride.They
found the table covered with refreshments, arranged under the careful
inspection of Lady Margaret."Ye could hardly weel be said to breakfast this morning, my Lord
Evandale, and ye maun e'en partake of a small collation before ye ride,
such as this poor house, whose inmates are so much indebted to you, can
provide in their present circumstances.For my ain part, I like to see
young folk take some refection before they ride out upon their sports or
their affairs, and I said as much to his most sacred Majesty when he
breakfasted at Tillietudlem in the year of grace sixteen hundred and
fifty-one; and his most sacred Majesty was pleased to reply, drinking to
my health at the same time in a flagon of Rhenish wine, 'Lady Margaret,
ye speak like a Highland oracle.'These were his Majesty's very words;
so that your lordship may judge whether I have not good authority to
press young folk to partake of their vivers."It may be well supposed that much of the good lady's speech failed Lord
Evandale's ears, which were then employed in listening for the light step
of Edith.His absence of mind on this occasion, however natural, cost him
very dear.While Lady Margaret was playing the kind hostess,--a part she
delighted and excelled in,--she was interrupted by John Gudyill, who, in
the natural phrase for announcing an inferior to the mistress of a
family, said, "There was ane wanting to speak to her leddyship."Ye speak as if I kept a shop, and was to
come at everybody's whistle.""Yes, he has a name," answered John, "but your leddyship likes ill to
hear't.""It's Calf-Gibbie, my leddy," said John, in a tone rather above the pitch
of decorous respect, on which he occasionally trespassed, confiding in
his merit as an ancient servant of the family and a faithful follower of
their humble fortunes,--"It's Calf-Gibbie, an your leddyship will hae't,
that keeps Edie Henshaw's kye down yonder at the Brigg-end,--that's him
that was Guse-Gibbie at Tillietudlem, and gaed to the wappinshaw, and
that--"

"Hold your peace, John," said the old lady, rising in dignity; "you are
very insolent to think I wad speak wi' a person like that.Let him tell
his business to you or Mrs."He'll no hear o' that, my leddy; he says them that sent him bade him gie
the thing to your leddyship's ain hand direct, or to Lord Evandale's, he
wots na whilk.But, to say the truth, he's far frae fresh, and he's but
an idiot an he were.""Then turn him out," said Lady Margaret, "and tell him to come back
to-morrow when he is sober.I suppose he comes to crave some benevolence,
as an ancient follower o' the house.""Like eneugh, my leddy, for he's a' in rags, poor creature."Gudyill made another attempt to get at Gibbie's commission, which was
indeed of the last importance, being a few lines from Morton to Lord
Evandale, acquainting him with the danger in which he stood from the
practices of Olifant, and exhorting him either to instant flight, or else
to come to Glasgow and surrender himself, where he could assure him of
protection.This billet, hastily written, he intrusted to Gibbie, whom he
saw feeding his herd beside the bridge, and backed with a couple of
dollars his desire that it might instantly be delivered into the hand to
which it was addressed.But it was decreed that Goose-Gibbie's intermediation, whether as an
emissary or as a man-at-arms, should be unfortunate to the family of
Tillietudlem.He unluckily tarried so long at the ale-house to prove if
his employer's coin was good that, when he appeared at Fairy Knowe, the
little sense which nature had given him was effectually drowned in ale
and brandy; and instead of asking for Lord Evandale, he demanded to speak
with Lady Margaret, whose name was more familiar to his ear.Being
refused admittance to her presence, he staggered away with the letter
undelivered, perversely faithful to Morton's instructions in the only
point in which it would have been well had he departed from them.A few minutes after he was gone, Edith entered the apartment.Lord
Evandale and she met with mutual embarrassment, which Lady Margaret, who
only knew in general that their union had been postponed by her
granddaughter's indisposition, set down to the bashfulness of a bride and
bridegroom, and, to place them at ease, began to talk to Lady Emily on
indifferent topics.At this moment Edith, with a countenance as pale as
death, muttered, rather than whispered, to Lord Evandale a request to
speak with him.He offered his arm, and supported her into the small
ante-room, which, as we have noticed before, opened from the parlour.He
placed her in a chair, and, taking one himself, awaited the opening of
the conversation."I am distressed, my lord," were the first words she was able to
articulate, and those with difficulty; "I scarce know what I would say,
nor how to speak it.""If I have any share in occasioning your uneasiness," said Lord Evandale,
mildly, "you will soon, Edith, be released from it.""You are determined then, my lord," she replied, "to run this desperate
course with desperate men, in spite of your own better reason, in spite
of your friends' entreaties, in spite of the almost inevitable ruin which
yawns before you?""Forgive me, Miss Bellenden; even your solicitude on my account must not
detain me when my honour calls.My horses stand ready saddled, my
servants are prepared, the signal for rising will be given so soon as I
reach Kilsyth.If it is my fate that calls me, I will not shun meeting
it.It will be something," he said, taking her hand, "to die deserving
your compassion, since I cannot gain your love."said Edith, in a tone which went to his heart;
"time may explain the strange circumstance which has shocked me so much;
my agitated nerves may recover their tranquillity.Oh, do not rush on
death and ruin!remain to be our prop and stay, and hope everything from
time!""It is too late, Edith," answered Lord Evandale; "and I were most
ungenerous could I practise on the warmth and kindliness of your feelings
towards me.I know you cannot love me; nervous distress, so strong as to
conjure up the appearance of the dead or absent, indicates a predilection
too powerful to give way to friendship and gratitude alone.But were it
otherwise, the die is now cast."As he spoke thus, Cuddie burst into the room, terror and haste in his
countenance."Oh, my lord, hide yoursell!they hae beset the outlets o'
the house," was his first exclamation."A party of horse, headed by Basil Olifant," answered Cuddie.echoed Edith, in an agony of terror."What right has the
villain to assail me or stop my passage?I will make my way, were he
backed by a regiment; tell Halliday and Hunter to get out the horses.--
And now, farewell, Edith!"He clasped her in his arms, and kissed her
tenderly; then, bursting from his sister, who, with Lady Margaret,
endeavoured to detain him, rushed out and mounted his horse.All was in confusion; the women shrieked and hurried in consternation to
the front windows of the house, from which they could see a small party
of horsemen, of whom two only seemed soldiers.They were on the open
ground before Cuddie's cottage, at the bottom of the descent from the
house, and showed caution in approaching it, as if uncertain of the
strength within.said Edith; "oh, would he but take the
by-road!"But Lord Evandale, determined to face a danger which his high spirit
undervalued, commanded his servants to follow him, and rode composedly
down the avenue.Old Gudyill ran to arm himself, and Cuddie snatched down
a gun which was kept for the protection of the house, and, although on
foot, followed Lord Evandale.It was in vain his wife, who had hurried up
on the alarm, hung by his skirts, threatening him with death by the sword
or halter for meddling with other folk's matters."Hand your peace, ye b----," said Cuddie; "and that's braid Scotch, or I
wotna what is.Is it ither folk's matters to see Lord Evandale murdered
before my face?"But considering on the
way that he composed the whole infantry, as John Gudyill had not
appeared, he took his vantage ground behind the hedge, hammered his
flint, cocked his piece, and, taking a long aim at Laird Basil, as he was
called, stood prompt for action.As soon as Lord Evandale appeared, Olifant's party spread themselves a
little, as if preparing to enclose him.Their leader stood fast,
supported by three men, two of whom were dragoons, the third in dress and
appearance a countryman, all well armed.But the strong figure, stern
features, and resolved manner of the third attendant made him seem the
most formidable of the party; and whoever had before seen him could have
no difficulty in recognising Balfour of Burley."Follow me," said Lord Evandale to his servants, "and if we are forcibly
opposed, do as I do."He advanced at a hand gallop towards Olifant, and
was in the act of demanding why he had thus beset the road, when Olifant
called out, "Shoot the traitor!"and the whole four fired their carabines
upon the unfortunate nobleman.He reeled in the saddle, advanced his
hand to the holster, and drew a pistol, but, unable to discharge it, fell
from his horse mortally wounded.His servants had presented their
carabines.Hunter fired at random; but Halliday, who was an intrepid
fellow, took aim at Inglis, and shot him dead on the spot.At the same
instant a shot from behind the hedge still more effectually avenged Lord
Evandale, for the ball took place in the very midst of Basil Olifant's
forehead, and stretched him lifeless on the ground.His followers,
astonished at the execution done in so short a time, seemed rather
disposed to stand inactive, when Burley, whose blood was up with the
contest, exclaimed, "Down with the Midianites!"At this instant the clatter of horses' hoofs was heard,
and a party of horse, rapidly advancing on the road from Glasgow,
appeared on the fatal field.They were foreign dragoons, led by the Dutch
commandant Wittenbold, accompanied by Morton and a civil magistrate.A hasty call to surrender, in the name of God and King William, was
obeyed by all except Burley, who turned his horse and attempted to
escape.Several soldiers pursued him by command of their officer, but,
being well mounted, only the two headmost seemed likely to gain on him.He turned deliberately twice, and discharging first one of his pistols,
and then the other, rid himself of the one pursuer by mortally wounding
him, and of the other by shooting his horse, and then continued his
flight to Bothwell Bridge, where, for his misfortune, he found the gates
shut and guarded.Turning from thence, he made for a place where the
river seemed passable, and plunged into the stream, the bullets from the
pistols and carabines of his pursuers whizzing around him.Two balls took
effect when he was past the middle of the stream, and he felt himself
dangerously wounded.He reined his horse round in the midst of the river,
and returned towards the bank he had left, waving his hand, as if with
the purpose of intimating that he surrendered.The troopers ceased firing
at him accordingly, and awaited his return, two of them riding a little
way into the river to seize and disarm him.But it presently appeared
that his purpose was revenge, not safety.As he approached the two
soldiers, he collected his remaining strength, and discharged a blow on
the head of one, which tumbled him from his horse.The other dragoon, a
strong, muscular man, had in the mean while laid hands on him.Burley, in
requital, grasped his throat, as a dying tiger seizes his prey, and both,
losing the saddle in the struggle, came headlong into the river, and were
swept down the stream.Their course might be traced by the blood which
bubbled up to the surface.They were twice seen to rise, the Dutchman
striving to swim, and Burley clinging to him in a manner that showed his
desire that both should perish.Their corpses were taken out about a
quarter of a mile down the river.As Balfour's grasp could not have been
unclenched without cutting off his hands, both were thrown into a hasty
grave, still marked by a rude stone and a ruder epitaph.[Gentle reader, I did request of mine honest friend Peter Proudfoot,
     travelling merchant, known to many of this land for his faithful and
     just dealings, as well in muslins and cambrics as in small wares, to
     procure me on his next peregrinations to that vicinage, a copy of
     the Epitaphion alluded to.And, according to his report, which I see
     no ground to discredit, it runneth thus:--

               Here lyes ane saint to prelates surly,
               Being John Balfour, sometime of Burley,
               Who stirred up to vengeance take,
               For Solemn League and Cov'nant's sake,
               Upon the Magus-Moor in Fife,
               Did tak James Sharpe the apostate's life;
               By Dutchman's hands was hacked and shot,
               Then drowned in Clyde near this saam spot.]While the soul of this stern enthusiast flitted to its account, that of
the brave and generous Lord Evandale was also released.Morton had flung
himself from his horse upon perceiving his situation, to render his dying
friend all the aid in his power.He knew him, for he pressed his hand,
and, being unable to speak, intimated by signs his wish to be conveyed to
the house.This was done with all the care possible, and he was soon
surrounded by his lamenting friends.But the clamorous grief of Lady
Emily was far exceeded in intensity by the silent agony of Edith.Unconscious even of the presence of Morton, she hung over the dying man;
nor was she aware that Fate, who was removing one faithful lover, had
restored another as if from the grave, until Lord Evandale, taking their
hands in his, pressed them both affectionately, united them together,
raised his face as if to pray for a blessing on them, and sunk back and
expired in the next moment.I had determined to waive the task of a concluding chapter, leaving to
the reader's imagination the arrangements which must necessarily take
place after Lord Evandale's death.But as I was aware that precedents are
wanting for a practice which might be found convenient both to readers
and compilers, I confess myself to have been in a considerable dilemma,
when fortunately I was honoured with an invitation to drink tea with Miss
Martha Buskbody, a young lady who has carried on the profession of
mantua-making at Ganderscleugh and in the neighbourhood, with great
success, for about forty years.Knowing her taste for narratives of this
description, I requested her to look over the loose sheets the morning
before I waited on her, and enlighten me by the experience which she must
have acquired in reading through the whole stock of three circulating
libraries, in Ganderscleugh and the two next market-towns.When, with a
palpitating heart, I appeared before her in the evening, I found her much
disposed to be complimentary."I have not been more affected," said she, wiping the glasses of her
spectacles, "by any novel, excepting the 'Tale of Jemmy and Jenny
Jessamy', which is indeed pathos itself; but your plan of omitting a
formal conclusion will never do.You may be as harrowing to our nerves as
you will in the course of your story, but, unless you had the genius
of the author of 'Julia de Roubignd,' never let the end be altogether
overclouded.Let us see a glimpse of sunshine in the last chapter; it is
quite essential.""Nothing would be more easy for me, madam, than to comply with your
injunctions; for, in truth, the parties in whom you have had the goodness
to be interested, did live long and happily, and begot sons and
daughters.""It is unnecessary, sir," she said, with a slight nod of reprimand, "to
be particular concerning their matrimonial comforts.But what is your
objection to let us have, in a general way, a glimpse of their future
felicity?""Really, madam," said I, "you must be aware that every volume of a
narrative turns less and less interesting as the author draws to a
conclusion,--just like your tea, which, though excellent hyson, is
necessarily weaker and more insipid in the last cup.Now, as I think the
one is by no means improved by the luscious lump of half-dissolved sugar
usually found at the bottom of it, so I am of opinion that a history,
growing already vapid, is but dully crutched up by a detail of
circumstances which every reader must have anticipated, even though the
author exhaust on them every flowery epithet in the language."Pattieson," continued the lady; "you have, as I
may say, basted up your first story very hastily and clumsily at the
conclusion; and, in my trade, I would have cuffed the youngest apprentice
who had put such a horrid and bungled spot of work out of her hand.And
if you do not redeem this gross error by telling us all about the
marriage of Morton and Edith, and what became of the other personages of
the story, from Lady Margaret down to Goose-Gibbie, I apprise you that
you will not be held to have accomplished your task handsomely.""Well, madam," I replied, "my materials are so ample that I think I can
satisfy your curiosity, unless it descend to very minute circumstances
indeed.""First, then," said she, "for that is most essential,--Did Lady Margaret
get back her fortune and her castle?""She did, madam, and in the easiest way imaginable, as heir, namely, to
her worthy cousin, Basil Olifant, who died without a will; and thus, by
his death, not only restored, but even augmented, the fortune of her,
whom, during his life, he had pursued with the most inveterate malice.John Gudyill, reinstated in his dignity, was more important than ever;
and Cuddie, with rapturous delight, entered upon the cultivation of the
mains of Tillietudlem, and the occupation of his original cottage.But,
with the shrewd caution of his character, he was never heard to boast of
having fired the lucky shot which repossessed his lady and himself in
their original habitations.'After a',' he said to Jenny, who was his
only confidant, 'auld Basil Olifant was my leddy's cousin and a grand
gentleman; and though he was acting again the law, as I understand, for
he ne'er showed ony warrant, or required Lord Evandale to surrender, and
though I mind killing him nae mair than I wad do a muircock, yet it's
just as weel to keep a calm sough about it.'He not only did so, but
ingeniously enough countenanced a report that old Gudyill had done the
deed,--which was worth many a gill of brandy to him from the old butler,
who, far different in disposition from Cuddie, was much more inclined to
exaggerate than suppress his exploits of manhood.The blind widow was
provided for in the most comfortable manner, as well as the little guide
to the Linn; and--"

"But what is all this to the marriage,--the marriage of the principal
personages?"interrupted Miss Buskbody, impatiently tapping her
snuff-box."The marriage of Morton and Miss Bellenden was delayed for several
months, as both went into deep mourning on account of Lord Evandale's
death."I hope not without Lady Margaret's consent, sir?""I love books which teach a proper deference in young persons to their
parents.In a novel the young people may fall in love without their
countenance, because it is essential to the necessary intricacy of the
story; but they must always have the benefit of their consent at last.Even old Delville received Cecilia, though the daughter of a man of low
birth.""And even so, madam," replied I, "Lady Margaret was prevailed on to
countenance Morton, although the old Covenanter, his father, stuck sorely
with her for some time.Edith was her only hope, and she wished to see
her happy; Morton, or Melville Morton, as he was more generally called,
stood so high in the reputation of the world, and was in every other
respect such an eligible match, that she put her prejudice aside, and
consoled herself with the recollection that marriage went by destiny, as
was observed to her, she said, by his most sacred Majesty, Charles the
Second of happy memory, when she showed him the portrait of her
grand-father Fergus, third Earl of Torwood, the handsomest man of his
time, and that of Countess Jane, his second lady, who had a hump-back
and only one eye.This was his Majesty's observation, she said, on one
remarkable morning when he deigned to take his _disjune_--"

"Nay," said Miss Buskbody, again interrupting me, "if she brought such
authority to countenance her acquiescing in a misalliance, there was no
more to be said.--And what became of old Mrs.What's her name, the
housekeeper?""She was perhaps the happiest of the
party; for once a year, and not oftener, Mr.Melville Morton
dined in the great wainscotted chamber in solemn state, the hangings
being all displayed, the carpet laid down, and the huge brass candlestick
set on the table, stuck round with leaves of laurel.The preparing the
room for this yearly festival employed her mind for six months before it
came about, and the putting matters to rights occupied old Alison the
other six, so that a single day of rejoicing found her business for all
the year round.""Lived to a good old age, drank ale and brandy with guests of all
persuasions, played Whig or Jacobite tunes as best pleased his customers,
and died worth as much money as married Jenny to a cock laird.I hope,
ma'am, you have no other inquiries to make, for really--"

"Goose-Gibbie, sir?"said my persevering friend,--"Goose-Gibbie, whose
ministry was fraught with such consequences to the personages of the
narrative?""Consider, my dear Miss Buskbody, (I beg pardon for the
familiarity),--but pray consider, even the memory of the renowned
Scheherazade, that Empress of Tale-tellers, could not preserve every
circumstance.I am not quite positive as to the fate of Goose-Gibbie,
but am inclined to think him the same with one Gilbert Dudden, alias
Calf-Gibbie, who was whipped through Hamilton for stealing poultry."Miss Buskbody now placed her left foot on the fender, crossed her right
leg over her knee, lay back on the chair, and looked towards the ceiling.When I observed her assume this contemplative mood, I concluded she was
studying some farther cross-examination, and therefore took my hat and
wished her a hasty good-night, ere the Demon of Criticism had supplied
her with any more queries.In like manner, gentle Reader, returning you
my thanks for the patience which has conducted you thus far, I take the
liberty to withdraw myself from you for the present.It was mine earnest wish, most courteous Reader, that the "Tales of my
Landlord" should have reached thine hands in one entire succession of
tomes, or volumes.But as I sent some few more manuscript quires,
containing the continuation of these most pleasing narratives, I was
apprised, somewhat unceremoniously, by my publisher that he did not
approve of novels (as he injuriously called these real histories)
extending beyond four volumes, and if I did not agree to the first four
being published separately, he threatened to decline the article.as if the vernacular article of our mother English were
capable of declension.)Whereupon, somewhat moved by his remonstrances,
and more by heavy charges for print and paper, which he stated to have
been already incurred, I have resolved that these four volumes shall be
the heralds or avant-couriers of the Tales which are yet in my
possession, nothing doubting that they will be eagerly devoured, and the
remainder anxiously demanded, by the unanimous voice of a discerning
public.I rest, esteemed Reader, thine as thou shalt construe me,

next?--what can the writer mean by offering such nonsense for our
perusal?” There is no creature, reader, however insignificant and
unimportant in the great scale of creation it may appear to us,
short-sighted mortals that we are, which is forgotten in the care of
our own common Creator; not a sparrow falls to the ground unknown and
unpermitted by Him; and whether or not you may derive interest from the
biography even of a mouse, you will be able to form a better judgment,
after, than before, having read my paper.The mouse belongs to the class _Mammalia_, or the animals which rear
their young by suckling them; to the order _Rodentia_, or animals whose
teeth are adapted for _gnawing_; to the genus _Mus_, or Rat kind, and the
family of _Mus musculus_, or domestic mouse.The mouse is a singularly
beautiful little animal, as no one who examines it attentively, and
without prejudice, can fail to discover.Its little body is plump and
sleek; its neck short; its head tapering and graceful; and its eyes
large, prominent, and sparkling.Its manners are lively and interesting,
its agility surprising, and its habits extremely cleanly.There are
several varieties of this little creature, amongst which the best known
is the common brown mouse of our granaries and store-rooms; the Albino,
or white mouse, with red eyes; and the black and white mouse, which is
more rare and very delicate.I mention these as _varieties_, for I think
we may safely regard them as such, from the fact of their propagating
unchanged, preserving their difference of hue to the fiftieth generation,
and never accidentally occurring amongst the offspring of differently
 parents.It is of the white mouse that I am now about to treat, and it is an
account of a tame individual of that extremely pretty variety that is
designed to form the subject of my present paper.When I was a boy of about sixteen, I got possession of a white mouse; the
little creature was very wild and unsocial at first, but by dint of care
and discipline I succeeded in rendering it familiar.The principal agent
I employed towards effecting its domestication was a singular one, and
which, though I can assure the reader its effects are speedy and certain,
still remains to me inexplicable: this was, ducking in cold water; and by
resorting to this simple expedient, I have since succeeded in rendering
even the rat as tame and as playful as a kitten.It is out of my power to
explain the manner in which _ducking_ operates on the animal subjected to
it, but I wish that some physiologist more experienced than I am would
give his attention to the subject, and favour the public with the result
of his reflections.At the time that I obtained possession of this mouse, I was residing at
Olney, in Buckinghamshire, a village which I presume my readers will
recollect as connected with the names of Newton and Cowper; but shortly
after having succeeded in rendering it pretty tame, circumstances
required my removal to Gloucester, whither I carried my little favourite
with me.During the journey I kept the mouse confined in a small wire
cage; but while resting at the inn where I passed the night, I adopted
the precaution of enveloping the cage in a handkerchief, lest by some
untoward circumstance its active little inmate might make its escape.Having thus, as I thought, made all safe, I retired to rest.The moment
I awoke in the morning, I sprang from my bed, and went to examine the
cage, when, to my infinite consternation, I found it empty!I searched
the bed, the room, raised the carpet, examined every nook and corner, but
all to no purpose.I dressed myself as hastily as I could, and summoning
one of the waiters, an intelligent, good-natured man, I informed
him of my loss, and got him to search every room in the house.His
investigations, however, proved equally unavailing, and I gave my poor
little pet completely up, inwardly hoping, despite of its ingratitude
in leaving me, that it might meet with some agreeable mate amongst its
brown congeners, and might lead a long and happy life, unchequered by
the terrors of the prowling cat, and unendangered by the more insidious
artifices of the fatal trap.With these reflections I was just getting
into the coach which was to convey me upon my road, when a waiter came
running to the door, out of breath, exclaiming, “Mr R., Mr R., I declare
your little mouse is in the kitchen.” Begging the coachman to wait an
instant, I followed the man to the kitchen, and there, on the hob,
seated contentedly in a pudding dish, and devouring its contents with
considerable _gout_, was my truant protegé.Once more secured within
its cage, and the latter carefully enveloped in a sheet of strong brown
paper, upon my knee, I reached Gloucester.I was here soon subjected to a similar alarm, for one morning the cage
was again empty, and my efforts to discover the retreat of the wanderer
unavailing as before.This time I had lost him for a week, when one
night, in getting into bed, I heard a scrambling in the curtains, and on
relighting my candle found the noise to have been occasioned by my mouse,
who seemed equally pleased with myself at our reunion.After having thus
lost and found my little friend a number of times, I gave up the idea
of confining him; and, accordingly, leaving the door of his cage open,
I placed it in a corner of my bedroom, and allowed him to go in and out
as he pleased.Of this permission he gladly availed himself, but would
regularly return to me at intervals of a week or a fortnight, and at such
periods of return he was usually much thinner than ordinary; and it was
pretty clear that during his visits to his brown acquaintances he fared
by no means so well as he did at home.Sometimes, when he happened to return, as he often did, in the
night-time, on which occasions his general custom was to come into bed to
me, I used, in order to induce him to remain with me until morning, to
immerse him in a basin of water, and then let him lie in my bosom, the
warmth of which, after his cold bath, commonly ensured his stay.Frequently, while absent on one of his excursions, I would hear an
unusual noise in the wainscot, as I lay in bed, of dozens of mice
running backwards and forwards in all directions, and squeaking in much
apparent glee.For some time I was puzzled to know whether this unusual
disturbance was the result of merriment or quarrelling, and I often
trembled for the safety of my pet, alone and unaided, among so many
strangers.But a very interesting circumstance occurred one morning,
which perfectly reassured me.It was a bright summer morning, about four
o’clock, and I was lying awake, reflecting as to the propriety of turning
on my pillow to take another sleep, or at once rising, and going forth to
enjoy the beauties of awakening nature.While thus meditating, I heard a
slight scratching in the wainscot, and looking towards the spot whence
the noise proceeded, perceived the head of a mouse peering from a hole.It was instantly withdrawn, but a second was thrust forth.This latter I
at once recognised as my own white friend, but so begrimed by soot and
dirt that it required an experienced eye to distinguish him from his
darker-coated entertainers.He emerged from the hole, and running over
to his cage, entered it, and remained for a couple of seconds within
it; he then returned to the wainscot, and, re-entering the hole, some
scrambling and squeaking took place.A second time he came forth, and on
this occasion was followed closely, to my no small astonishment, by a
brown mouse, who followed him, with much apparent timidity and caution,
to his box, and entered it along with him.More astonished at this
singular proceeding than I can well express, I lay fixed in mute and
breathless attention, to see what would follow next.In about a minute
the two mice came forth from the cage, each bearing in its mouth a large
piece of bread, which they dragged towards the hole they had previously
left.On arriving at it, they entered, but speedily re-appeared, having
deposited their burden; and repairing once more to the cage, again loaded
themselves with provision, and conveyed it away.This second time they
remained within the hole for a much longer period than the first time;
and when they again made their appearance, they were attended by three
other mice, who, following their leaders to the cage, loaded themselves
with bread as did they, and carried away their burdens to the hole.After
this I saw them no more that morning, and on rising I discovered that
they had carried away every particle of food that the cage contained.Nor
was this an isolated instance of their white guest leading them forth to
where he knew they should find provender.Day after day, whatever bread
or grain I left in the cage was regularly removed, and the duration of my
pet’s absence was proportionately long.Wishing to learn whether hunger
was the actual cause of his return, I no longer left food in his box; and
in about a week afterwards, on awaking one morning, I found him sleeping
upon the pillow, close to my face, having partly wormed his way under my
cheek.There was a cat in the house, an excellent mouser, and I dreaded lest she
should one day meet with and destroy my poor mouse, and I accordingly
used all my exertions with those in whose power it was, to obtain her
dismissal.She was, however, regarded by those persons as infinitely
better entitled to protection and patronage than a mouse, so I was
compelled to put up with her presence.People are fond of imputing to
cats a supernatural degree of sagacity: they will sometimes go so far
as to pronounce them to be genuine _witches_; and really I am scarcely
surprised at it, nor perhaps will the reader be, when I tell him the
following anecdote.I was one day entering my apartment, when I was filled with horror at
perceiving my mouse picking up some crumbs upon the carpet, beneath
the table, and the terrible cat seated upon a chair watching him with
what appeared to me to be an expression of sensual anticipation and
concentrated desire.Before I had time to interfere, Puss sprang from
her chair, and bounded towards the mouse, who, however, far from being
terrified at the approach of his natural enemy, scarcely so much as
favoured her with a single look.Puss raised her paw and dealt him a
gentle tap, when, judge of my astonishment if you can, the little mouse,
far from running away, or betraying any marks of fear, raised himself
on his legs, cocked his tail, and with a shrill and angry squeak, with
which any that have kept tame mice are well acquainted, sprang at and
positively _bit_ the paw which had struck him.I could
not jump forward to the rescue.I was, as it were, petrified where I
stood.But, stranger than all, the cat, instead of appearing irritated,
or seeming to design mischief, merely stretched out her nose and smelt
at her diminutive assailant, and then resuming her place upon the chair,
purred herself to sleep.I need not say that I immediately secured the
mouse within his cage.Whether the cat on this occasion knew the little
animal to be a pet, and as such feared to meddle with it, or whether its
boldness had disarmed her, I cannot pretend to explain: I merely state
the fact; and I think the reader will allow that it is sufficiently
extraordinary.In order to guard against such a dangerous encounter for the future,
I got a more secure cage made, of which the bars were so close as to
preclude the possibility of egress; and singularly enough, many a morning
was I amused by beholding brown mice coming from their holes in the
wainscot, and approaching the cage in which their friend was kept, as if
in order to condole with him on the subject of his unwonted captivity.Secure, however, as I conceived this new cage to be, my industrious pet
contrived to make his escape from it, and in doing so met his death.In
my room was a large bureau, with deep, old-fashioned, capacious drawers.Being obliged to go from home for a day, I put the cage containing my
little friend into one of these drawers, lest any one should attempt to
meddle with it during my absence.On returning, I opened the drawer,
and just as I did so, heard a faint squeak, and at the same instant my
poor little pet fell from the back of the drawer--lifeless.I took up
his body, and, placing it in my bosom, did my best to restore it to
animation.His little body had been crushed
in the crevice at the back part of the drawer, through which he had been
endeavouring to escape, and he was really and irrecoverably gone.*       *       *       *       *

NOTE ON THE FEEDING, &C., OF WHITE MICE.--Such of my juvenile readers
as may be disposed to make a pet of one of these interesting little
animals, would do well to observe the following rules:--Clean the cage
out daily, and keep it dry; do not keep it in too cold a place; in
winter it should be kept in a room in which there is a fire.Feed the
mice on bread steeped in milk, having first squeezed the milk out, as
too moist food is bad for them.Never give them cheese, as it is apt to
produce fatal disorders, though the more hardy brown mice eat it with
impunity.If you want to give them a treat, give them grains of wheat
or barley, or if these are not to be procured, oats or rice.A little
tin box of water should be constantly left in their cage, but securely
fixed, so that they cannot overturn it.Let the wires be not too slight,
or too long, otherwise the little animals will easily squeeze themselves
between them, and let them be of iron, never of copper, as the animals
are fond of nibbling at them, and the rust of the latter, or _verdigris_,
would quickly poison them.White mice are to be procured at most of the
bird-shops in Patrick’s Close, Dublin; of the wire-workers and bird-cage
makers in Edinburgh; and from all the animal fanciers in London,
whose residences are to be found chiefly on the New Road and about
Knightsbridge.Their prices vary from one shilling to two-and-sixpence
per pair, according to their age and beauty.H. D. R.




THE PROFESSIONS.If what are called the liberal professions could speak, they would
all utter the one cry, “we are overstocked;” and echo would reply
“overstocked.” This has long been a subject of complaint, and yet nobody
seems inclined to mend the matter by making any sacrifice on his own
part--just as in a crowd, to use a familiar illustration, the man who is
loudest in exclaiming “dear me, what pressing and jostling people do keep
here!” never thinks of lightening the pressure by withdrawing his own
person from the mass.There is, however, an advantage to be derived from
the utterance and reiteration of the complaint, if not by those already
in the press, at least by those who are still happily clear of it.There are many “vanities and vexations of spirit” under the sun, but this
evil of professional redundancy seems to be one of very great magnitude.It involves not merely an outlay of much precious time and substance to
no purpose, but in most cases unfits those who constitute the “excess”
from applying themselves afterwards to other pursuits.Such persons are
the primary sufferers; but the community at large participates in the
loss.It cannot but be interesting to inquire to what this tendency may be
owing, and what remedy it might be useful to apply to the evil.Now, it
strikes me that the great cause is the exclusive attention which people
pay to the great prizes, and their total inconsideration of the number of
blanks which accompany them.Life itself has been compared to a lottery;
but in some departments the scheme may be so particularly bad, that it is
nothing short of absolute gambling to purchase a share in it.A few arrive at great eminence, and these few excite the
envy and admiration of all beholders; but they are only a few compared
with the number of those who linger in the shade, and, however anxious to
enjoy the sport, never once get a rap at the ball.Again, parents are apt to look upon the mere name of a profession as a
provision for their children.They calculate all the expenses of general
education, professional education, and then of admission to “liberty to
practise;” and finding all these items amount to a tolerably large sum,
they conceive they have bestowed an ample portion on the son who has cost
them “thus much monies.” But unfortunately they soon learn by experience
that the elevation of a profession, great as it is, does not always
possess that homely recommendation of causing the “pot to boil,” and that
the individual for whom this costly provision has been made, cannot be so
soon left to shift for himself.Here then is another cause of this evil,
namely, that people do not adequately and fairly calculate the whole cost.Of our liberal professions, the army is the only one that yields a
certain income as the produce of the purchase money, But in these “piping
times of peace,” a private soldier in the ranks might as well attempt to
verify the old song, and

    “Spend half a crown out of sixpence a-day,”

as an ensign to pay mess-money and band-money, and all other regulation
monies, keep himself in dress coat and epaulettes, and all the other et
ceteras, upon his mere pay.To live in any
comfort in the army, a subaltern should have an income from some other
source, equal at least in amount to that which he receives through the
hands of the paymaster.The army is, in fact, an expensive profession,
and of all others the least agreeable to one who is prevented, by
circumscribed means, from doing as his brother officers do.Yet the
mistake of venturing to meet all these difficulties is not unfrequently
admitted, with what vain expectation it is needless to inquire.The usual
result is such as one would anticipate, namely, that the rash adventurer,
after incurring debts, or putting his friends to unlooked-for charges, is
obliged after a short time to sell out, and bid farewell for ever to the
unprofitable profession of arms.It would be painful to dwell upon the situation of those who enter other
professions without being duly prepared to wait their turn of employment.It is recognised as a poignantly applicable truth in the profession of
the bar, that “many are called but few are chosen;” but with very few and
rare exceptions indeed, the necessity of _biding_ the time is certain.In the legal and medical professions there is no fixed income, however
small, insured to the adventurer; and unless his circle of friends and
connections be very wide and serviceable indeed, he should make up his
mind for a procrastinated return and a late harvest.But how many from
day to day, and from year to year, do launch their bark upon the ocean,
without any such prudent foresight!The result therefore is, that vast
proportion of disastrous voyages and shipwrecks of which we hear so
constantly.Such is the admitted evil--it is granted on all sides.The question
is, what is to be done?--what is the remedy?Now, the remedy for an
overstocked profession very evidently is, that people should forbear to
enter it.I am no Malthusian on the subject of population: I desire no
unnatural checks upon the increase and multiplication of her Majesty’s
subjects; but I should like to drain off a surplus from certain
situations, and turn off the in-flowing stream into more profitable
channels.I would advise parents, then, to leave the choice of a liberal
profession to those who are able to live without one.Such parties can
afford to wait for advancement, however long it may be in coming, or to
bear up against disappointment, if such should be their lot.With such
it is a safe speculation, and they may be left to indulge in it, if they
think proper.But it will be asked, what is to
be done with the multitudes who would be diverted from the professions,
if this advice were acted upon?I answer, that the money unprofitably
spent upon their education, and in fees of admission to these expensive
pursuits, would insure them a “good location” and a certain provision
for life in Canada, or some of the colonies; and that any honourable
occupation which would yield a competency ought to be preferred to
“professions” which, however “liberal,” hold out to the many but a very
doubtful prospect of that result.It is much to be regretted that there is a prevalent notion among
certain of my countrymen that “trade” is not a “genteel” thing, and
that it must be eschewed by those who have any pretensions to fashion.This unfortunate, and I must say unsound state of opinion, contributes
also, I fear, in no small degree, to that professional redundancy of
which we have been speaking.The supposed absolute necessity of a high
classical education is a natural concomitant of this opinion.All our
schools therefore are eminently classical.The University follows, as a
matter of course, and then the University leads to a liberal profession,
as surely as one step of a ladder conducts to another.Thus the evil is
nourished at the very root.Now, I would take the liberty of advising
those parents who may concur with me in the main point of over-supply in
the professions, to begin at the beginning, and in the education of their
children, to exchange this superabundance of Greek and Latin for the less
elegant but more useful accomplishment of “ciphering.” I am disposed to
concur with that facetious but shrewd fellow, Mr Samuel Slick, upon the
inestimable advantages of that too much neglected art--neglected, I mean,
in our country here, Ireland.He has demonstrated that they do every
thing by it in the States, and that without it they could do nothing.With the most profound respect to my countrymen, then, I would earnestly
recommend them to cultivate it.But it may perhaps be said that there is
no encouragement to mercantile pursuits in Ireland, and that if there
were, there would be no necessity for me to recommend “ciphering” and
its virtues to the people.To this I answer, that merchandize offers
its prizes to the ingenious and venturous much rather than to those who
wait for a “highway” to be made for them.If people were resolved to
live by trade, I think they would contrive to do so--many more, at least,
than at present operate successfully in that department.If more of
education, and more of mind, were turned in that direction, new sources
of profitable industry, at present unthought of, would probably discover
themselves.Much might be said on this subject, but I shall not enter
further into the speculation, quite satisfied if I have thrown out a hint
which may be found capable of improvement by others.The rearing of geese might be more an object of attention to our small
farmers and labourers in the vicinity of bogs and mountain tracts than it
is.The general season for the consumption of fat geese is from Michaelmas to
Christmas, and the high prices paid for them in the English markets--to
which they can be so rapidly conveyed from many parts of Ireland--appear
to offer sufficient temptation to the speculator who has the capital and
accommodation necessary for fattening them.A well-organized system of feeding this hardy and nutritious species of
poultry, in favourable localities, would give a considerable impulse to
the rearing of them, and consequently promote the comforts of many poor
Irish families, who under existing circumstances do not find it worth
while to rear them except in very small numbers.I am led to offer a few suggestions on this subject from having
ascertained that in the Fens of Lincolnshire, notwithstanding a great
decrease there in the breeding of geese from extensive drainage, one
individual, Mr Clarke of Boston, fattens every year, between Michaelmas
and Christmas, the prodigious number of seven thousand geese, and that
another dealer at Spalding prepares for the poultry butcher nearly as
many: these they purchase in lots from the farmers’ wives.Perhaps a few details of the Lincolnshire practice may be acceptable to
some of the readers of this Journal:--

The farmers in the Fens keep breeding stocks proportioned to the extent
of suitable land which they can command; and in order to insure the
fertility of the eggs, they allow one gander to three geese, which is a
higher proportion of males than is deemed necessary elsewhere.The number
of goslings in each brood averages about ten, which, allowing for all
casualties, is a considerable produce.There have been extraordinary instances of individual fecundity, on
which, however, it would be as absurd for any goose-breeder to calculate,
as it is proverbially unwise to reckon chickens before they are hatched;
and this fruitfulness is only attainable by constant feeding with
stimulating food through the preceding winter.A goose has been known to lay seventy eggs within twelve months,
twenty-six in the spring, before the time of incubation, and (after
bringing out seventeen goslings) the remainder by the end of the year.The white variety is preferred to the grey or party-, as the
birds of this colour feed more kindly, and their feathers are worth three
shillings a stone more than the others: the quality of the land, however,
on which the breeding stock is to be maintained, decides this matter,
generally strong land being necessary for the support of the white or
larger kind.Under all circumstances a white gander is preferred, in
order to have a large progeny.It has been remarked, but I know not if
with reason, that ganders are more frequently white than the females.To state all the particulars of hatching and rearing would be
superfluous, and mere repetition of what is contained in the various
works on poultry.I shall merely state some of the peculiarities of the
practice in the county of Lincoln.When the young geese are brought up at different periods by the great
dealers, they are put into pens together, according to their age, size,
and condition, and fed on steamed potatoes and ground oats, in the ratio
of one measure of oats to three of potatoes.By unremitting care as to
cleanliness, pure water, and constant feeding, these geese are fattened
in about three weeks, at an average cost of one penny per day each.The _cramming_ system, either by the fingers or the forcing pump,
described by French writers, with the accompanying barbarities of
blinding, nailing the feet to the floor, or confinement in perforated
casks or earthen pots (as is said to be the case sometimes in Poland),
are happily unknown in Lincolnshire, and I may add throughout England,
with one exception--the nailing of the feet to boards.The unequivocal
proofs of this may occasionally, but very rarely, be seen in the geese
brought into the London markets: these, however, may possibly be imported
ones, though I fear they are not so.The Lincolnshire dealers do not give any of those rich greasy pellets
of barley meal and hot liquor, which always spoil the flavour, to their
geese, as they well know that oats is the best feeding for them; barley,
besides being more expensive, renders the flesh loose and insipid, and
rather _chickeny_ in flavour.Every point of economy on this subject is matter of great moment, on the
vast scale pursued by Mr Clarke, who pays seven hundred pounds a-year
for the mere conveyance of his birds to the London market; a fact which
gives a tolerable notion of the great extent of capital employed in this
business, the extent of which is scarcely conceivable by my agricultural
countrymen.Little cost, however, is incurred by those who breed the geese, as the
stock are left to provide for themselves, except in the laying season,
and in feeding the goslings until they are old enough to eat grass or
feed on the stubbles.I have no doubt, however, that the cramp would be
less frequently experienced, if solid food were added to the grass, when
the geese are turned out to graze, although Mr Clarke attributes the
cramp, as well as gout and fever, to too close confinement alone.This
opinion does not correspond with my far more limited observation, which
leads me to believe that the cramp attacks goslings most frequently when
they are at large, and left to shift for themselves on green food alone,
and that of the poorest kind.I should think it good economy to give
them, and the old stagers too, all spare garden vegetables, for loss of
condition is prejudicial to them as well as to other animals.Mr Cobbett
used to fatten his young geese, from June to October, on Swedish turnips,
carrots, white cabbages, or lettuces, with some corn.Swedish turnips no doubt will answer very well, but not so well as
farinaceous potatoes, when immediate profit is the object.The experience
of such an extensive dealer as Mr Clarke is worth volumes of theory
and conjecture as to the mode of feeding, and he decides in favour of
potatoes and oats.The treatment for cramp and fever in Lincolnshire is bleeding--I know not
if it be hazarded in gout--but as it is not successful in the cases of
cramp in one instance out of twenty, it may be pronounced inefficacious.I have had occasion lately to remark in this Journal on the general
disinclination in England to the barbarous custom of plucking geese
alive.In Lincolnshire, however, they do so with the breeding stock three
times in the year, beginning at midsummer, and repeating the operation
twice afterwards, at intervals of six weeks between the operations.The practice is defended on the plea, that if the feathers be matured,
the geese are better for it, while it is of course admitted that the
birds must be injured more or less--according to the handling by the
pluckers--if the feathers be not ripe.But as birds do not moult three
times in the year, I do not understand how it should be correctly said
that the feathers _can_ be ripe on these three occasions.How does nature
suggest the propriety of stripping the feathers so often?Where great
numbers are kept, the loss by allowing the feathers to drop on the ground
would be serious, and on this account alone can even one stripping be
justified.In proof of the general opinion that the goose is extremely long-lived,
we have many recorded facts; among them the following:--“In 1824 there
was a goose living in the possession of Mr Hewson of Glenham, near
Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, which was then upwards of a century old.It
had been throughout that term in the constant possession of Mr Hewson’s
forefathers and himself, and on quitting his farm he would not suffer
it to be sold with his other stock, but made a present of it to the
in-coming tenant, that the venerable fowl might terminate its career on
the spot where its useful life had been spent such a length of days.”

The taste which has long prevailed among gourmands for the liver of a
goose, and has led to the enormous cruelties exercised in order to cause
its enlargement by rendering the bird diseased in that organ through high
and forced feeding in a warm temperature and close confinement, is well
known; but I doubt if many are aware of the influence of _charcoal_ in
producing an unnatural state of the liver.I had read of charcoal being put into a trough of water to sweeten it for
geese when cooped up; but from a passage in a recent work by Liebig it
would appear that the charcoal acts not as a sweetener of the water, but
in another way on the constitution of the goose.I am tempted to give the extract from its novelty:--“The production of
flesh and fat may be artificially increased: all domestic animals, for
example, contain much fat.We give food to animals which increases the
activity of certain organs, and is itself capable of being transformed
into fat.We add to the quantity of food, or we lessen the progress
of respiration and perspiration by preventing motion.The conditions
necessary to effect this purpose in birds are different from those in
quadrupeds; and it is well known that charcoal powder produces such an
excessive growth in the liver of a goose as at length causes the death of
the animal.”

We are much inferior to the English in the art of preparing poultry for
the market; and this is the more to be regretted in the instance of
geese, especially as we can supply potatoes--which I have shown to be
the chief material of their fattening food--at half their cost in many
parts of England.This advantage alone ought to render the friends of our
agricultural poor earnest in promoting the rearing and fattening of geese
in localities favourable for the purpose.The encouragement of our native manufactures is now a general topic of
conversation and interest, and we hope the present excitement of the
public mind on this subject will be productive of permanent good.We also
hope that the encouragement proposed to be given to articles of Irish
manufacture will be extended to the productions of the head as well as to
those of the hands; that the manufacturer of Irish wit and humour will be
deemed worthy of support as well as those of silks, woollens, or felts;
and, that Irishmen shall venture to estimate the value of Irish produce
for themselves, without waiting as heretofore till they get “the London
stamp” upon them, as our play-going people of old times used to do in the
case of the eminent Irish actors.We are indeed greatly inclined to believe that our Irish manufactures
are rising in estimation in England, from the fact which has come to
our knowledge that many thousands of our Belfast hams are sold annually
at the other side of the water as genuine Yorkshire, and also that many
of those Belfast hams with the Yorkshire stamp find their way back into
“Ould Ireland,” and are bought as English by those who would despise
them as Irish.Now, we should like our countrymen not to be gulled in
this way, but depend upon their own judgment in the matter of hams, and
in like manner in the matter of articles of Irish literary manufacture,
without waiting for the London stamp to be put on them.The necessity
for such discrimination and confidence in their own judgment exists
equally in hams and literature.Thus certain English editors approve so
highly of our articles in the Irish Penny Journal, that they copy them
by wholesale, not only without acknowledgment, but actually do us the
favour to father them as their own!As an example of this patronage, we
may refer to a recent number of the Court Gazette, in which its editor
has been entertaining his aristocratic readers with a little piece of
_badinage_ from our Journal, expressly written for us, and entitled “A
short chapter on Bustles,” but which he gives as written for the said
Court Gazette!Now, this is really very considerate and complimentary,
and we of course feel grateful.But, better again, we find our able and
kind friend the editor of the _Monitor_ and _Irishman_, presenting, no
doubt inadvertently, this very article to his Irish readers a few weeks
ago--not even as an Irish article that had got the London stamp upon it,
but as actually one of true British manufacture--the produce of the Court
Gazette.Now, in perfect good humour, we ask our friend, as such we have reason to
consider him, could he not as well have copied this article from our own
Journal, and given us the credit of it--and would it not be worthy of the
consistency and patriotism of the _Irishman_, who writes so ably in the
cause of Irish manufactures, to extend his support, as far as might be
compatible with truth and honesty, to the native literature of Ireland?*       *       *       *       *

was burnt on a pile of wood, which was called 'pyra,' or 'rogus.'According to Servius, it was called by the former name before, and hy
the latter after, it was lighted, but this distinction is not observed
by the Latin writers.]It was in the form of an altar with four equal sides, but it varied in
height and the mode of decoration, according to the circumstances of the
deceased.On the pile the body was placed with the couch on which it had
been carried; and frankincense, ointments, locks of hair, and garlands,
were thrown upon it.Even ornaments, clothes, and dishes of food were
sometimes used for the same purpose.This was done not only by the
family of the deceased, but by such persons as joined the funeral
procession.][Footnote 612: The cruel boar.--Ver.He alludes to the death of

whereas we personify Death as of the masculine gender; the Romans
represented the grim tyrant as being a female.It is a curious fact
that we find Death very rarely represented as a skeleton on the Roman
monuments.The skeleton of a child has, in one instance, been found
represented on one of the tombs of Pompeii.The head of a horse was
one of the most common modes of representing death, as it signified
departure.][Footnote 615: Ismarian Orpheus.--Ver.Apollo and the Muse Calliope
were the parents of Orpheus, who met with a cruel death.See the
beginning of the Eleventh Book of the Metamorphoses.]'Ælinon' was said to have been
the exclamation of Apollo, on the death of his son, the poet Linus.The
word is derived from the Greek, 'di Aivôç,' 'Alas!A certain
poetic measure was called by this name; but we learn from Athenaeus,
that it was not always confined to pathetic subjects.There appear to
have been two persons of the name of Linus.One was a Theban, the son of

the son of an Argive princess, by Apollo, who, according to Statius, was

ancient people of Corcyra, now the isle of Corfu.Tibullus had attended
Messala thither, and falling ill, was unable to accompany his patron on
his return to Rome, on which he addressed to him the First Elegy of his
Third Book, in which he expressed a hope that he might not die among
the Phæacians.Tibullus afterwards
recovered, and died at Rome.When he penned this line, Ovid little
thought that his own bones would one day rest in a much more ignoble
spot than Corcyra, and one much more repulsive to the habits of
civilization.]1 Hie'here seems to be the preferable
reading; alluding to Rome, in contradistinction to Corcyra.][Footnote 626: His tearful eyes.--Ver.He alludes to the custom of
the nearest relative closing the eyes of the dying person.][Footnote 627: The last gifts.--Ver.The perfumes and other

and to weep before my tomb with dishevelled locks.'To this passage Ovid
makes reference in the next two lines.][Footnote 628: Thy first love.--Ver.'Prior;' his former love was
Delia, who was forsaken by him for Nemesis.They are both represented
here as attending his obsequies.Tibullus says, in the First Elegy of
the First Book, addressing Delia:--]

from the present passage, that it was the custom to give the last kiss
when the body was laid on the funeral pile.][Footnote 629: With his failing hand.--Ver.Nemesis here alludes
to the above line, and tells Delia, that she, herself, alone engaged his
affection, as it was she alone who held his hand when he died.][Footnote 630: Learned Catullus.--Ver.Catullus was a Roman poet, a

of Gallus having killed himself, and to his having been suspected
of treason against Augustus, from whom he had received many marks of
kindness Ovid seems to hint, in the Tristia, Book ii.446, that the
fault of Gallus was his having divulged the secrets of Augustus, when
he was in a state o* inebriety.Some writers say, that when Governor of
Egypt, he caused his name and exploits to be inscribed on the Pyramids,
and that this constituted his crime.Others again, suppose that he was
guilty of extortion in Egypt, and that he especially harassed the people
of Thebea with his exactions.Some of the Commentators think that under
the name 'amicus,' Augustus is not here referred to, inasmuch as it
woulc seem to bespeak a familiar acquaintanceship, which is not known
to have existed.Scaliger thinks that it must refer to some
misunderstanding which had taken place between Gallus and Tibullus, in
which the former was accused of having deceived his friend.][Footnote 632: The rites of Ceres--Ver.This festival of Ceres
occurred on the Fifth of the Ides of April, being the 12th day of that
month.White garments, were worn at this
festival, and woollen robes of dark colour were prohibited.The worship
was conducted solely by females, and all intercourse with men was
forbidden, who were not allowed to approach the altars of the Goddess.][Footnote 633: The oaks, the early oracles.--Ver.On the oaks, the
oracles of Dodona, see the Translation of the Metamorphoses, pages 253
and 467.][Footnote 634: Having nurtured Jove.--Ver.See an account of the
education of Jupiter, by the Curetes, in Crete, in the Fourth Book of
the Fasti, L 499, et seq.][Footnote 635: Beheld Jasius.--Ver.Iasius, or Iasion, was,
according to most accounts, the son of Jupiter and Electra, and enjoyed
the favour of Ceres, by whom he was the father of Plutus.According
to the Scholiast on Theocritus, he was the son of Minos, and the Nymph
Phronia.According to Apollodorus, he was struck dead by the bolts of
Jupiter, for offering violence to Ceres.He was also said by some to
be the husband of Cybele.He is supposed to have been a successful
husbandman when agriculture was but little known; which circumstance is
thought to have given rise to the story of his familiarity with Ceres.Ovid repeats this charge against the chastity of Ceres, in the Tristia,
Book ii.[Footnote 636: Proportion of their wheat.--Ver.With less corn than
had been originally sown.][Footnote 637: The law-giving Mims.--Ver.Minos is said to have
been the first who gave laws to the Cretans.][Footnote 638: Late have the horns.--Ver.This figure is derived

would only laugh at him for his folly, and very deservedly.][Footnote 642: As you walked.--Ver.By the use of the word
'spatiantis,' he alludes to her walks under the Porticos of Rome, which
were much frequented as places for exercise, sheltered from the heat.][Footnote 643: The Gods forsworn.--Ver.This forms the subject of
the Third Elegy of the present Book.][Footnote 644: Young mem at banquets.--Ver.See the Fifth Elegy of
the Second Book of the Amores.][Footnote 645: She was not ill.--Ver.When he arrived, he found his
rival in her company.][Footnote 646: I will hate.--Ver.This and the next line are
considered by Heinsius and other Commentators to be spurious.][Footnote 647: She who but lately.--Ver.Commentators are at a
loss to know whether he is here referring to Corinna, or to his other
mistress, to whom he alludes in the Tenth Elegy of the Second Book,
when he confesses that he is in love with two mistresses.If Corinna was
anything more than an ideal personage, it is probable that she is not
meant here, as he made it a point not to discover to the world who was
meant under that name; whereas, the mistress here mentioned has been
recommended to the notice of the Roman youths by his poems.][Footnote 648: Made proclamation.--Ver.He says that, unconsciously,
he has been doing the duties of the 'præco' or 'crier,' in recommending
his mistress to the public.The 'præco,' among the Romans, was employed
in sales by auction, to advertise the time, place, and conditions of
sale, and very probably to recommend and praise the property offered
for sale.These officers also did the duty of the auctioneer, so far
as calling out the biddings, but the property was knocked down by the
'magister auctionum.'The 'præcones' were also employed to keep silence
in the public assemblies, to pronounce the votes of the centuries, to
summon the plaintiff and defendant upon trials, to proclaim the victors
in the public games, to invite the people to attend public funerals,
to recite the laws that were enacted, and, when goods were lost, to cry
them and search for them.The office of a 'præco' was, in the time of
Cicero, looked upon as rather disreputable.][Footnote 649: Thebes.--Ver.He speaks of the Theban war, the
Trojan war, and the exploits of Caesar, as being good subjects for Epic
poetry; but he says that he had neglected them, and had wasted his time
in singing in praise of Corinna.This, however, may be said in reproof
of his general habits of indolence, and not as necessarily implying that
Corinna is the cause of his present complaint.The Roman poet Statius
afterwards chose the Theban war as his subject.][Footnote 650: Poets as witnesses.--Ver.That is, 'to rely
implicitly on the testimony of poets.'The word 'poetas' requires a
semicolon after it, and not a comma.][Footnote 651: The raging dogs.--Ver.He here falls into his usual
mistake of confounding Scylla, the daughter of Nisus, with Scylla, the
Nymph, the rival of Circe, in the affections of Glaucus.33 of the First Epistle of Sabinus, and the Eighth and Fourteenth
Books of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 652: Descendant of Abas.--Ver.In the Fourth Book of the
Metamorphoses he relates the rescue of Andromeda from the sea monster,
by Perseus, the descendant of Abas, and clearly implies that he used
the services of the winged horse Pegasus on that occasion.It has been
suggested by some Commentators, that he here refers to Bellerophon; but
that hero was not a descendant of Abas, and, singularly enough, he is
not on any occasion mentioned or referred to by Ovid.][Footnote 653: Extended Tityus.--Ver.Tityus was a giant, the son
of Jupiter and Elara.Offering violence to Latona, he was pierced by the
darts of Apollo and hurled to the Infernal Regions, where his liver was
doomed to feed a vulture, without being consumed.][Footnote 654: Enceladus.--Ver.He was the son of Titan and Terra,
and joining in the war against the Gods, he was struck by lightning,
and thrown beneath Mount Ætna.See the Pontic Epistles, Book ii.[Footnote 655: The-two-shaped damsels.--Ver.He evidently alludes
to the Sirens, with their two shapes, and not to Circe, as some have
imagined.][Footnote 656: The Ithacan bags.--Ver.Æolus gave Ulysses
favourable wind* sewn up in a leather bag, to aid him in his return to
Ithaca.See tha Metamorphoses, Book xiv.223]

daughter of Pandion, king of Athens, 'Cecropis ales Cc crops having been
the first king of Athens.Her story is told in the Sixth Book of the
Metamorphoses.][Footnote 658: A bird, or into gold.--Ver.He alludes to the
transformation of Jupiter into a swan, a shower of gold, and a bull; in
the cases of Leda, Danaë, and Europa.][Footnote 659: The Theban seed.--Ver.He alludes to the dragon's
teeth sown by Cadmus.See the Third Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 660: Distil amber tears.--Ver.Reference is made to the

of Æneas, which, when set on fire by Turnus, were changed into sea

occasion this refers.Juno is stated to have concealed herself on two
occasions; once before her marriage, when she fled from the pursuit of
Jupiter, who assumed the form of a cuckoo, that he might deceive her;
and again, when, through fear of the giants, the Gods took refuge in
Egypt and Libya.[Footnote 668: As a mark.--Ver.This is similar to the alleged
origin of the custom of throwing sticks at cocks on Shrove Tuesday.The
Saxons being about to rise in rebellion against their Norman oppressors,
the conspiracy is said to have been discovered through the inopportune

in ranks to dismiss," when Mr.Schermerhorn, who, with Miss Carlton and
Jessie, had left the piazza a few minutes before, came forward, saying,
"Have the goodness to wait a moment, Colonel; there is one more ceremony
to go through with."The boys looked at each other in silent curiosity, wondering what could
be coming; when, all at once, the chairs on the piazza huddled back in a
great hurry, to make a lane for a beautiful little figure, which came
tripping from the open door.It was Jessie; but a great change had been made in her appearance.Over
her snowy muslin skirts she had a short classic tunic of red, white, and
blue silk; a wreath of red and white roses and bright blue jonquils
encircled her curls, and in her hand she carried a superb banner.It
was made of dark blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe; on one side was
painted an American eagle, and on the other the words "Dashahed
Zouaves," surrounded with a blaze of glory and gold stars.She advanced
to the edge of the piazza, and in a clear, sweet voice, a little
tremulous, but very distinct, she said:

          "COLONEL AND BRAVE SOLDIERS:

          "I congratulate you, in the name of our friends,
          on the success you have achieved.You have shown
          us to-day what Young America can do; and as a
          testimonial of our high admiration, I present you
          the colors of your regiment!"Take them, as the assurance that our hearts are
          with you; bear them as the symbol of the Cause you
          have enlisted under; and should you fall beneath
          them on the field of battle, I bid you lay down
          your lives cheerfully for the flag of your
          country, and breathe with your last sigh the name
          of the Union!Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and the great tears swelled to his eyes as
he advanced to take the flag which Jessie held toward him.And now our
little Colonel came out bright, sure enough.Perhaps not another member
of the regiment, called upon to make a speech in this way, could have
thought of a word to reply; but Freddy's quick wit supplied him with
the right ideas; and it was with a proud, happy face, and clear voice
that he responded:

          "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

          "I thank you, in the name of my regiment, for the
          honor you have done us.Inspired by your praises,
          proud to belong to the army of the Republic, we
          hope to go on as we have begun.To your kindness
          we owe the distinguishing colors under which we
          march hereafter; and by the Union for which we
          fight, they shall never float over a retreating
          battalion!"the cheers and clapping of hands which followed this little speech!Everybody was looking at Freddy as he stood there, the colors in his
hand, and the bright flush on his cheek, with the greatest admiration.Of course, his parents weren't proud of him; certainly not!But the wonders were not at an end yet; for suddenly the band began
playing a new air, and to this accompaniment, the sweet voice of some
lady unseen, but which sounded to those who knew, wonderfully like Miss
Lucy Carlton's, sang the following patriotic ballad:

          "We will stand by our Flag--let it lead where it will--
          Our hearts and our hopes fondly cling to it still;
          Through battle and danger our Cause must be won--
          Yet forward!still unsullied and bright,
          As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night
          And the standard that guides us forever shall be
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"A handful of living--an army of dead,
          The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;
          What is it--as sad we retreat from the plain
          That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?to our country God-given,
          That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear
          In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;
          Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,
          And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.every star in it glows,
          The terror of traitors!And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,
          'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"As the song ended, there was another tumult of applause; and then the
band struck up a lively quickstep, and the company, with the Zouaves
marching ahead, poured out on the lawn toward the camp, where a
bountiful collation was awaiting them, spread on the regimental table.Two splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented the centre, and all manner
of "goodies," as the children call them, occupied every inch of space on
the sides.At the head of the table Jerry had contrived a canopy from a
large flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie, Colonel Freddy, with the
other officers, and some favored young ladies of their own age, took
their seats.The other children found places around the table, and a
merrier fete champetre never was seen.The band continued to play lively
airs from time to time, and I really can give you my word as an author,
that nobody looked cross for a single minute!Between you and me, little reader, there had been a secret arrangement
among the grown folks interested in the regiment, to get all this up in
such fine style.Every one had contributed something to give the Zouaves
their flag and music, while to Mr.Schermerhorn it fell to supply the
supper; and arrangements had been made and invitations issued since the
beginning of the week.The regiment, certainly, had the credit, however,
of getting up the review, it only having been the idea of their good
friends to have the entertainment and flag presentation.So there was a
pleasant surprise on both sides; and each party in the transaction, was
quite as much astonished and delighted as the other could wish.The long sunset shadows were rapidly stealing over the velvet sward as
the company rose from table, adding a new charm to the beauty of the
scene.Everywhere the grass was dotted with groups of elegant ladies and
gentlemen, and merry children, in light summer dresses and quaintly
pretty uniforms.The little camp, with the stacks of guns down its
centre, the bayonets flashing in the last rays of the sun, was all
crowded and brilliant with happy people; looking into the tents and
admiring their exquisite order, inspecting the bright muskets, and
listening eagerly or good-humoredly, as they happened to be children or
grown people, to the explanations and comments of the Zouaves.And on the little grassy knoll, where the flag staff was planted,
central figure of the scene, stood Colonel Freddy, silent and thoughtful
for the first time to-day, with Jerry beside him.The old man had
scarcely left his side since the boy took the flag; he would permit no
one else to wait upon him at table, and his eyes followed him as he
moved among the gay crowd, with a glance of the utmost pride and
affection.The old volunteer seemed to feel that the heart of a soldier
beat beneath the little dandy ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of the
young Colonel.Suddenly, the boy snatches up again the regimental
colors; the Stars and Stripes, and little Jessie's flag, and shakes
them out to the evening breeze; and as they flash into view and once
more the cheers of the Zouaves greet their colors, he says, with
quivering lip and flashing eye, "Jerry, if God spares me to be a man,
I'll live and die a soldier!"The soft evening light was deepening into night, and the beautiful
planet Venus rising in the west, when the visitors bade adieu to the
camp; the Zouaves were shaken hands with until their wrists fairly
ached; and then they all shook hands with "dear" Jessie, as Charley was
heard to call her before the end of the day, and heard her say in her
soft little voice how sorry she was they must go to-morrow (though she
certainly couldn't have been sorrier than _they_ were), and then the
good people all got into their carriages again, and drove off; waving
their handkerchiefs for good-by as long as the camp could be seen; and
so, with the sound of the last wheels dying away in the distance, ended
the very end of

                                THE GRAND REVIEW.AND now, at last, had come that "day of disaster," when Camp McClellan
must be deserted.The very sun didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,
thought the Zouaves; and it was positively certain that the past five
days, although they had occurred in the middle of summer, were the very
shortest ever known!Eleven o'clock was the hour appointed for the
breaking up of the camp, in order that they might return to the city by
the early afternoon boat."Is it possible we have been here a week?"exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat
down to breakfast."It seems as if we had only come yesterday.""What a jolly time it has been!""I don't want
to go to Newport a bit."To Baltimore--but I don't mean to Secesh!"added Tom, with a little
blush."I have a cousin in the Palmetto Guards at Charleston, and that's
one too many rebels in the family."cried George Chadwick; "the Pringles are a first rate
family; the rest of you are loyal enough, I'm sure!"and George gave
Tom such a slap on the back, in token of his good will, that it quite
brought the tears into his eyes.When breakfast was over, the Zouaves repaired to their tents, and
proceeded to pack their clothes away out of the lockers.They were not
very scientific packers, and, in fact, the usual mode of doing the
business was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy into their valises, and
then jump on them until they consented to come together and be locked.Presently Jerry came trotting down with a donkey cart used on the farm,
and under his directions the boys folded their blankets neatly up, and
placed them in the vehicle, which then drove off with its load, leaving
them to get out and pile together the other furnishings of the tents;
for, of course, as soldiers, they were expected to wind up their own
affairs, and we all know that boys will do considerable _hard work_ when
it comes in the form of _play_.Just as the cart, with its vicious
little wrong-headed steed, had tugged, and jerked, and worried itself
out of sight, a light basket carriage, drawn by two dashing black
Canadian ponies, drew up opposite the camp, and the reins were let fall
by a young lady in a saucy "pork pie" straw hat, who was driving--no
other than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside her.The boys eagerly
surrounded the little carriage, and Miss Carlton said, laughing, "Jessie
begged so hard for a last look at the camp, that I had to bring her."Really," repeated Freddy; "but I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie, just
in time to see us off.""You know soldiers take themselves away houses and all," said George;
"you will see the tents come down with a run presently."As he spoke, the donkey
cart rattled up, and Jerry, touching his cap to the ladies, got out, and
prepared to superintend the downfall of the tents.By his directions,
two of the Zouaves went to each tent, and pulled the stakes first from
one corner, then the other; then they grasped firmly the pole which
supported the centre, and when the sergeant ejaculated "Now!"the tents slid smoothly to the ground all at the same moment,
just as you may have made a row of blocks fall down by upsetting the
first one.And now came the last ceremony, the hauling down of the flag.shouted Jerry, and instantly a company was
detached, who brought the six little cannon under the flagstaff, and
charged them with the last of the double headers, saved for this
purpose; Freddy stood close to the flagstaff, with the halyards ready in
his hands.and the folds of the flag stream out proudly in the breeze, as it
rapidly descends the halyards, and flutters softly to the greensward.There was perfectly dead silence for a moment; then the voice of Mr.Schermerhorn was heard calling, "Come, boys, are you ready?Jump in,
then, it is time to start for the boat."The boys turned and saw the
carriages which had brought them so merrily to the camp waiting to
convey them once more to the wharf; while a man belonging to the farm
was rapidly piling the regimental luggage into a wagon.With sorrowful faces the Zouaves clustered around the pretty pony
chaise; shaking hands once more with Jessie, and internally vowing to
adore her as long as they lived.Then they got into the carriages, and
old Jerry grasped Freddy's hand with an affectionate "Good-by, my little
Colonel, God bless ye!Old Jerry won't never forget your noble face as
long as he lives."It would have seemed like insulting the old man to
offer him money in return for his loving admiration, but the handsome
gilt-edged Bible that found its way to him soon after the departure of
the regiment, was inscribed with the irregular schoolboy signature of
"Freddy Jourdain, with love to his old friend Jeremiah Pike."As for the regimental standards, they were found to be rather beyond
the capacity of a rockaway crammed full of Zouaves, so Tom insisted on
riding on top of the baggage, that he might have the pleasure of
carrying them all the way.Up he mounted, as brisk as a lamplighter,
with that monkey, Peter, after him, the flags were handed up, and with
three ringing cheers, the vehicles started at a rapid trot, and the
regiment was fairly off.They almost broke their necks leaning back to
see the last of "dear Jessie," until the locusts hid them from sight,
when they relapsed into somewhat dismal silence for full five minutes.As Peter was going on to Niagara with his father, Mr.Schermerhorn
accompanied the regiment to the city, which looked dustier and red
brickier (what a word!)than ever, now that they were fresh from the
lovely green of the country.Schermerhorn's advice, the party
took possession of two empty Fifth avenue stages which happened to be
waiting at the Fulton ferry, and rode slowly up Broadway to Chambers
street, where Peter and his father bid them good-by, and went off to the
depot.As Peter had declined changing his clothes before he left, they
had to travel all the way to Buffalo with our young friend in this
unusual guise; but, as people had become used to seeing soldiers
parading about in uniform, they didn't seem particularly surprised,
whereat Master Peter was rather disappointed.To go back to the Zouaves, however.When the stages turned into Fifth
avenue, they decided to get out; and after forming their ranks in fine
style, they marched up the avenue, on the sidewalk this time, stopping
at the various houses or street corners where they must bid adieu to one
and another of their number, promising to see each other again as soon
as possible.At last only Tom and Freddy were left to go home by themselves.As they
marched along, keeping faultless step, Freddy exclaimed, "I tell you
what, Tom!I mean to ask my father, the minute he comes home, to let me
go to West Point as soon as I leave school!I must be a soldier--I
can't think of anything else!""That's just what I mean to do!"cried Tom, with sparkling eyes; "and,
Fred, if you get promoted before me, promise you will have me in your
regiment, won't you?"answered Freddy; "but you're the oldest, Tom,
and, you know, the oldest gets promoted first; so mind you don't forget
me when you come to your command!"As he spoke, they reached his own home; and our hero, glad after all to
come back to father, mother, and sister, bounded up the steps, and rang
the bell good and _hard_, just to let Joseph know that a personage of
eminence had arrived.As the door opened, he turned gayly round, cap in
hand, saying, "Good-by, Maryland; you've left the regiment, but you'll
never leave the Union!"and the last words he heard Tom say were, "No,
by George, _never_!"*       *       *       *       *

And now, dear little readers, my boy friends in particular, the history
of Freddy Jourdain must close.He still lives in New York, and attends
Dr.Larned's school, where he is at the head of all his classes.The Dashahed Zouaves have met very often since the encampment, and had
many a good drill in their room--the large attic floor which Mr.Jourdain allowed them for their special accommodation, and where the
beautiful regimental colors are carefully kept, to be proudly displayed
in every parade of the Zouaves.When he is sixteen, the boy Colonel is to enter West Point Academy, and
learn to be a real soldier; while Tom--poor Tom, who went down to
Baltimore that pleasant July month, promising so faithfully to join
Freddy in the cadet corps, may never see the North again.And in conclusion let me say, that should our country again be in danger
in after years, which God forbid, we may be sure that first in the
field, and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant
young friend,

                                 COLONEL FREDDY.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of "Colonel
Freddy," and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed
and breathless interest.George and Helen couldn't help jumping up off
their seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when
anything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful
story that was seen "before it was printed," and a great many "oh's" and
"ah's" testified to their appreciation of the gallant "Dashahed
Zouaves."They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true
story of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had
been read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang
up once more, exclaiming; "Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,
mayn't I recruit a regiment and camp out too?"cried his sister; "I wish I had been Jessie; what a
pity it wasn't all true!""And what if I should tell you," said their mother, laughing, "that a
little bird has whispered in my ear that 'Colonel Freddy' was
wonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?""Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!"The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more
questions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time
they paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg
her to let them drive over to Mr.R----'s place, and find out all about
it.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at
last one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more
stories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,
which looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; "Aunt Fanny's
daughter hasn't forgotten us, after all!"and dressing himself in a
double quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,
forgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of
lightning and began pummelling on his sister's door with both fists;
shouting, "Come, get up!here's another Sock story for
us!"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen's
stockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to
their places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the
wrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the
whole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored
maxim, "The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;" George, meanwhile,
performing a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his
father opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down
stairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to
examine this second instalment of the Sock stories.They found it was
again a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read
"GERMAN SOCKS.""These must be more stories like that
dear 'Little White Angel.'"And so they proved to be; for, on their mother's commencing to read the
first story, it was found to be called, "God's Pensioners;" and
commenced, "It was a cold--" but stop!This book was to be devoted
to "Colonel Freddy;" but if you will only go to Mr.Leavitt's, the
publishers, you will there discover what was the rest of the second Sock
Stories.*       *       *       *       *

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Red, White, Blue Socks.Why should I go there to a pawnshop?""I guess you know well enough, Caven," said Tom."You bad better
come back to the Hall with us and have a talk with Captain
Putnam."This is--is a--a plot against me,"
stammered the slim youth.cried Dick, and caught Caven by the arm.But
with a jerk the seared boy freed himself and ran down the road at
the top of his speed.Sam and Dick pursued him on their bicycles, while some of the
others came after on foot.Seeing this, Jim Caven took to the
woods just as Dan Baxter had done, and the boys found it
impossible to track him any further."I wonder if he'll come back tonight?"said Dick, as the party
returned to where they had left Seth Dickerson and Tom."I don't think he will," answered Sam."I declare, he must be
almost as bad as the Baxters!"The farm wagon soon reached the Hall, and Dick ushered Seth
Dickerson into Captain Putnam's office.The captain looked
surprised at the unexpected visitor, but listened with deep
concern to all the farmer and the Rover boys had to say."This certainly looks black for Caven," he said at last."I did
not think I had such a bad boy here.And you say he got away from
you?""It is a question if he will come back--providing he is really
guilty.I will have his trunk and bag searched without delay.But if he is guilty how did that ruby stud and the watch come into
Alexander Pop's possession?""He was down on Aleck," replied Tom, who had hobbled in after the
others."And, besides, he thought if Aleck was arrested the
search for the criminal would go no further."It is a sad state of affairs at
the best."The party ascended to the dormitory which Jim Caven occupied with
several smaller boy.His trunk was found locked, but Captain Putnam
took upon himself the responsibility of hunting up a key to fit the
box.Once open the trunk was found to contain, among other things,
a bit of heavy cloth tied with a piece of strong cord.cried the captain, as he undid the
package and brought to light several of the missing watches and
also some of the jewelry."I guess it is a clear case against
Caven, and Pop is innocent.""I wish we could tell Pop of it," put in Dick."I will do what I can for the <DW64>, Rover.I am very sorry
indeed, now, that I suspected him," said Captain Putnam, with a
slow shake of his head.At the bottom of the trunk was a pocketbook containing nearly all
of the money which had been stolen.A footing-up revealed the
fact that two watches and three gold shirt studs were still
missing."And those were pawned in Auburn," said Sam."Just wait and see
if I am not right."A party was organized to hunt for Caven, and the captain himself
went to Auburn that very evening.The hunt for the missing boy
proved unsuccessful, and it may be added here that he never turned
up at Putnam Hall again nor at his home in Middletown, having run
away to the West.When Captain Putnam came back he announced that he had recovered
all but one watch.The various goods and the money were distributed
among their rightful owners, and it must be confessed that a big
sigh of relief went up from the cadets who had suffered.The
single missing timepiece was made good to the boy who had lost it,
by the captain buying a similar watch for the youth.After this several weeks passed without anything of special
interest occurring outside of a stirring baseball match with a
club from Ithaca, which Putnam Hall won by a score of six to
three.In this game Dick made a much-needed home run, thus
covering himself with glory."And they hang together like links of a chain," added Fred."The
friend of one is the friend of all, and the same can be said of an
enemy."One morning a telegraph messenger from Cedarville was seen
approaching the Hall, just as the boys were forming for the
roll-call."Here's a telegram for somebody," said Sam."A message for Richard Rover," announced George Strong, after
receiving it, and handed over the yellow envelope.Wondering what the message could contain and who had sent it, Dick
tore open the envelope and read the brief communication.As his
eyes met the words his head seemed to swim around, so bewildered
was he by what was written there.He
says--but read it for yourselves," and the elder Rover handed
over the message, which ran as follows:

"Have just received a strange message from the sea, supposed to be
written by your father."Oh, I pray Heaven the news
is true!""A strange message from the sea," repeated Dick."Perhaps it's a message that was picked up by some steamer,"
suggested Sam."Anyway, uncle wants us to come home at once.""But of course he wanted all of us to come," put in Tom."Anyway,
four horses couldn't hold me back!""If we hurry up
we can catch the noon boat at Cedarville for Ithaca.""Yes, and the evening train for Oak Run," finished Tom.To tell the truth, that message had fired him
as he had never been fired before.He burst into the captain's
office pell-mell, with Tom and Sam on his heels, to explain the
situation.Ten minutes later--and even this time seemed an age
to the brothers--they were hurrying into their ordinary clothing
and packing, their satchels, while Peleg Snuggers was hitching up
to take them to the landing at Cedarville."Good-by to you, and good luck!"shouted Frank, as they clambered
into the wagon, and many other cadets set up a shout.The Rover boys had turned their backs on dear
old Putnam Hall for a long while to come.CHAPTER XI

THE ROVERS REACH A CONCLUSION


For the three Rover boys the Golden Star could not make the trip
from Cedarville to Ithaca fast enough.They fretted over every
delay, and continually wondered if there was any likelihood of
their missing the train which was to take them to Oak Run, the
nearest railroad station to Valley Brook farm, their uncle's home.But the train was not missed; instead, they had to wait half an
hour for it.During this time they procured dinner, although Dick
felt so strange he could scarcely eat a mouthful."Uncle Randolph doesn't say much," he murmured to Tom."We'll know everything before we go to bed, Dick," answered his
brother."I don't believe Uncle Randolph would telegraph unless
the news was good."They indulged in all sorts of speculation, as the train sped on
its way to Oak Run.When the latter place was reached it was
dark, and they found Jack Ness, the hired man, waiting for them
with the carriage."There, I  knowed it," grinned Jack.Rover calculated that
only Dick would come, but I said we'd have 'em all.""And what is this news of my father?""It's a message as was picked up off the coast of Africky,"
replied Ness.Rover didn't explain very clearly to me.He's
a good deal excited, and so is the missus.""Can it be that father is on his
way home?"Leas'wise, your uncle didn't say
so," concluded the hired man.Never had the horses made better time than they did now, and yet
the boys urged Ness continually to drive faster.Swift River was
soon crossed--that stream where Sam had once had such a stirring
adventure--and they bowled along past the Fox and other farms."There is Uncle Randolph out on the porch to greet us!""I do believe they look
happy, don't you, Tom?""They certainly don't look sad," was the noncommittal answer; and
then the carriage swept up to the horse-block and the three boys
alighted."Well,
perhaps it is just as well so.""We simply couldn't stay behind, uncle,"  said Sam."And we are
dying to know what it all means.""But you must have supper first," put in Aunt Martha, as she gave
one and another a motherly kiss."I know riding on the cars
usually makes Tom tremendously hungry.""Well eat after we have had the news," said Tom."We're dying to
know all, as Sam says.""The news is rather perplexing, to tell the truth," said Randolph
Rover, as he led the way into the library of the spacious home."I hardly know what to make of it.""It came by mail--a bulky letter all the way from Cape Town,
Africa.""No, from a Captain Townsend, who, it seems, commands the clipper
ship Rosabel.came in a shout from all three of the Rover
boys."You had better read the captain's communication first," answered
Randolph Rover."Then you will be more apt to understand the
other.Or shall I read it for the benefit of all?""Yes, yes, you read it, Uncle Randolph," was the answer."The letter is dated at Cape Town, and was written a little over a
month ago.It is addressed to 'Randolph Rover, or to Richard,
Thomas, or Samuel Rover, New York City,' and is further marked
'Highly Important-Do Not Lose or Destroy.'""Do hurry and tell
us, Uncle Randolph."And then his uncle read as follows:

"TO THE ROVER FAMILY, New York:

"I am a stranger to you, but I deem it my duty to write to you on
account of something which occurred on the 12th day of April last,
while my clipper ship Rosabel, bound from Boston, U. S. A., to
Cape Town, Africa, was sailing along the coast of Congo but a few
miles due west from the mouth of the Congo River."Our ship had been sent in by a heavy gale but the wind had gone
down, and we were doing more drifting than sailing to the
southward when the lookout espied a man on a small raft which was
drifting toward us."On coming closer, we discovered that the man was white and that
he looked half starved.We put out a boat and rescued the poor
creature  but he had suffered so much from spear wounds and
starvation that, on being taken on board of our ship, he
immediately relapsed into insensibility, and out of this we failed
to arouse him.He died at sundown, and we failed, even to learn
him name or home address."On searching the dead man's pockets we came across the enclosed
letter, addressed to you, and much soiled from water.As you will
see, it is dated more than a year back and was evidently in the
possession of the man who died for some time.Probably he started
out to deliver it, or to reach some point from which it could be
mailed."I trust that the message becomes the means of rescuing the
Anderson Rover mentioned in the letter, and I will be pleased to
learn if this letter of mine is received.The Rosabel sails from
Cape Town to Brazil as soon as her cargo can be discharged and
another taken on."Very truly yours,

"JOHN V. TOWNSEND, Captain."As Randolph Rover ceased reading there was a brief silence, broken
by Tom."So the man who died held a letter.And what is in that, Uncle
Randolph?""I will read it to you, boys, although that is a difficult matter,
for the writing is uneven and much blurred.On one part of the
sheet there is a blot of blood--the blood, I presume--of the
poor fellow who was trying to deliver the communication."Unfolding the stained document, Randolph Rover bent closer to the
table lamp that he might read the more easily.As for the boys,
they fairly held their breaths, that no spoken word might escape
them."The letter is addressed to me," said the uncle."But the
envelope is, as you can see, very much torn.I will read," and he
did so."NIWILI CAMP, on the Congo,

"July the 18th, 189--."DEAR BROTHER RANDOLPH:

"If, by the goodness of God, this reaches you, I trust that you
will set out without delay to my assistance."I write under great difficulties, as a prisoner, of the Bumwo
tribe of natives, ruled by King Susko."I have discovered the secret of a gold mine here, and the king
will not let me go, fearing that I will tell the outside world of
my discovery and bring the English or French here to slay him and
his followers."I entrust this to the care of an English sailor who is going to
try to make his escape.I cannot go myself, having had my leg
broken by a blow from one of my jailers."I am sick and weak in body, and it may be that I will soon die.Yet I beg of you to do what you can for me.If I die, I trust you
to be a father to my dear boys, Dick, Tom, and Sam, and ask Martha
for me to be a mother to them."The king expects soon to remove to another camp at a place called
Rhunda Konoka (the Water Well).Perhaps he will take me along, or
else he may slay me."All those who were with me are dead excepting several natives who
have joined the Burnwo tribe."Good-by, and do what you can until you are certain that I am
dead."Your loving brother,

"ANDERSON ROVER"

When Randolph Rover ceased reading he saw that there were tears in
the eyes of all of the boys, and that his wife was also crying.His own voice had had to be cleared continually.To all the
letter was like a message from the grave."That is all, my boy--and the letter was written about a year
ago!""But we'll go in search of him!""I thought I would go," answered Randolph Rover, "and I thought,
possibly, that I might take Dick with me.""I could never bear to
be left behind.""And you must take me," interrupted Sam."We always go together,
you know."At this talk Randolph Rover was somewhat taken aback."Why, what would three boys do in the heart of Africa?""I shan't stay behind--you can't
make me!""We have been through lots of adventures, uncle, you know that,"
came from Sam."But the danger, boys--" began the uncle."What danger wouldn't we face for father's sake!""I'd
go through fire and water for him.""You had better let us all go," said Dick."If you don't let Tom and Sam go, why, the chances are they'll--"

"Run away and go anyway," finished Sam."Oh, Uncle Randolph, say we can go; please do!""All-right, boys; as you are bound to have it so, you shall all
go.But don't blame me if the perils are greater than you
anticipate, and if the undertaking costs one or more of you your
lives."OFF FOR AFRICA


It was long after midnight before the conversation in relation to
the proposed trip to Africa came to an end.Rover insisted
that the boys should eat something, and they sat around the table
discussing the viands and the two letters at the same time."Have you any idea where this Niwili Camp is?""It is on the Congo, but how far froth the mouth of that stream is
a question, lad.Probably we can learn all about it when we reach
Boma, the capital of the Congo Free State.""The Congo is a pretty big stream, isn't it?"At its mouth it is about ten miles wide, and
it is from twelve to fourteen hundred miles long.Stanley traced
its course after an expedition in which he fought over thirty
battles with the natives."The natives that live close to the
ocean are peaceable enough, so I have been told.""And how are we going to get there?""I don't suppose
there are any regular steamers running to the Congo."I have written to a shipping firm in New York
for information, and they will probably send word by morning," was
the answer.It can well be imagined that the boys slept but little that night.In the morning they telegraphed to Putnam Hall for their trunks,
and also let Captain Putnam and their chums know how matters
stood.Then began preparations for such a tour as none of them
had ever before anticipated.Word came from New York in the early afternoon mail, and the
information sent was highly satisfactory to Randolph Rover.The
French steamer Republique was in port, loading for Boma and other
African ports, and would set sail on the coming Saturday.The
firm had taken upon itself the responsibility to speak of passage
for Mr."Uncle Randolph, you had better telegraph to
them at once for passage for the four of us."Rover, and the telegram was sent within
the hour.As but little in the way of outfits
could be procured in Oak Run or the adjoining villages, it was
decided that they should go down to New York on Thursday afternoon
and spend all of Friday in purchasing in the metropolis whatever
was needed.The only person who was really sober was Mrs.Rover, for she hated
to see her husband start on such a journey, which was bound to, be
full of grave perils."I am afraid you will never come back," she said, with tears in
her eyes."And if you and Anderson are both dead to me, what will
I do?""I feel certain that
a kind Providence will watch over us and bring us all back in
safety."At last the party was ready to set off.A fond good-by was said,
and away they rattled in the carryall for the railroad station at
Oak Run.shouted Tom, as he waved his cap to his aunt,
who stood beside the gateway."And when we come back may we bring father with us," added Dick,
and Sam muttered an amen.The journey down to New York was without incident, and as the
Rovers had lived in the metropolis for years they felt thoroughly
at home and knew exactly where to go for their outfit and suitable
clothing for use in such a warm country was procured, and in
addition each was armed with a revolver.Rover also purchased
a shot-gun and a rifle, and likewise a number of cheap gold and
silver trinkets."The natives are becoming civilized," he explained."But, for all
that, I am certain a small gift now and then will go a long way
toward making friends."The found that the Republique was a stanch-built steamer of eight
thousand tons burden.Her captain, Jules Cambion, spoke English
quite fluently and soon made them feel at home.He was much
interested in the story Randolph Rover had to tell concerning his
missing brother."'Tis a strange happening, truly," he remarked."I sincerely
trust that your search for him proves successful and that he
returns to the arms of his family unharmed.I have visited it twice, and I know.""I am glad to learn that you have been up the Congo," replied
Randolph Rover."Perhaps during your leisure hours on the trip
you will not mind giving me such information as conics to your
mind.""I will tell you all I know willingly," answered Captain Cambion.Exactly at noon on Saturday the Republique was ready to sail, and
with a shout from those on the wharf who had come to see the few
passengers off, she sheered away and started down the bay, past
Bedloe Island and the Statue of Liberty.Before night the shore
line had faded from view, and they were standing out boldly into
the Atlantic Ocean."Off for Africa at last," murmured Sam, who had been standing at
the rail watching the last speck of land as it disappeared."What
a big trip this is going to be!""Never mind how big it is, Sam," came from Tom,  "if only it is
successful."The first few days on board were spent in settling themselves.The party had two connecting staterooms, and Mr.Rover and Sam
occupied one, while Dick and Tom had settled themselves in the
other.The passengers were mostly French people, who were going to try
their fortunes in French Congo.There was, however, one
Englishman, a man named Mortimer Blaze, who was bound out simply
for adventure."I'm tired of England, and tired of America too," he explained."I've hunted through the Rocky Mountains and up in Canada, as well
as at home, and now I'm going to try for a lion or a tiger in
Africa.""Perhaps the lion or tiger will try for you," smiled Tom."It will be a pitched battle, that's all," drawled Mortimer Blaze.He was rather a sleepy looking man, but quick to act when the
occasion demanded.The weather was all that could be wished, and during the first
week out the Republique made good progress.On a steamer there
was but little for the boys to do, and they spent all of their
spare time in reading the books on Africa which Captain Cambion
had in his library, and which were printed in English.Often they
persuaded the genial captain to tell them of his adventures in
that far-away country."You have many strange sights before you," he said to them one
day."The strange vegetation, the immense trees, the wonderful
waterfalls, some larger than your own Niagara, and then the odd
people.Some of the natives are little better than dwarfs, while
others are six feet and more in height and as straight as arrows."Did you ever hear of this King Susko?""Yes; I have heard of him several times.He is known as the
Wanderer, because he and his tribe wander from place to place,
making war on the other tribes."The captain knew nothing of Niwili Camp and expressed the opinion
that it had been, like many other camps, only a temporary affair.He said that the best the party could do was to strike straight up
the Congo, along the south shore, and question the different
natives met concerning King Susko's present whereabouts.On the beginning of the second week a storm was encountered which
lasted for three days.At first the wind blew at a lively rate,
and this was followed by thunder and lightning and a regular
deluge of rain, which made all of the boys stay below.The
steamer pitched from side to side and more than one wave broke
over her decks."This is the worse storm I ever saw," remarked Dick, as he held
fast to a chair in the cabin."They won't be able to set any
table for dinner today."came from Sam, with a groan."Who wants any dinner, when a fellow feels as if he was going to
be turned inside out!"So far none of the boys had suffered from
seasickness, but now poor Sam was catching it, and the youngest
Rover felt thoroughly miserable."Never mind, the storm won't last forever," said Dick
sympathetically."Perhaps you had better lie down, Sam.""How can I, with the ship tossing like a cork?I've got to hold
on, same as the rest, and be glad, I suppose, that I am alive,"
and poor Sam looked utterly miserable.It was very close in the cabin, but neither door nor port-hole
could be opened for fear of the water coming in.Dinner was a
farce, to use Tom's way of expressing it, for everything was cold
and had to be eaten out of hand or from a tin cup.Yet what was
served tasted very good to those who were hungry."I believe we'll go to the bottom before we are done," began Sam,
when a loud shout from the deck reached the ears of all of the
Rovers and made Tom and Dick leap to their feet.Above the wind they could hear a yell from a distance, and then
came more cries from the deck, followed by a bump on the side of
the steamer."But I guess it wasn't hard enough to do much damage.""That remains to be seen," answered Dick."Storm or no storm, I'm
gong on deck to learn what it means," and he hurried up the
companionway.CHAPTER XIII

A RESCUE IN MID-OCEAN


Dick found that he could remain on the deck only with the greatest
of difficulty.Several life lines had been stretched around and
he clung to one of these."Struck a small boat," was the answer."It had a <DW52> man in
it.But the captain thinks he may get over
it, with care," and the sailor hurried away.Dick now saw several men approaching, carrying the form of the
rescued one between them.He looked at the unconscious man and
gave a cry of amazement."I know him very well," answered Dick."He used to work at the
military academy where my brothers and I were cadets."And the
boy told Captain Cambion the particulars of Alexander Pop's
disappearance from Putnam Hall."I am glad that I will be able to
tell him that his innocence is established," he concluded."All providing we are able to bring him around to himself, Master
Rover," returned the captain gravely."You think, then, that he is in bad shape?"We will take him below and do all
we can for him."It was no easy matter to transfer Pop to one of the lower
staterooms, but once placed on a soft berth the Rovers did all
they could for him."It is like a romance," said Sam, while Randolph Rover was
administering some medicine to the unconscious man."He's been suffering from starvation," put in Dick."I suppose he
gave that yell we heard with his last breath."All of the party watched over the <DW52> man with tender care,
and feeling that he could be in no better hands the captain left
him entirely in his friends' charge."When he comes to his senses
you can let me know," he said.Dick was watching by Pop's side, and Tom was at the foot of the
berth, when the <DW52> man opened his eyes.As they rested on
first one Rover and then the other he stared in utter astonishment."Am I dreamin', or am I
back to Putnam Hall again?""You are safe on board an ocean
steamer.""An' yo'--whar yo' dun come from?""We are passengers on the steamer," said Tom."You were picked up
several hours ago.""Yes, but--but I can't undersand dis nohow!"persisted the
<DW52> man, and tried to sit up, only to fall back exhausted."Don't try to understand it, Aleck, until you are stronger," said
Dick."Anyt'ing, sah, anyt'ing!Why, I aint had, no reg'lar meal in
most a week!""Glory to Heaben dat I am
sabed!"And then he said no more for quite a long, while.The soup was already at hand, and it was Dick who fed it slowly
and carefully, seeing to it that Pop should have no more than his
enfeebled stomach could take care of, for overfeeding, so Mr.Rover had said, might kill the man.The next day Pop was able to sit up, although still too weak to
stand on his legs.He was continually praising Heaven for his
safety."I dun Vink I was a goner more dan once," he said."I was on de
ocean all alone about a week, I reckon, although I lost time ob
days after I'd been out two or Vree nights."Perhaps you were, Aleck," said Sam."But tell us how you got in
that position.""Dat am de queerest part ob it, Master Rober--de queerest part
of it.I got into de small boat fo' a sleep, and de fust Ving I
knowed I was miles an' miles away from eberyt'ing; yes, sah-miles
an' miles away on de boundless ocean, an' not so much as a fishin'
smack sail in sight.Golly, but wasn't I scared--I reckon I dun
most turn white!"And Aleck rolled his eyes around impressively."You were in a small boat attached to some steamer?"Da had been usin' de small boat fo' surnt'ing, and
left her overboard.""I don't tink I was--but I aint shuah nohow.""De Harrison, from Brooklyn, bound to Cuba.""Did you ship on her after you left Putnam Hall in such a hurry?"I did, cos I didn't want de police to coted me.But, say, as
true as I stand heah--mean sit heah--I aint guilty of stealin'
dem watches an' t'ings, no I aint!""Captain Putnam made a
great mistake when he dun suspect me.""We thought you innocent all
along, Aleck.""T'ank yo' fo' dat, Master Rober--I'se glad to see dat I'se got
one friend--"

"Three friends, Aleck--we all stood up for you," interrupted
Tom."T'ank yo', t'ank yo'!""And we discovered who the real thief was," added Sam."Wot, yo' dun found, dat out!""An' who was de
black-hearted rascal?""Dat cadet wot tried to be funny wid me an' I had to show him his
place?Hol' on--I dun see him comin' from de attic one day.""When he must have put those stolen articles in your trunk," said
Tom."Yes, he was guilty, Captain Putnam was going to have him
arrested, but he got away."Nothing would do for Alexander Pop after this but that the boys
give him the full particulars of the affair, to which he listened
with the closest attention."Ise mighty glad I am cleared," he said."But I'd give a good
deal to face de cap'n--jest to see wot he would say, eh?""He said he was sorry he had suspected you," said Dick."What a big fool dis darkey was to run away!""I wasn't cut out fo' no sailer man.Ise been sick
most ebery day since I left shoah.By de way, whar is dis ship
bound?"Shuah yo' is foolin', Massah Dick?"We and our uncle are bound for the Congo River."Dat's whar my great gran' fadder dun come from--so I
heard my mammy tell, years ago.I don't want to go dar, not me!""I don't see how you are going to help yourself, Aleck.The first
stop this steamer will make will be at Boma on the Congo River.""'Wot am I to do when I gits dar?Perhaps the captain will let you remain
on the Republique."I don't t'ink I could stand dat.An'
what am yo' going to do in Africa?""We are going on a hunt for my father, who has been missing for
years."Again Aleck had to be told the particulars and again he was
tremendously interested.When the boys had finished he sat in
silence for several minutes."I've got it-jest de t'ing!"Foah gen'men like yo' don't want to
go to Africa widout a valet nohow.Let me be de workin' man fe de
crowd.I'll take de job, cheap,--an' glad ob de chance.""Hullo, that's an idea!""Will yo' do it, Massah Dick?""We'll have to speak to my uncle about it first.""Well, yo' put in a good word fo' me.Yo know I always stood by
yo' in de school," pleaded the <DW52> man."I don't want to be
driftin' around jess nowhar, wid nuffin to do, an' no money comin'
in--not but what I'll work cheap, as I dun said I would," he
added hastily.A little later Randolph Rover joined the group and Aleck's
proposition was laid before him.Strange to say he accepted the
<DW52> man's offer immediately, greatly to the wonder of the
boys, and from that minute on Pop be came a member of the
searching party."I will tell you why I did it," explained Randolph Rover to the
boys in private."When we get into the jungle we will need a man
we can trust and one who is used to American ways.Moreover, if
there is any spying to be done among the natives the chances are
that a black man can do it better than a white man.""Uncle Randolph, you've got a long head," remarked Tom."No doubt
Aleck will prove just the fellow desired."And Tom was right, as
later events proved.CHAPTER XIV

A STRANGE MEETING IN BOMA


The storm delayed the passage of the Republique nearly a week, in
a manner that was totally unexpected by the captain.The fierce
waves, running mountain high, wrenched the screw and it was found
next to impossible to repair the accident.Consequently the
steamer had to proceed under a decreased rate of speed.This was tantalizing to the boys, and also to Randolph Rover, for
everyone wished to get ashore, to start up the Congo as early as
possible.But all the chafing in the world could not help
matters, and they were forced to take things as they came.A place was found among the sailors for Aleck, and soon he began
to feel like himself once more.But the sea did not suit the
<DW52> man, and he was as anxious as his masters to reach shore
once more."It's a pity da can't build a mighty bridge over de ocean, an' run
kyars," he said."Perhaps they'll have a bridge some day resting on boats, Aleck,"
answered Tom."But I don't expect to live to see it.""Yo' don't know about dat, chile.Did
yo'gran'fadder expect to ride at de rate ob sixty miles an hour?Did he expect to send a telegram to San Francisco in a couple ob
minutes?Did he eber dream ob talkin' to sumboddy in Chicago froo
a telephone?Did he knew anyt'ing about electric lights, or
movin' pictures, or carriages wot aint got no bosses, but run wid
gasoline or sumfing like dat?I tell yo, Massah Tom, we don't
know wot we is comin' to!""You are quite right, Alexander," said Mr.Rover, who had
overheard the talk.Some
day I expect to grow com and wheat, yes, potatoes and other
vegetables, by electricity," and then Randolph Rover branched off
into a long discourse on scientific farming that almost took away
poor Aleck's breath."He's a most wonderful man, yo' uncle!"whispered the <DW52> man
to Sam afterward."Fust t'ing yo' know he'll be growin' corn in
de com crib already shucked!"On and on over the mighty Atlantic bounded the steamer.One day
was very much like another, excepting that on Sundays there was a
religious service, which nearly everybody attended.The boys had
become quite attached to Mortimer Blaze and listened eagerly to
the many hunting tales he had to tell."I wish you were going with us," said Tom to him."I like your
style, as you Englishman put it.""Thanks, Rover, and I must say I cotton to you, as the Americans
put it," laughed the hunter."Well, perhaps we'll meet in the
interior, who knows?"I am hoping to meet some friends at Boma.The steamer bad now struck the equator, and as it was midsummer
the weather was extremely warm, and the smell of the oozing tar,
pouring from every joint, was sickening."Dis am jest right," he said."I could sleep eall de time,
'ceptin' when de meal gong rings.""When you land,
Alexander, you ought to feel perfectly at home.""Perhaps, sah; but I dun reckon de United States am good enough
for any man, sah, white or.""It's the greatest country on the
globe."It was a clear day a week later when the lookout announced land
dead ahead.It proved to be a point fifteen miles above the mouth
of the Congo, and at once the course was altered to the southward,
and they made the immense mouth of the river before nightfall.Far away dashed the waves against an
immense golden strand, backed up by gigantic forests of tropical
growth and distant mountains veiled in a bluish mist: The river
was so broad that they were scarcely aware that they were entering
its mouth until the captain told them.When night came the lights of Boma could be distinctly seen,
twinkling silently over the bay of the town.They dropped anchor
among a score of other vessels; and the long ocean trip became a
thing of the past."I'm all ready to go ashore," said Tom."My, but won't it feel good to put foot on land again!""The ocean is all well enough, but
a fellow doesn't want too much of it.""And yet I heard one of the French sailors say that he hated the
land," put in Sam."He hadn't set foot on shore for three years.When they reach port he always remains on deck duty until they
leave again."Mortimer Blaze went ashore at once, after bidding all of the party
a hearty good-by."And, anyway,
good luck to you!""Hope you bag all of the lions
and tigers you wish," and so they parted, not to meet again for
many a day.It was decided that the Rovers should not leave the ship until
morning.It can well be imagined that none of the boys slept
soundly that night.All wondered what was before them, and if
they should succeed or fail in their hunt."Dis aint much ob a town," remarked Aleck, as they landed, a
little before noon, in a hot, gentle shower of rain."There is only one New York, as there is but one London," answered
Randolph Rover."Our architecture would never do for such a hot
climate."Along the river front was a long line of squatty warehouses,
backed up by narrow and far from clean streets, where the places
of business were huddled together, and where a good share of the
trading was done on the sidewalk.The population was a very much
mixed one, but of the Europeans the English and French
predominated.The natives were short, fat, and exceedingly greasy
appearing.Hardly a one of them could speak English."I don't see any Americans," remarked Dick."I suppose--"

"There is an American store!"burst out Sam, pointing across the
way.He had discovered a general trading store, the dilapidated
sign of which read:

          SIMON HOOK,

       Dealer in Everything."I'd like to go in
and see Simon Hook.Rover was willing, and they entered the low and dingy-looking
establishment, which was filled with boxes, barrels, and bags of
goods.They found the proprietor sitting in an easy chair, his feet on a
desk, and a pipe in his mouth."That's me," was the answer; but Mr.Hook did not offer to rise,
nor indeed to even shift his position."We saw your sign and as we are Americans we thought we would drop
in," went on Mr."That's right; glad to see you," came from the man in the chair;
but still he did not offer to shift his position."It's a fool's place to come to, sonny.When these goods are sold
I'm going to quit."Simon Hook paused long enough to take an
extra whiff from his pipe."We are on a hunt for a missing man," answered Randolph Rover.His name is Anderson Rover, and he is my
brother."He was a gold hunter from Californy, or somethin' like that.""Went up the Congo four or five years ago--maybe longer?"He had lots of money, and took several guides
and a number of other, natives along.""Have you seen or heard of him since?""Because them as goes up the Congo never, comes back.It's a
fool's trip among those wild people of the interior.Stanley went
up, but look at the big party he took with him and the many fights
he had to get back alive."At this announcement the hearts of the Rover boys fell.I reckon he's either lost in the jungle or
among the mountains, or else the natives have taken care of him.""Did he say anything about the trail he was going to take?""He was going to take the Rumbobo trail, most all of 'em do.""Say, can I sell you any of these
old things of mine cheap?""Glad to see you," and as they left the shopkeeper waved them a
pleasant adieu with his hand."I guess he has grown tired of trying to sell goods," observed
Tom."Perhaps he knows that if folks want the things he has to sell
they are bound to come to him," said Dick."His store seems to
be the only one of its sort around."The hotel for which they were bound was several squares away,
located in something of a park, with pretty flowers and a
fountain.It was a two-story affair, with spacious verandas and
large rooms, and frequented mostly by English and French people.They had just entered the office; and Randolph Rover was writing
his name in the register, when Dick caught sight of somebody in
the reading room that nearly took away his breath.It is Dan Baxter--Dan
Baxter, just as sure as you are born!"CHAPTER XV

CAPTAIN VILLAIRE'S LITTLE PLOT


Dick was right: the boy in the reading-room' was indeed Dan Baxter,
but so changed in appearance that for the minute neither Tom nor
Sam recognized him.In the past Baxter had always been used to fine clothing, which he
had taken care should be in good repair.Now his clothing was
dilapidated and his shoes looked as if they were about ready to
fall apart.More than this, his face was hollow and careworn, and one eye
looked as if it had suffered severe blow of some sort.Altogether
he was most wretched-looking specimen of humanity, and it was a
wonder that he was allowed at the hotel.But the truth of the
matter was that he had told the proprietor a long tale of
sufferings in the interior and of a delayed remittance from home,
and the hotel keeper was keeping him solely on this account."He looks like a regular
tramp!""He's been in hard luck, that's certain," came from Sam."I
wonder how he drifted out here?"While Sam was speaking Dan Baxter raised his eyes from the
newspaper and glanced around.As his gaze fell upon the three
Rover boys he started and the paper fell to the floor, then he got
up and strode toward them."From Putnam Hall, Baxter," answered Dick quietly.Ordinarily Dan Baxter would have retorted that that was none of
Dick's business, but now he was in thoroughly low spirits, and he
answered meekly:

"I've been playing in hard luck.I went down to New York and one
night when I was in a sailors' boarding house I drank more than
was good for me, and when I woke up in the morning I found myself
on a vessel bound for Africa.""You were shanghaied as a sailor?""That's it, and while I was on board the Costelk the captain and
mate treated me worse than a dog.The captain did
that, and when I struck back he put me in irons and fed me nothing
but stale biscuits and water.""No; she was bound for Cape Town, but stopped here for supplies,
and I jumped overboard at night and swam ashore, and here I am,
and sorry for it," and Dan Baxter drew a long breath.The Rovers were astonished at his meek manner.Was this really
the domineering Baxter, who had always insisted on having his own
way, and who had done so many wrong deeds in the past?"You've had a hard time of it, I suppose?said Dick, hardly
knowing how to go on."Hard, Dick, aint no word," came from the former bully of Putnam
Hall."I've run up against the worst luck that anybody could ever
imagine.But I reckon you don't care about that?""Do you think we ought to care, Baxter?""Well, it aint fair to take advantage of a chap when he's down on
his luck," grumbled the former bully."I guess I've learnt my
lesson all right enough.""Do you mean to say you are going to turn over a new leaf?""Yes, if I ever get the chance."Randolph Rover now joined the group, and Dick explained the
situation.Rover questioned Baxter closely and found that he
was without a cent in his pocket and that the hotel keeper had
threatened to put him out if he was not able to pay up inside of
the next twenty-four hours."See here, Baxter, you never were my friend, and you never
deserved any good from me, but I don't like to see a dog suffer,"
said Dick."I'll give you thirty shillings, and that will help
you along a little," and he drew out his purse."And I'll give you the same," came from Tom."But don't forget that what Dick says
is true, nevertheless."Ninety English shillings--about twenty-two dollars of our money--was
more cash than Dan Baxter had seen in some time, his other
money having been spent before he had taken his unexpected ocean
trip, and his eyes brightened up wonderfully."I'll be much obliged to you for the--the loan," he stammered."I'll pay you back some time, remember.""My advice to you is, to take the first ship you can for home.""And what brought you out here--going on a hunt for your
father?""You'll have a big job finding him.I understand the natives of
the Congo are going on the warpath before long.They have had
some difficulty with the settlers.""I guess we'll manage to take care of ourselves," answered Tom,
and then he and his brothers followed their uncle up to the rooms
which had been engaged for them during their stay in the town."He's, down in the mouth, and no mistake," was Tom's comment, when
the boys were left to themselves."I never saw him so humble
before.""Perhaps knocking around has taught him a lesson," said Dick."I
hope he really does turn over a new leaf."Randolph Rover gathered all the
information he could concerning the trail along the Congo, and
also tried to locate Niwili Camp.He likewise purchased several
additions to his outfits from Simon Hook, and engaged the services
of several natives, the leader of whom was a brawny black named
Cujo, a fellow who declared that he knew every foot of the
territory to be covered and who said he was certain that he could
locate King Susko sooner or later."Him bad man," he said soberly."No et him catch you, or you
suffer big lot!"Cujo took to Aleck from the start, and the pair
soon became warm friends.The African inspected their outfits
with interest and offered several suggestions regarding additional
purchases.Three days were spent in Boma, and during that time the Rovers saw
a good deal of Dan Baxter, who, having nothing better to do, hung
around them continually.He remained as meek as before, but our
friends did not know that this was merely the meekness of a savage
cur while under the whip.Baxter was naturally a brute, and
lacked the backbone necessary far genuine reformation."Say, why can't you take me with you?"he asked, on the day that
the Rover expedition was to start out."I'm willing to do my
share of the work and the fighting, and I won't charge you a cent
for my service.""I don't know as my uncle wants anybody along," said Sam, to whom
Baxter addressed his remarks."Well, won't you speak to him about it, Sam?I can't find
anything to do here, and the captains to whom I've applied don't
want me on their ships," pleaded the former bully of Putnam Hall.Sam was easily touched at all times, and he knew that Baxter must
feel lonely and wretched so far from home and without friends or
capital.He at once went to his brothers and his uncle and laid
the big youth's proposition before them."We don't want him," said Dick promptly."I don't believe he would be of any use to us.""I would rather give him some more money just for him to stay
behind," added Tom."Well, I don't like Baxter any more than the others do.But it
seems awfully hard on him.I don't believe he knows how to turn.""We might give him enough money to get back to the United States
with.""I'd rather have you do that, Uncle Randolph," said Dick."I
don't want him with me.""I will have a talk with the misguided boy," was the conclusion
reached by Randolph Rover; but he got no chance to speak to Dan
Baxter until late in the afternoon, and then, to his astonishment,
Baxter's manner had changed entirely, he intimating that he wanted
nothing more to do with them.For in the meantime something which was bound to be of great
importance to the Rovers had occurred.In Boma were a number of
persons of mixed French and native blood who were little better
than the old-time brigands of Italy.They were led by a wicked
wretch who went by the name of Captain Villaire.Villaire had
been watching the Rovers for two days when he noticed the coldness
which seemed to exist between, our friends and Baxter.At once he
threw himself in Baxter's way and began to it pump the youth
regarding the Americans."Zay are going into the interior, you have remarked," he said in
very bad English."Yes, they are well fixed," answered the tall youth."And zay do carry zare money wid zem?""I guess not--at least, not much of it.""Yes, I hate them," muttered Dan, and his eyes shone wickedly."I'm only treating them in a friendly way now because I'm out of
money and must do something."It ees a good head you have--verra good," murmured
Captain Villaire."Do you know, I heara dem talk about you?""De one boy say you should be in ze jail; didn't you robba
somebody.""You lika do somet'ing wid me?"continued the French native,
closing one eye suggestively.He was a close reader of human
nature and had read Baxter's character as if it was an open book."We gitta dem people into trouble--maka big lot of money.""All right--I'll do anything," answered Baxter savagely."So
they said I ought to be in jail, eh?"You helpa me, I helpa you," went on the wily French native.He had his plan all ready, and, after sounding Baxter some more,
revealed what was in his mind, which was simply to follow the
Rovers into the interior and then make them prisoners.Once this
was done, they would hold the prisoners for a handsome ransom."That's a big job," answered the big youth."But I like your
plan, first-rate if you can carry it out.""I have half a dozen of ze
best of killowers-za, nevair fail me.But as you knowa dem you
will have to do ze lettair writing for us, so zat we git ze money
from zare people at home.""Trust me for that," responded Baxter quickly."You do the capturing and I'll make Mrs.Rover or
somebody else pay up handsomely, never fear."And so a compact was formed which was to give the Rovers a good
deal of trouble in the near future.CHAPTER XVI

THE START UP THE CONGO


"It was queer Dan Baxter should act so," said Sam to his uncle,
when Mr.Rover came back from his interview with the bully."I
thought he wanted to, go the worst way.""He acted as if he had struck something else," answered Randolph
Rover."He didn't even want the money I offered.Perhaps he has
received a remittance from home.""His father is still in
jail.""Perhaps he got Mumps to send it to him," said Sam."But I
forgot, Mumps is away."There was no time to discuss the situation further, for they were
to start early on the following morning, and there were yet a
dozen small matters which must be given attention.All were busy,
and it was not until after eleven that evening that they turned
in.The day for the departure from Boma dawned bright and clear, and
Cujo appeared with his assistants while they were still eating
breakfast."Werry good day for um journey," he said, with a grin."Make good
many miles if nothing go wrong.""You can't do any too well for me," answered Dick."I hope our
expedition into the interior is both short and successful."At first they had thought to go
on horseback; but this was abandoned by the advice of the native,
who declared that horses would prove more of a drag than a help in
many places."Horse canno' climb tree bridge," he explained."No climb high
rock, no go around bad hill.We go on foot an' make better time."The town was soon left behind and they struck a highway which for
several miles afforded easy traveling.On all sides were dense
groves of tropical growth, palms, mangoes, and the like, with
enormous vines festooned from one tree to the next.Underneath
were a great variety, of ferns and mosses, the homes of countless
insects and small animals.The ground was black and wherever
turned up gave forth a sickly odor of decayed vegetation."That is regular fever territory," explained Randolph Rover."Boys, do not sleep on the ground if you can possibly avoid it.I
sincerely trust that none of us take the tropical fever.""If I feel it coming on I'll take a good dose of quinine,"
declared Tom.Fortunately they had brought along a good supply of that valuable
drug.On one side
of the highway was the broad river, which glinted like molten lead
in the sunshine.They could not travel very close to its bank,
for here the ground was uncertain.Once Sam left the highway to
get a better view of the stream, and, before Cujo noticed it,
found himself up to his knees in a muck which stuck to him like so
much glue.roared the youngest Rover, and all of the party
turned, to behold him waving his hand frantically toward them.exclaimed Aleck, and started to go
to Sam's assistance, when Cujo called him back."Must be werry careful," said the native."Ground bad over
dare--lose life if urn don't have a care.And he
approached Sam by a circuitous route over the tufts of grass
which grew like so many dots amid the swamp.Soon he was close
enough to throw the youth the end of a rope he carried.The pull
that, followed nearly took Sam's arms out by the sockets; but the
boy was saved, to return to the others of the party with an
experience which was destined to be very useful to him in, the
future."It will teach me to be careful of where I am going after this,"
he declared."Why, that bog looked almost as safe as the ground
over here!""Tropical places are all full of just such treacherous swamps,"
returned Randolph Rover."It will be wise for all of us to
remember that we are now in a strange territory and that we must
have our eyes and ears wide open."At half-past eleven they came to a halt for dinner.The sun was
now almost overhead, and they were glad enough to seek the shelter
of a number of palms standing in front of a--native hostelry."We will rest here until two o'clock," said Mr."It is all
out of the question to travel in the heat of the day, as we did
yesterday, in such a climate as this.They found the hostelry presided over by a short, fat native who
scarcely spoke a word of English.But he could speak French, and
Mr.Rover spoke to him in that language, while Cujo carried on a
talk in the native tongue.The midday repast was cooked over a
fire built between several stones.The boys watched the cooking
process with interest and were surprised to find, when it came to
eating, that the food prepared tasted so good.They had antelope
steak and a generous supply of native bread, and pure cocoa, which
Tom declared as good as chocolate.After the meal they took it easy in a number of grass hammocks
stretched beneath the wide spreading palms surrounding the wayside
inn, if such it might be called.Aleck and Cujo fell to smoking
and telling each other stories, while the Rovers dozed away, lulled
to sleep by the warm, gentle breeze which was blowing."I don't wonder the natives are lazy," remarked Dick, when his
uncle aroused him."I rarely slept in the daytime at home, and
here I fell off without half trying.""The climate is very enervating, Dick.That is why this section
of the globe makes little or no progress toward civilization.Energetic men come here, with the best intention in the world of
hustling, as it is termed, but soon their ambition oozes out of
them like--well, like molasses out of a barrel lying on a hot
dock in the sun.he called out, and soon the party was on
its way again.The highway was still broad, but now it was not as even as before,
and here and there they had to leap over just such a treacherous
swamp as had caused Sam so much trouble."It's a good thing we
didn't bring the horses," said Mr."I didn't think so
before, but I do now."The jungle was filled with countless birds, of all sorts, sizes,
and colors.Some of these sang in a fairly tuneful fashion, but
the majority uttered only sounds which were as painful to the
hearing as they were tiresome."The sound is enough to drive a nervous fellow crazy," declared
Tom."It's a good thing nature fixed it so that a man can't grow
up nervous here.""Perhaps those outrageous cries are meant to wake a chap up,"
suggested Dick."I've a good mind to shoot some of the little pests.""You may take a few shots later on and see what you can bring down
for supper," answered his uncle."But just now let us push on as
fast as we can.""Remember we are out here to find father, not
to hunt.""As if I would ever forget that," answered Dick, with a
reproachful glance.They were now traveling a bit of a hill which took them, temporarily,
out of sight of the Congo.Cujo declared this was a short route
and much better to travel than the other.The way was through a
forest of African teak wood, immense trees which seemed to tower
to the very skies."They are as large as the immense trees of California of which you
have all heard," remarked Randolph Rover."It is a very useful
wood, used extensively in ship building.""After all, I think a boat on the Congo would have been better to
use than shoe leather," said Sam, who was beginning to grow tired."No use a boat when come to falls," grinned Cujo.Aleck had been dragging behind, carrying a heavy load, to which
he was unaccustomed.Now he rejoined the others with the
announcement that another party was in their rear."They are on foot, too," he said."Cujo whar you dun t'ink da be
gwine?""To the next settlement, maybe," was Randolph Rover's comment,
and Cujo nodded.They waited a bit for the other party to come up, but it did not,
and, after walking back, Cujo returned with the announcement that
they were nowhere in sight."Perhaps they turned off on a side road," said Tom, and there the
matter was dropped, to be brought to their notice very forcibly
that night.Evening found them at another hostelry, presided over by a
Frenchman who had a giant negress for a wife.The pair were a
crafty looking couple, and did not at all please the Rovers."Perhaps we may as well sleep with one eye open tonight," said
Randolph Rover, upon retiring."We are in a strange country, and
it's good advice to consider every man an enemy until he proves
himself a friend."The hostelry was divided into half a dozen rooms, all on the
ground floor.The Rovers were placed in two adjoining apartments,
while the natives and Aleck were quartered in an addition of
bamboo in the rear."Keep your eyes and ears open, Aleck," whispered Dick, on
separating from the faithful <DW52> man."And if you find
anything wrong let us know at once.""Do you suspect anyt'ing, Massah Rober?"Something in the air seems to tell me that
everything is not as it should be.""Dat Frenchman don't look like no angel, sah," and Aleck shook his
head doubtfully."You're right, Aleck, and his wife is a terror, or else I miss my
guess.""Dat's right, Massah Rober; nebber saw sech sharp eyes.Yes, I'll
look out-fo' my own sake as well as fo' de sake ob Ye and de
rest," concluded Aleck.CHAPTER XVII

THE ATTACK AT THE HOSTELRY


The night was exceptionally cool for that locality; and, utterly
worn out by their tiresome journey, all of the Rovers slept more
soundly than they had anticipated.Dick had scarcely dropped off when he heard a
noise at the doorway, which was covered with a rough grass
curtain."Dat's all right," came in a whisper from Aleck."Is dat yo',
Massah Dick?""I dun discovered somet'ing, sah.""Dat udder party dun come up an' is in de woods back ob dis,
house.""No; dare is a Frenchman wot is talkin' to dah chap wot runs dis
shebang, sah.""Perhaps he wants accommodations," mused Dick."Can't say about dat, sah.But de fellers who come up hab a lot
ob ropes wid 'em."came sleepily from Tom, and presently Randolph
Rover and Sam likewise awoke.In a few words the <DW52> man explained the situation.He had
just finished when the wife of the proprietor of the resort came
up to the doorway."The gentleman is wanted outside by my husband," she said in
broken French.But he says please to step out for a moment."Rover repeated the woman's words to the boys."I tell you something is wrong," declared Dick."But what can be wrong, my lad?""If you go outside I'll go with you, Uncle Randolph.""Well, you can do that if you wish."The pair arose and speedily slipped on the few garments which they
had taken off."Do you think it is as bad as that?"But I'm going to take uncle's advice
and count every man an enemy until he proves himself a friend."Rover and Dick were ready to go out, and they did so,
followed by Aleck and preceded by the native woman.As it was
dark the Rovers easily concealed their weapons in the bosoms of
their coats.They walked past the bamboo addition and to the grove of trees
Aleck had mentioned.There they found the Frenchman in
conversation with Captain Villaire."Very much," answered Villaire in French."And this is one of your nephews?""I believe you are hunting for the young man's father?""He is, then,
alive?""Yes; but a prisoner, and very sick.He heard of your being in
Boma by accident through a native of King Susko's tribe who was
sent to the town for some supplies.I heard the story and I have
been employed to lead you to him, and at once.""But--but this is marvelous," stammered Randolph Rover."I must
say I do not understand it.""It is a very queer turn of affairs, I admit.Rover
must explain to you when you meet.He wishes you to come to him
alone.As well as he was able Randolph Rover explained matters to Dick.In the meantime, however, the youth had been looking around
sharply and had noted several forms gliding back and forth in the
gloom under the trees."Uncle Randolph, I don't believe this man," he said briefly."The
story he tells is too unnatural.""I think so myself, Dick; but still--"

"Why didn't this man come straight to the house to tell us this?"Randolph Rover put the question to Captain Villaire.The
Frenchman scowled deeply and shrugged his shoulders."I had my
reason," he said briefly.Before Randolph Rover could answer there came a shout from behind
several trees.repeated Dick, when of a sudden a half dozen men rushed
at him and Randolph Rover and surrounded the pair.In a twinkle,
before either could use his pistol, he was hurled flat and made a
prisoner."Bind them, men," ordered Villaire sternly."And bind them well,
so that escape is impossible."yelled, out Dick, before those on top
of him could choke him off.And off he sped at top
speed, with three or four of Captain Villaire's party after him.Cujo also went to the house, bewildered by what was going on and
hardly knowing how to turn.Randolph Rover fought desperately and so did Dick.But the two
were no match for the six men who had attacked them, and ere they
knew it the Rovers were close prisoners, with their hands bound
behind them and each with a dirty gag of grass stuffed in his
mouth."Now march, or you will be shot," came in bad English from one of
the Villaire party.And as there seemed nothing better to do they
marched, wondering why they had been attacked and where they were
to be taken.Their arms had been confiscated, so further
resistance was useless.When Dick lagged behind he received a
cruel blow on the back which nearly sent him headlong.A journey of several hours brought the party to a small clearing
overlooking the Congo at a point where the bank was fully fifty
feet above the surface of the stream.Here, in years gone by, a
rough log hut had been built, which the African International
Association had once used as a fort during a war with the natives.The log hut was in a state of decay, but still fit for use and
almost hidden from view by the dense growth of vines which covered
it.The men who had brought Randolph Rover and Dick hither evidently
knew all about the hut, for they proceeded to make themselves at
home without delay.Taking the Rovers into one of the apartments
of the dilapidated building they tied each to the logs of the
walls, one several yards from the other."Now you must wait until Captain Villaire returns," said the
leader of the party in French."He will tell you what it means," grinned the brigand, and walked
away to another part of the hut, which was built in a long,
rambling fashion, and contained a dozen or more divisions."We are in a pickle," remarked Dick dismally."This is hunting
up father with a vengeance."But I would like to know what this
means.""It probably means robbery, for one thing, Uncle Randolph."If I am not mistaken I saw some of these rascals hanging around
the hotel in Boma."They have been watching their chance
to attack us ever since we left the town."Slowly the hours wore away until morning dawned.The positions of
both Dick and his uncle were most uncomfortable ones, and the
youth was ready to groan aloud at the strain put upon his
shoulders through having his arms tied behind him.At last they heard footsteps approaching from the opposite end of
the rambling building.He had scarcely spoken when Captain Villaire appeared, followed
by--Dan Baxter!CHAPTER XVIII

A DEMAND OF IMPORTANCE


Dick could scarcely believe the evidence of his own eyesight as he
gazed at the former bully of Putnam Hall and the Frenchman who
stood beside him."Well, that's a good one, I must
say."He is in with these rascals who have captured us," came quickly
from Dick."This is how you repay our kindness, Baxter?"Didn't I refuse your
offer, made just before you went away?""But you didn't refuse the first money we gave you, Baxter.""We won't talk about that, Dick
Rover.Do you realize that you are absolutely in my power?"It was not you who captured us, Baxter.""Well, it amounts to the same thing, eh, Capitan Villaire?"and
the big boy turned to the French brigand, who nodded."Ve will not speak of zem udders," broke in Captain Villaire."Did Baxter put up this plot against us?"To be sure I did," answered Baxter, who loved to brag just as
much as ever."And before I let you go I'm going to make you pay up dearly for
all that I have suffered.Captain Villaire, have you had them
searched?""Yees, Baxter, but za had not mooch monish wid zem.""Then they left it behind at Binoto's place," was the quick
answer."Now if those others aren't captured--"

"Hush, ve vill not speak of zat," put in the brigand hastily."Tell zeni what I haf tole you."Dan Baxter turned once more to the
prisoners."Do you know why you were brought here?""To be robbed, I presume," answered Randolph Rover."Or that and worse," said Dick significantly,

"I reckon I have a right to all of your money, Dick Rover.""I don't see how you make that out, Baxter.""Years ago your father robbed mine out of the rights to a rich
gold mine in the United States."I claim, and so did my father,
that the mine was ours."The mine was discovered by my fattier, and if
everything had gone right he would have had the income from it."What do you
intend to do with us?""We intend to make money out of you," was the answer, given with a
rude laugh."First you will have to answer a few questions.""Zat ees it," put in Captain Villaire."How mooch morlish you
bring wid you from America?""We didn't bring much," answered Randolph Rover, who began to
smell a mouse."You leave zat in Boma, wid ze bankers, eh?""But you haf von big lettair of credit, not so?""Yes, we have a letter of credit," answered Randolph Rover."But
that won't do you any good, nor the money at the banker's
neither.""Ve see about zat, monsieur.Proceed," and Captain Villaire waved
his hand toward Dan Baxter."This is the situation in a nutshell, to come right down to
business," said the former bully of Putnam Hall coolly."You are
our prisoners, and you can't get away, no matter how hard you try.Captain Villaire and his men, as well as myself, are in this
affair to make money.The question is, what is your liberty worth
to you?""So you intend to work such a game?""Well, I shan't pay you a cent.""Don't be a fool, Dick Rover."Well, I haven't any money, and that ends it."Then you will have to foot the bill," continued Dan Baxter,
turning to Randolph Rover."If you value your liberty you will pay us what we demand.""We demand twenty thousand dollars--ten thousand for the liberty
of each."This demand nearly took away Randolph Rover's breath.You are worth a good deal more than that, Mr.And
I am demanding only what is fair.""Perhaps you'll sing a different tune in a few, days--after your
stomachs get empty," responded Dan Baxter, with a malicious gleam
in his fishy eyes."So you mean to starve us into acceding to your
demands," said Dick."Baxter, I always did put you down as a
first-class rascal.If you keep, on, you'll be more of a one than
your father."In high rage the former bully of Putnam Hall strode forward and
without warning struck the defenseless Dick a heavy blow on the
cheek."That, for your impudence," he snarled."You keep a civil tongue
in your head.If you don't--"  He finished with a shake of his
fist."You had bettair make up your mind to pay ze monish," said Captain
Villaire, after a painful pause."It will be ze easiest way out
of ze situation for you.""Don't you pay a cent, Uncle Randolph," interrupted Dick quickly.Then Baxter hit him again, such a stinging blow that he almost
lost consciousness."He is tied up, otherwise you
would never have the courage to attack him.Baxter, have you no
spirit of fairness at all in your composition?""Don't preach--I won't listen to it!""You
have got to pay that money.If you don't--well, I don't believe
you'll ever reach America alive, that's all."With these words Dan Baxter withdrew, followed by Captain
Villaire.They value their lives too much to
refuse.Just wait until they have suffered the pangs of hunger
and thirst, and you'll see how they change their tune.""You are certain za have ze monish?"It will only be a question of waiting for
the money after they send for it.""Neither will I--if we are safe here.You don't think anybody
will follow us?""Not unless za find ze way up from ze rivair.Za cannot come here
by land, because of ze swamps," answered the Frenchman."And ze
way from ze rivair shall be well guarded from now on," he added.CHAPTER XIX

WHAT HAPPENED TO TOM AND SAM


Let us return to Tom and Sam, at the time they were left alone at
Binoto's hostelry."I wish we had gone with Dick and Uncle Randolph," said Tom, as he
slipped into his coat and shoes."I don't like this thing at
all.""Oh, don't get scared before you are hurt, Tom!""These people out here may be peculiar, but--"

Sam did not finish.A loud call from the woods had reached his
ears, and in alarm he too began to dress, at the same time
reaching for his pistol and the money belt which Randolph Rover
had left behind."I--I guess something is wrong," he went on, after a pause."If
we--"

"Tom!came from Aleck, and in a
second more the <DW64>, burst on their view."Come, if yo' is
dressed!"And
Aleck almost dragged the boy along.The Rover boys could readily surmise that Aleck would not act in
this highly excited manner unless there was good cause for it.Consequently, as Sam said afterward, "They didn't stand on the
order of their going, but just flew."Pell-mell out of the
hostelry they tumbled, and ran up the highway as rapidly as their
nimble limbs would permit.They heard several men coming after them, and heard the command
"Halt!"yelled after them in both French and bad English.But
they did not halt until a sudden tumble on Tom's part made the
others pause in dismay.groaned the fun-loving Rover, and tried to
stand up."We ain't got no time ter lose!"panted Aleck, who was almost
winded."If we stay here we'll be gobbled up--in no time, dat's
shuah!""Let us try to carry Tom," said Sam, and attempted to lift his
brother up."De trees--let us dun hide in, de trees!"went on the <DW64>,
struck by a certain idea.groaned Tom, and then shut his teeth hard
to keep himself from screaming with pain.Together they carried the suffering youth away from the highway to
where there was a thick jungle of trees and tropical vines.The
vines, made convenient ladders by which to get up into the trees,
and soon Sam and Aleck were up and pulling poor Tom after them."Now we must be still," said Aleck, when they were safe for the
time being."Hear dem a-conun' dis way."The three listened and soon made out the footsteps of the
approaching party."But, oh, Aleck, what does it all mean?""It means dat yo' uncle an' Dick am prisoners--took by a lot of
rascals under a tall, Frenchman.""Yes, but I don't understand--"

"No more do I, Massah Sam, but it war best to git out, dat's as
shuah as yo' is born," added the <DW52> man solemnly.Poor Torn was having a wretched time of it with his ankle, which
hurt as badly as ever and had begun to swell.As he steadied
himself on one of the limbs of the tree Sam removed his shoe,
which gave him a little relief.From a distance came a shouting, and they made out through the
trees the gleam of a torch.But soon the sounds died out and the
light disappeared."One thing is certain, I can't walk just yet," said Tom."When I
put my foot down it's like a thousand needles darting through my
leg.""Let us go below and hunt up some water," said Sam; and after
waiting a while longer they descended into the small brush.Aleck
soon found a pool not far distant, and to this they carried Tom,
and after all had had a drink, the swollen ankle was bathed, much
to the sufferer's relief.As soon as the sun was
up Aleck announced that he was going back to the hostelry to see
how the land lay."But don't expose yourself," said Tom."I am certain now that is
a regular robbers' resort, or worse."Aleck was gone the best part of three hours.When he returned he
was accompanied by Cujo.The latter announced that all of the
other natives had fled for parts unknown."The inn is deserted," announced Aleck.Even that <DW52> wife of
the proprietor is gone."And did you find any trace of Dick and my uncle?""We found out where dat struggle took place," answered, Aleck."And Cujo reckons as how he can follow de trail if we don't wait
too long to do it.""Must go soon," put in Cujo for himself."Maybe tomorrow come big storm--den track all washed away.""You can go on, but you'll have to
leave me behind.I couldn't walk a hundred yards for a barrel of
gold.""Oh, we can't think of leaving you behind!""I'll tell you wot--Ise dun carry him, at least fe a spell,"
said Aleck, and so it was arranged.Under the new order of things Cujo insisted on making a scouting
tour first, that he might strike the trail before carrying them
off on a circuitous route, thus tiring Aleck out before the real
tracking began.The African departed, to be gone the best Part of an hour.When
he came back there was a broad grin of satisfaction on his homely
features."Cujo got a chicken," he announced, producing the fowl."And here
am some werry good roots, too.Now va dinner befo' we start out."cried Pop, and began to start up a fire
without delay, while Cujo cleaned the fowl and mashed up the
roots, which, when baked on a hot stone, tasted very much like
sweet potatoes.The meal was enjoyed by all, even Tom eating his
full share in spite of his swollen ankle, which was now gradually
resuming its normal condition.Cujo had found the trail at a distance of an eighth of a mile
above the wayside hostelry."Him don't lead to de ribber dare,"
he said."But I dun think somet'ing of him."asked Tom, from his seat on Aleck's
back."I t'ink he go to de kolobo.""De kolobo old place on ribber-place where de white soldiers shoot
from big fort-house.""But would the authorities allow, them to go
there?""No soldiers dare now--leave kolobo years ago.Well, follow the trail as best you can--and we'll see
what we will see.""And let us get along just as fast as we can," added Sam.On they went through a forest that in spots was so thick they
could scarcely pass.The jungle contained every kind of tropical
growth, including ferns, which were beautiful beyond description,
and tiny vines so wiry that they cut like a knife."But I suppose it doesn't hold a
candle to what is beyond.""Werry bad further on," answered Cujo."See, here am de trail,"
and he pointed it out.Several miles were covered, when they came to a halt in order to
rest and to give Aleck a let up in carrying Tom.The youth now
declared his foot felt much better and hobbled along for some
distance by leaning on Sam's shoulder.Presently they were startled by hearing a cry from a distance.They listened intently, then Cujo held up his hand."Me go an' see about dat," he said."Keep out ob sight, all ob
you!"And he glided into the bushes with the skill and silence of
a snake.Another wait ensued, and Tom improved the time by again bathing
his foot in a pool which was discovered not far from where Cujo
had left them.The water seemed to do much good, and the youth
declared that by the morrow he reckoned he would be able to do a
fair amount of walking if they did not progress too rapidly."I declare they could burn wood night and day for a century and
never miss a stick.""I thought I heard some monkeys chattering a while ago," answered
Sam."I suppose the interior is alive with them.""I dun see a monkey lookin' at us now, from dat tree," observed
Aleck."See dem shinin' eyes back ob de leaves?"He pointed with
his long forefinger, and both, boys gazed in the direction.He started back and the others did the same.And they were none
too soon, for an instant later the leaves were thrust apart and a
serpent's form appeared, swaying slowly to and fro, as if
contemplating a drop upon their very heads!CHAPTER XX

THE FIGHT AT THE OLD FORT


For the instant after the serpent appeared nobody spoke or moved.The waving motion of the reptile was fascinating to the last
degree, as was also that beady stare from its glittering eyes.The stare was fixed upon poor Tom, and having retreated but a few
feet, he now stood as though rooted to the spot.Slowly the form
of the snake was lowered, until only the end of its tail kept it
up on the tree branch.Then the head and neck began to swing back
and forth, in a straight line with Tom's face.The horrible fascination held the poor, boy as by a spell, and he
could do nothing but look at those eyes, which seemed to bum
themselves upon his very brain.Closer and closer, and still
closer, they came to his face, until at last the reptile prepared
to strike.It was Sam's pistol that spoke up, at just the right
instant, and those beady eyes were ruined forever, and the wounded
head twisted in every direction, while the body of the serpent,
dropping from the tree, lashed and dashed hither and thither in
its agony.Then the spell was broken, and Tom let out such a yell
of terror as had never before issued from his lips.came a second shot from Sam's pistol.But the serpent was
moving around too rapidly for a good aim to be taken, and only the
tip of the tail was struck.Then, in a mad, blind fashion, the
snake coiled itself upon Aleck's foot, and began, with
lightning-like rapidity, to encircle the <DW52> man's body.shrieked Aleck, trying to pull the snake off with his
hands.or Ise a dead man, shuah!""Catch him by the neck, Aleck!"ejaculated Tom, and brought out
his own pistol.Watching his chance, he pulled the trigger twice,
sending both bullets straight through the reptile's body.Then
Sam fired again, and the mangled head fell to the ground.But dead or alive the body still encircled Aleck, and the
contraction threatened to cave in the <DW52> man's ribs.went Tom's pistol once more, and now the snake had
evidently had enough of it, for it uncoiled slowly and fell to the
ground in a heap, where it slowly shifted from one spot to another
until life was extinct.But neither the boys nor the <DW52> man
waited to see if it was really dead.Instead, they took to their
heels and kept on running until the locality was left a
considerable distance behind."That was a close shave," said Tom, as he dropped on the ground
and began to nurse his lame ankle once more.but that snake
was enough to give one the nightmare!""Don't say a word," groaned Aleck, who had actually turned pale."I vought shuah I was a goner, I did fo' a fac'!I don't want to
meet no mo' snakes!"The two boys reloaded their pistols with all rapidity, and this
was scarcely accomplished when they heard Cujo calling to them.When told of what had
happened he would not believe the tale until he had gone back to
look at the dead snake."Him big wonder um snake didn't kill
all of yo'!"He had located Captain
Villaire's party at the old fort, and said that several French
brigands were on guard, by the trail leading from the swamp and at
the cliff overlooking the river."I see white boy dare too," he added."Same boy wot yo' give
money to in Boma.""Can it be possible that he is
mixed up in this affair?""I can't understand it at all," returned Tom."But the question
is, now we have tracked the rascals, what is to be done next?"After a long talk it was resolved to get as close to the old fort
as possible.Cujo said they need not hurry, for it would be best
to wait until nightfall before making any demonstration against
their enemies.The African was very angry to think that the other
natives had deserted the party, but this anger availed them
nothing.Four o'clock in the afternoon found them on the edge of the swamp
and not far from the bank of the Congo.Beyond was the cliff,
overgrown in every part with rank vegetation, and the ever-present
vines, which hung down like so many ropes of green."If we want to get up the wall we won't want any scaling ladders,"
remarked Tom grimly."Oh, if only we knew that Dick and Uncle
Randolph were safe!""I'm going to find out pretty soon," replied Sam."I'll tell you
what I think.But I didn't dream of such a thing
being done down here although, I know it is done further north in
Africa among the Moors and Algerians."Cujo now went off on another scout and did not return until the
sun was setting."I can show you a way up de rocks," he said."We can get to the
walls of um fort, as you call um, without being seen."Soon night was upon them, for in the tropics there is rarely any
twilight.Tom now declared himself able to walk once more, and
they moved off silently, like so many shadows, beside the swamp
and then over a fallen palm to where a series of rocks, led up to
the cliff proper.They came to a halt, and through the gloom saw a solitary figure
sitting on a rock.The sentinel held a gun over his knees and was
smoking a cigarette."If he sees us he will give the alarm," whispered Tom."Can't we
capture him without making a noise?""Dat's de talk," returned Aleck."Cujo, let us dun try dat
trick.""Urn boys stay here," he said.And off he crawled through the wet grass, taking a circuitous
route which brought him up on the sentinel's left.As he did so Cujo leaped
from the grass and threw him to the earth.Then a long knife
flashed in the air."No speak, or um diet" came softly; but, the
Frenchman realized that the African meant what he said.he growled, in the language of the African.Cujo let out a low whistle, which the others rightly guessed was a
signal for them to come up.Finding himself surrounded, the
Frenchman gave up his gun and other weapons without a struggle.He could talk no English, so what followed had to be translated by
Cujo."Yes, de man an' boy are dare," explained Cujo, pointing to the
fort."Da chained up, so dis rascal say.De captain ob de band
want heap money to let um go.""Ask him how many of the band there are," asked Sam.But at this question the Frenchman shook his head.Either he did
not know or would not tell.After a consultation the rascal was made to march back to safer
ground.Then he was strapped to a tree and gagged.The straps
were not fastened very tightly, so that the man was sure to gain
his liberty sooner or later."If we didn't come back and he was
too tight he might starve to death," said Tom."Not but wot he deserves to starve," said Aleck, with a scowl at
the crestfallen prisoner.At the foot of the cliff all was as dark and silent as a tomb."We go slow now, or maybe take a big tumble," cautioned Cujo."Perhaps him better if me climb up first," and he began the
dangerous ascent of the cliff by means of the numerous vines
already mentioned.He was halfway up when the others started after him, Sam first,
Tom next, and Aleck bringing up in the rear.Slowly they arose until the surface of the stream was a score or
more of feet below them.Then came the sounds of footsteps from
above and suddenly a torch shone down into their upturned faces.came in English and the Rover boys recognized
Dan Baxter."How came you--"

"Silence, Baxter!I have a pistol and you know I am a good shot.Stand where you an and put both hands over your head."yelled the bully, and flung his torch
straight at Tom.Then he turned and ran for the fort, giving the
alarm at the top of his lungs.The torch struck Tom on the neck, and for the moment the youth was
in danger of losing his hold on the vines and tumbling to the
jagged rocks below.But then the torch slipped away, past Sam and
Aleck, and went hissing into the dark waters of the Congo.By this time Cujo had reached the top of the cliff and was making
after Baxter.Both gained the end of the fort at the same time and
one mighty blow from Cujo's club laid Baxter senseless near the
doorway.The cry came in Dick's voice, and was plainly
heard by Sam and Tom.Then Captain Villaire appeared, and a rough
and tumble battle ensued, which the Rovers well remember to this
day.But Tom was equal to the occasion, and after the first onslaught
he turned, as if summoning help from the cliff."Tell the company to come up here and the other company
can surround the swamp!"Several pistol shots rang out, and the boys saw a Frenchman go
down with a broken arm.Then Captain Villaire shouted: "We have
been betrayed--we must flee!"The cry came in French, and as if
by magic the brigands disappeared into the woods behind the old
fort; and victory was upon the side of our friends.CHAPTER XXI

INTO THE HEART OF AFRICA


"Well, I sincerely trust we have no more such adventures."He was seated on an old bench in
one of the rooms of the fort, binding up a finger which had been
bruised in the fray.It was two hours later, and the fight had
come to an end some time previous.Nobody was seriously hurt,
although Sam, Dick, and Aleck were suffering from several small
wounds.Aleck had had his ear clipped by a bullet from Captain
Villaire's pistol and was thankful that he had not been killed.Baxter, the picture of misery, was a prisoner.The bully's face
was much swollen and one eye was in deep mourning.He sat huddled
up in a heap in a corner and wondering what punishment would be
dealt out to him."I suppose they'll kill me," he groaned, and it
may be added that he thought he almost deserved that fate."You came just in time," said Dick."Captain Villaire was about
to torture us into writing letters home asking for the money he
wanted as a ransom.Baxter put it into his head that we were very
rich.""Oh, please don't say anything more about it!""I--that Frenchman put up this job all on
his own hook.""I don't believe it," came promptly from Randolph Rover."You met
him, at Boma; you cannot deny it.""So I did; but he didn't say he was going to capture you, and I--"

"We don't care to listen to your falsehoods, Baxter," interrupted
Dick sternly.Cujo had gone off to watch Captain Villaire and his party.He now
came back, bringing word that the brigand had taken a fallen tree
and put out on the Congo and was drifting down the stream along
with several of his companions in crime."Him won't come back," said the tall African."Him had enough of
urn fight."Nevertheless the whole party remained on guard until morning,
their weapons ready for instant use.But no alarm came, and when
day, dawned they soon made sure that they had the entire locality
around the old fort to themselves, the Frenchman with a broken arm
having managed to crawl off and reach his friends.What to do with Dan Baxter was a conundrum."We can't take him with us, and if we leave him behind he will
only be up to more evil," said Dick."We ought to turn him over
to the British authorities.""No, no, don't do that," pleaded the tall youth."Let me go and
I'll promise never to interfere with you again.""Your promises are not worth the breath used in uttering them,"
replied Tom."Baxter, a worse rascal than you could not be
imagined.Why don't you try to turn over a new leaf?""I will--if you'll only give me one more chance," pleaded the
former bully of Putnam Hall.The matter was discussed in private and it was at last decided to
let Baxter go, providing he would, promise to return straight to
the coast."And remember," said Dick, "if we catch you following us again we
will shoot you on sight.""I won't follow--don't be alarmed," was the low answer, and then
Baxter was released and conducted to the road running down to
Boma.He was given the knife he had carried, but the Rovers kept
his pistol, that he might not be able to take a long-range shot at
them.Soon he was out of their sight, not to turn up again for a
long while to come.It was not until the heat of the day had been spent that the
expedition resumed its journey, after, an excellent meal made from
the supplies Captain Villaire's party had left behind in their
hurried flight.Some of the remaining supplies were done up into
bundles by Cujo, to replace those which had been lost when the
natives hired by Randolph Rover had deserted."It's queer we didn't see anything of that man and woman from the
inn," remarked Dick, as they set off."I reckon they got scared
at the very start."They journeyed until long after nightfall, "To make up for lost
time," as Mr.Rover expressed it, and so steadily did Cujo push on
that when a halt was called the boys were glad enough to rest.They had reached a native village called Rowimu.Here Cujo was
well known and he readily procured good accommodations for all
hands.The next week passed without special incident, excepting that one
afternoon the whole party went hunting, bringing down a large
quantity of birds, and several small animals, including an
antelope, which to the boys looked like a Maine deer excepting for
the peculiar formation of its horns.said Tom, when they were
returning to camp from the hunt."Oh, I reckon he is blasting away at game," laughed Sam, and Tom
at once groaned over the attempted joke."Perhaps we will meet him some day--if he's in this territory,"
put in Dick."But just now I am looking for nobody but father.""And so are all of us," said Tom and Sam promptly.They were getting deeper and deeper into the jungle and had to
take good care that they did not become separated.Yet Cujo said
he understood the way perfectly and often proved his words by
mentioning something which they would soon reach, a stream, a
little lake, or a series of rocks with a tiny waterfall."Been ober dis ground many times," said the guide."I suppose this is the ground Stanley covered in his famous
expedition along the Congo," remarked Dick, as they journeyed
along."But who really discovered the country, Uncle Randolph?""That is a difficult question to answer, Dick.The Portuguese,
the Spanish, and the French all claim that honor, along with the
English.I fancy different sections, were discovered by different
nationalities.This Free State, you know, is controlled by half a
dozen nations.""I wonder if the country will ever be thoroughly civilized?""It will take a long while, I am afraid.Many of the tribes in Africa are, you must
remember, without any form of religion whatever, being even worse
than what we call heathens, who worship some sort of a God."And their morality is of the lowest grade in
consequence.They murder and steal whenever the chance offers,
and when they think the little children too much care for them
they pitch them into the rivers for the crocodiles to feed upon.""Well, I reckon at that rate,
civilization can't come too quick, even if it has to advance
behind bayonets and cannon."CHAPTER XXII

A HURRICANE IN THE JUNGLE


On and on went the expedition.In the past many small towns and
villages had been visited where there were more or less white
people; but now they reached a territory where the blacks held
full sway, with--but this was rarely--a Christian missionary
among them.At all of the places which were visited Cujo inquired about King
Susko and his people, and at last learned that the African had
passed to the southeast along the Kassai River, driving before him
several hundred head of cattle which he had picked up here and
there."Him steal dat cattle," explained Cujo, "but him don't say dat
stealin', him say um--um--"

"A tax on the people?""He must be, unless he gives the people some benefit for the tax
they are forced to pay," said Tom.At one of the villages they leaned that there was another
American Party in that territory, one sent out by an Eastern
college to collect specimens of the flora of central Africa.It
was said that the party consisted of an elderly man and half a
dozen young fellows."I wouldn't mind meeting that crowd," said Sam."They might
brighten up things a bit.""Never mind; things will pick up when once we meet King Susko,"
said Dick."But I would like to know where the crowd is from and
who is in it.""It's not likely we would know them if they are from the East,"
said Sam.Two days later the storm which Cujo had predicted for some time
caught them while they were in the midst of an immense forest of
teak and rosewood.It was the middle of the afternoon, yet the
sky became as black as night, while from a distance came the low
rumble of thunder.There was a wind rushing high up in the air,
but as yet this had not come down any further than the treetops.The birds of the jungle took up the alarm and filled the forest
with their discordant cries, and even the monkeys, which were now
numerous, sit up a jabber which would have been highly trying to
the nerves of a nervous person."Yes, we catch um," said Cujo, in reply to Dick's question."Me
look for safe place too stay.""You think the storm will be a heavy one?""Werry heavy, massah; werry heavy," returned Cujo."Come wid me,
all ob you,"  and he set off on a run.All followed as quickly as they could, and soon found themselves
under a high mass of rocks overlooking the Kassai River.They had
hardly gained the shelter when the storm burst over their heads in
all of its wild fury."My, but this beats anything that I ever saw before!"cried Sam,
as the wind began to rush by them with ever-increasing velocity."Him blow big by-me-by," said Cujo with a sober face."The air was full of a moanin' sound," to use Aleck's way of
expressing it.It came from a great distance and caused the
monkeys and birds to set up more of a noise than ever.The trees
were now swaying violently, and presently from a distance came a
crack like that of a big pistol.asked Randolph Rover, and Cujo
nodded."It is a good thing, then, that we got out of the
forest.""Big woods werry dangerous in heap storm like dis," answered the
African.He crouched down between two of the largest rocks and instinctively
the others followed suit.The "moanin" increased until, with a
roar and a rush, a regular tropical hurricane was upon them.The blackness of the atmosphere was filled with flying tree
branches and scattered vines, while the birds, large and small,
swept past like chips on a swiftly flowing river, powerless to
save themselves in those fierce gusts.shouted Randolph Rover; but the roar
of the elements drowned out his voice completely.However, nobody
thought of rising, and the tree limbs and vines passed harmlessly
over their heads.The first rush of wind over, the rain began, to fall, at first in
drops as big as a quarter-dollar and then in a deluge which
speedily converted the hollows among the rocks into deep pools and
soaked everybody to his very skin.Soon the water was up to their
knees and pouring down into the river like a regular cataract."This is a soaker and no mistake," said Sam, during a brief lull
in the downpour."Why, I never saw so much water come down in my
life.""It's a hurricane," answered Randolph Rover, "It may keep on--"

He got no further, for at that instant a blinding flash of
lightning caused everybody to jump in alarm.Then came an
ear-splitting crack of thunder and up the river they saw a
magnificent baobab tree, which had reared its stately head over a
hundred feet high from the ground, come crashing down, split in
twain as by a Titan's ax.The blackened stump was left standing,
and soon--this burst into flames, to blaze away until another
downpour of rain put out the conflagration.murmured Aleck with a shiver."Ise
glad we didn't take no shelter under dat tree."He had been on the point of making some joke
about the storm, but now the fun was knocked completely out of
him.It rained for the rest of the day and all of the night, and for
once all hands felt thoroughly, miserable.Several times they
essayed to start a fire, by which to dry themselves and make
something hot to drink, but each time the rain put out the blaze.What they had to eat was not only cold, but more or less
water-soaked, and it was not until the next noon that they managed to
cook a meal.When at last the sun did come out, however, it shone, so Sam put
it, "with a vengeance."There was not a cloud left, and the
direct rays of the great orb of day caused a rapid evaporation of
the rain, so that the ground seemed to be covered with a sort of
mist.On every side could be seen the effects of the hurricane-broken
trees, washed-out places along the river, and dead birds
and small animals, including countless monkeys.The monkeys made
the boys' hearts ache, especially one big female, that was found
tightly clasping two little baby monkeys to her breast.The storm had swollen the river to such an extent that they were
forced to leave the beaten track Cujo had been pursuing and take
to another trail which reached out to the southward.Here they
passed a small village occupied entirely by <DW64>s, and Cujo
learned from them that King Susko had passed that way but five
days before.He had had no cattle with him, the majority of his
followers having taken another route.It was thought by some of
the natives that King Susko was bound for a mountain known as the
Hakiwaupi--or Ghost-of-Gold."Can that be the mountain
father was searching for when he came to Africa?"Inquiries from Cujo elicited the information that the mountain
mentioned was located about one hundred miles away, in the center
of an immense plain.It was said to be full of gold, but likewise
haunted by the ghost of a departed warrior known to the natives as
Gnu-ho-mumoli--Man-of-the-Gnu-eye."I reckon that ghost story, was started, by somebody who wanted,
to keep the wealth of che mountain to himself," observed Tom."I
don't believe in ghosts, do you, Cujo?"The tall African shrugged his ebony shoulders, "Maybe no ghost--but
if dare is, no want to see 'um," he said laconically.Nevertheless he did not object to leading them in the direction of
the supposedly haunted mountain.So far the natives had been more or less friendly, but now those
that were met said but little to Cujo, while scowls at the whites
were frequent.It was learned that the college party from the
East was in the vicinity."Perhaps they did something to offend the natives," observed
Randolph Rover."As you can see, they are simple and childlike in
their ways, and as quickly offended on one hand as they are
pleased on the other.All of you must be careful in your
treatment of them, otherwise we may get into serious trouble."CHAPTER XXIII

DICK MEETS AN OLD ENEMY


One afternoon Dick found himself alone near the edge of a tiny
lake situated on the southern border of the jungle through which
the party had passed.The others had gone up the lake shore,
leaving him to see what he could catch for supper.He had just hooked a magnificent fish of a reddish-brown color,
when, on looking up, he espied an elderly man gazing at him
intently from a knoll of water-grass a short distance away."Richard Rover, is it--ahem--possible?"came slowly from the
man's thin lips.ejaculated Dick, so surprised that he let the
fish fall into the water again."How on earth did you get out
here?""I presume I might--er--ask that same question," returned the
former teacher of Putnam Hall."Do you imagine I would be fool enough to do that, Mr.No, the Stanhopes and I were content to let you go--so long as
you minded your own business in the future.""Do not grow saucy, boy; I will not stand it.""I am not saucy, as you see fit to term it, Josiah Crabtree.You
know as well as I do that you ought to be in prison this minute
for plotting the abduction of Dora.""I know nothing of the kind, and will not waste words on you.But
if you did not follow me why are you here?""I am here on business, and not ashamed to own it."And you--did you come in search of your missing
father?"It is a long journey for one so
young.""It's a queer place for you to come to.""I am with an exploring party from Yale College.We are studying
the fauna and flora of central Africa--at least, they are doing
so under my guidance.""They must be learning a heap--under you.""Do you mean to say I am not capable of teaching them!"cried
Josiah Crabtree, wrathfully."Well, if I was in their place I would want somebody else besides
the man who was discharged by Captain Putnam and who failed to get
the appointment he wanted at Columbia College because he could not
stand the examination."fumed Crabtree,
coming closer and shaking, his fist in Dick's face."Well, I know something of your lack of ability.""You are doing your best to insult me!""Such an old fraud as you cannot be insulted, Josiah Crabtree.I
read your real character the first time I met you, and you have
never done anything since which has caused me to alter my opinion
of you.You have a small smattering of learning and you can put
on a very wise look when occasion requires.But that is all there
is to it, except that behind it all you are a thorough-paced
scoundrel and only lack a certain courage to do some daring bit of
rascality."This statement of plain truths fairly set Josiah Crabtree to
boiling with rage.He shook his fist in Dick's face again."Don't
dare to talk that way, Rover; don't dare--or--I'll--I'll--"

"What will you do?""Never mind; I'll show you when the proper time comes.""I told you once before that I was not afraid of you--and I am
not afraid of you now.""You did not come to Africa alone, did you?"I tell you that--and it's the
truth--so that you won't try any underhand game on me.""You--you--"  Josiah Crabtree broke off and suddenly grew
nervous."See here, Rover, let us be friends," he said abruptly."Let us drop the past and be friends-at least, so long as we are
so far away from home and in the country of the enemy."Certainly the man's manner would indicate as much."Well, I'm willing to let past matters, drop--just for the
present," he answered, hardly knowing what to say."I wish to pay
all my attention to finding my father.""Exactly, Richard--and--er--you--who is with you?And that black, how is it he came along?""They are a set of rich young students from Yale in their senior
year who engaged me to bring them hither for study
and--er--recreation.You will
not--ahem--say anything about the past to them, will you?"CHAPTER XXIV

JOSIAH CRABTREE MAKES A MOVE


As quick as a flash of lightning Dick saw through Josiah Crabtree's
scheme for, letting matters Of the past drop.The former teacher
of Putnam Hall was afraid the youth would hunt up the college
students from Yale and expose him to them.As a matter of fact, Crabtree was already "on the outs" with two
of the students, and he was afraid that if the truth regarding his
character became known his present position would be lost to him
and he would be cast off to shift for himself."You don't want me to speak to the students under your charge?""Oh, of course you can speak to them, if you wish.But I--ahem--I
would not care to--er--er--"

"To let them know what a rascal you are," finished Dick."Crabtree, let me tell you once for all, that you can expect no
friendship, from me.When I meet those
students I will tell them whatever I see fit."At these words Josiah Crabtree grew as white as a sheet.Then,
setting his teeth, he suddenly recovered.As was perfectly natural, Dick turned to gaze in the direction.As he did so, Crabtree swung a stick that he carried into the air
and brought it down with all force on the youth's head.Dick felt
a terrific pain, saw a million or more dancing lights flash
through his brain--and then he knew no more."I guess I've fixed him," muttered the former teacher of Putnam
Hall grimly.He knelt beside the fallen boy and felt of his
heart."Not dead, but pretty well knocked out.Now what had I
best do with him?"He thought for a moment, then remembered a deep hollow which he
had encountered but a short while before.Gazing around, to make
certain that nobody was watching him, he picked up the unconscious
lad and stalked off with the form, back into the jungle and up a
small hill.At the top there was a split between the rocks and dirt, and into
this he dropped poor Dick, a distance of twenty or more feet.Then he threw down some loose leaves and dead tree branches."Now I reckon I am getting square with those Rovers," he muttered,
as he hurried away.The others of the Rover party wondered why Dick did not join them
when they gathered around the camp-fire that night."He must be done fishing by this time," said Tom."I wonder if
anything has happened to him?""Let us take a walk up de lake an' see," put in Aleck, and the
pair started off without delay.They soon found the spot where Dick had been fishing.His rod and
line lay on the bank, just as he had dropped it upon Josiah
Crabtree's approach.Then, to Tom's astonishment, a
strange voice answered from the woods: "Here I am!"Dat aint Dick," muttered Aleck."Dat's sumbuddy else, Massah
Tom.""So it is," replied Tom, and presently saw a tall and well-built
young man struggling forth from the tall grass of the jungle.demanded the newcomer, as he stalked toward
them."I guess I can ask the same question," laughed Tom."Are you the
Dick who just answered me?"I am looking for my brother Dick, who was fishing
here a while ago.Are you one of that party of college students we
have heard about?""Yes, I'm a college student from Yale."We can't imagine what
has become of my brother Dick," he went on."Perhaps a lion ate him up," answered the Yale student."No, you
needn't smile.He used to be a teacher at the
academy I and my brothers attend."I have thought so
all along, but the others, would hardly believe it.""I am telling the truth, and can prove all I say.But just now I
am anxious about my brother.Crabtree was scared to
death and ran away.Frank Rand and I took shots at the beast, but
I can't say if we hit him.""It would be too bad if Dick dunh fell into dat lion's clutches,"
put in Aleck."I reckon de lion would chaw him up in no time.""Go back and call Cujo," said Tom."He may be able to track my
brother's footsteps."While he was gone Tom told Dick Chester
much concerning himself, and the college student related several
facts in connection with the party to which he belonged."There are six of us students," he said."We were going to have a
professor from Yale with us, but he got sick at the last moment
and we hired Josiah Crabtree.I wish we hadn't done it now, for
he has proved more of a hindrance than a help, and his real
knowledge of fauna and flora could be put in a peanut shell, with
room to spare.""He's a big brag," answered Tom."Take my advice and never trust
him too far--or you may be sorry for it."Presently Aleck came back, with Cujo following.The brawny
African began at once to examine the footprints along the lake
shore.Udder footprints walk away, but not um Massah Dick."Do you think he--fell into the lake?""Perhaps, Massah Tom--or maybe he get into boat.""I don't know of any boats around here--do
you?""No," returned the young man from Yale."But the natives living
in the vicinity may have them.""Perhaps a native dun carry him off," said Aleck."He must be
sumwhar, dat am certain.""Yes, he must be somewhere," repeated Tom sadly.By this time Sam and Randolph Rover were coming up, and also one
of Dick Chester's friends.The college students were introduced
to the others by Tom, and then a general hunt began for Dick,
which lasted until the shades of night had fallen.But poor Dick
was not found, and all wondered greatly what had, become of him.Tom and the others retired at ten o'clock.But not to sleep, for
with Dick missing none of the Rovers could close an eye."We must
find him in the morning," said Sam.CHAPTER XXV

DICK AND THE LION


When poor Dick came to his senses he was lying in a heap on the
decayed leaves at the bottom of the hollow between the rocks.The
stuff Josiah Crabtree had thrown down still lay on top, of him,
and it was a wonder that he had not been smothered.was the first thought which crossed his
confused mind.He tried to sit up, but found this impossible
until he had scattered the dead leaves and tree branches.Even
then he was so bewildered that he hardly knew what to do,
excepting to stare around at his strange surroundings.Slowly the
truth dawned upon him--how Josiah Crabtree had struck him down
on the lake shore."He must have brought me here," he murmured.Although Dick did not know it, he had been at the bottom of the
hollow all evening and all night.The sun was now up once more,
but it was a day later than he imagined.The hollow was damp and full of ants and other insects, and as
soon as he felt able the youth got up.There was a big lump
behind his left ear where the stick had descended, and this hurt
not a little."I'll get square with him some day," he muttered, as he tried to
crawl out of the hollow."He has more courage to play the villain
than I gave him credit for.Sometime I'll face him again, and
then things will be different."It was no easy matter to get out of the hollow.The sides were
steep and slippery, and four times poor Dick tried, only to slip
back to the bottom.He was about to try a fifth time, when a
sound broke upon his ears which caused him great alarm.From only
a short distance away came the muffled roar of a lion.Dick had never heard, this sound out in the open before, but he
had heard it a number of times at the circus and at the menagerie
in Central Park, New York, and he recognized the roar only too
well.I trust he isn't coming this
way!"But he was coming that way, as Dick soon discovered.A few
seconds of silence were followed by another roar which to, the
alarmed youth appeared to come from almost over his head.Then
came a low whine, which was kept up for fully a minute, followed
by another roar.Dick hardly knew what was best--to remain at
the bottom of the hollow or try to escape to some tree at the top
of the opening."If I go up now he may nab me on sight," he
thought dismally."Oh, if only I had my--thank Heaven, I have!"Dick had felt for his pistol before, to find it gone.But now he
spotted the glint of the shiny barrel among the leaves.The
weapon had fallen from his person at the time Crabtree had pitched
him into the hollow.He reached for it, and to his joy found that
it was fully loaded and ready for use.Presently he heard the bushes overhead thrust aside, and then came
a half roar, half whine that made him jump.Looking up, he saw a
lion standing on the edge of the hollow facing him.The monarch of the forest was holding one of his forepaws up and
now he sat down on his haunches to lick the limb.Then he set up
another whine and shook the limb painfully."He has hurt that paw," thought Dick.Yes, he did see, just at that instant, and started back in
astonishment.Then his face took on a fierce look and he gave a
roar which could be heard for miles around.It was the report of Dick's pistol, but the youth was
nervous, and the bullet merely glanced along the lion's body,
doing little or no damage.The beast roared again, then crouched
down and prepared to leap upon the youth.But the wounded forepaw was a hindrance to the lion's movements,
and he began to crawl along the hollow's edge, seeking a better
point from which to make a leap.Then Dick's pistol spoke up a second time.This shot was a far better one, and the bullet passed directly
through the knee-joint of the lion's left forepaw.He was now
wounded in both fore limbs, and set up a roar which seemed to
fairly make the jungle tremble.Twice he started to leap down
into the hollow, but each time retreated to shake one wounded limb
after another into the air with whines of pain and distress.As soon as the great beast reappeared once more Dick continued his
firing.Soon his pistol was empty, but the lion had not been hit
again.In nervous haste the lad started to re-load only to find
that his cartridge box was empty.he yelled at the lion, and threw a stone at the beast.But the lion was now determined to descend into the hollow, and
paused only to calculate a sure leap to the boy's head.But that pause, brief as it was, was fatal to the calculations of
the monarch of the jungle.From his rear came two shots in rapid
succession, each hitting him in a vulnerable portion of his body.He leaped up into the air, rolled over on the edge of the hollow,
and then came down, head first, just grazing Dick's arm, and
landing at the boy's feet, stone dead."And so did I," came from Randolph Rover.cried Dick, with all the strength he could
command.He was shaking like a reed in the wind and all of the
color had deserted his face."I told you that I had heard several
pistol shots."Rover presented themselves at the top of the
hollow, followed by Aleck and Cujo.The latter procured a rope
made of twisted vines, and by this Dick was raised up without much
difficulty.CHAPTER XXVI

THE LAST OF JOSIAH CRABTREE


All listened intently to the story Dick had to tell, and he had
not yet finished when Dick Chester presented himself, having been
attracted to the vicinity by the roars of the lion and the various
pistol and gun shots."This Crabtree must certainly be as bad as you represent," he
said."I will have a talk with him when I get back to our camp.""It won't be necessary for you to talk to him," answered Dick
grimly."If you'll allow me, I'll do the talking."Chester and Cujo descended into the hollow to examine the lion.There was a bullet in his right foreleg which Chester proved had
come from his rifle."He must be the beast Frank Rand and I fired
at from across the lake.Probably he had his home in the hollow
and limped over to it during the night.""In that case you are entitled to your fair share of the meat--if
you wish any," said Randolph Rover with a smile."But I think
the pelt goes to Tom, for he fired the shot that was really
fatal."And that skin did go to Tom, and lies on his parlor floor
at home today."Several of the students from Yale had been out on a long tour the
afternoon before, in the direction, of the mountain, and they had
reported meeting several natives who had seen King Susko.He was
reported to have but half a dozen of his tribe with him, including
a fellow known as Poison Eye."That's a bad enough title for anybody," said Sam with a shudder."I suppose his job is to poison their enemies if they can't
overcome them in regular battle.""Um tell de thruf," put in Cujo."Once de Mimi tribe fight King
Susko, and whip him.Den Susko send Poison Eye to de Mimi camp.Next day all drink-water get bad, an' men, women, an' children die
off like um flies.""And why didn't they slay the poisoner?""Eberybody 'fraid to touch him--'fraid he be poisoned.""I'd run my chances--providing I had a knife or a club,"
muttered Tom."Such rascals are not fit to live."Dick, as can readily be imagined, was hungry, and before the party
started back for the lake, the youth was provided with some food
which Aleck had very thoughtfully carried with him.It was learned that the two parties were encamped not far apart,
and Dick Chester said he would bring his friends to, see them
before the noon hour was passed."I don't believe he will bring Josiah Crabtree," said Tom."I
reckon Crabtree will take good care to keep out of sight."When Chester came over with his friends he said
that the former teacher of Putnam Hall was missing, having left
word that he was going around the lake to look for a certain
species of flower which so far they had been unable to add to
their specimens."But he will have to come back," said the Vale student."He has
no outfit with which to go it alone."Crabtree put in an appearance just before the sun
set over the jungle to the westward.He presented a most woebegone
appearance, having fallen into a muddy swamp on his face."I--I met with an--an unfortunate accident," he said to
Chester."I fell into the--ahem--mud, and it was only with
great difficulty that I managed to--er--to extricate myself.""Josiah Crabtree, you didn't expect to see me here, did you?"said
Dick sternly, as he stepped forward.And then the others of his
party also came out from where they had been hiding in the brush.The former teacher of Putnam Hall started as if confronted by a
ghost."Why--er--where did you come from, Rover?""You know well enough where I came from, Josiah Crabtree," cried
Dick wrathfully."You dropped me into the hollow for dead, didn't
you!""Why, I--er--that--is--" stammered Crabtree; but could
actually go no further."Don't waste words on him, Dick," put in Tom."Give him the
thrashing he deserves.""If we were in America I would
have you locked up.But out here we must take the law into our
own hands.I am going to thrash you to the very best of my
ability, and after that, if I meet you again I'll--I'll--"

"Dun shoot him on sight," suggested Aleck."Chester--Rand--will you not aid me against this--er--savage
young brute?""Don't you call Dick a brute," put in Sam."If there is any brute here it is you, and everyone in our party
will back up what I say."Crabtree, I have nothing to say in this matter," said Dick
Chester."It would seem that your attack on Rover was a most
atrocious one, and out here you will have to take what punishment
comes.""But you will help me, won't you, Rand?"pleaded the former
teacher, nervously."No, I shall stand by Chester," answered Rand."And will you, too, see me humiliated?"asked Crabtree, turning to
the other Yale students."I, the head of your expedition into
equatorial Africa!"Crabtree, we may as well come to an understanding," said one
of the students, a heavyset young man named Sanders."We hired
you to do certain work for us, and we paid you well for that work.Since we left America you have found fault with nearly everything,
and in a good many instances which I need not recall just now you
have not done as you agreed.You are not the learned scientist
you represented yourself to be--instead, if we are to believe
our newly made friends here, you are a pretender, a big sham, and
a brute in the bargain.This being so, we intend to dispense with
your services from this day forth.We will pay you what is coming
to you, give you your share of our outfit, and then you can go
your way and we will go ours.We absolutely want nothing more to
do with you."This long speech on Sanders' part was delivered amid a deathlike
silence.As the student went on, Josiah Crabtree bit his lip
until the blood came.Once his baneful eyes fairly flashed fire
at Sanders and then at Dick Rover, but then they fell to the
ground."And so you--ahem--throw me off," he said, drawing a long
breath.But I demand all that is coming to me.""And a complete outfit, so that I can make my way back to the
coast.""All that is coming to you--no more and no less," said Sanders
firmly."But he shan't go without that thrashing!"cried Dick, and
catching up a long whip he had had Cujo cut for him he leaped upon
Josiah Crabtree and brought down the lash with stinging effect
across the former teacher's face, leaving a livid mark that
Crabtree was doomed to wear to the day of his death.And there is another for the way you treated Stanhope, and
another for what you did to Dora, and one for Tom, and another for
Sam, and another--"

"Oh!shrieked Crabtree, trying
to run away."Don't--I will be cut to pieces!And as the lash came down over his head, neck, and shoulders, he
danced madly around in pain.At last he broke for cover and
disappeared, not to show himself again until morning, when he
called Chester to him, asked for and received, what was coming to
him, and departed, vowing vengeance on the Rovers and all of the
others."He will remember you for that, Dick," said Sam, when the affair
was over."Let him be--I am not afraid of him," responded the elder
brother.CHAPTER XXVII

THE JOURNEY TO THE MOUNTAIN


By noon of the day following the Rover expedition was on its way
to the mountain said to be so rich in gold.The students from
Yale went with them."It's like a romance, this search after your father," said Chester
to Dick.You can rest assured that our
party will do all we can for you.Specimen hunting is all well
enough, but man hunting is far more interesting.""I would like to go on a regular hunt for big game some day," said
Tom.He had already mentioned Mortimer Blaze to the Yale
students."Yes, that's nice--if you are a crack shot, like Sanders.He
can knock the spots from a playing card at a hundred yards.""Maybe he's a Western boy," laughed Sam.His father owns a big cattle ranch there, and Sanders
learned to shoot while rounding up cattle.He's a tip-top
fellow."They had passed over a small plain and were now working along a
series of rough rocks overgrown with scrub brush and creeping
vines full of thorns.The thorns stuck everybody but Cujo, who
knew exactly how to avoid them."Ise dun got scratched in'steen thousand places," groaned Aleck."Dis am worse dan a bramble bush twice ober, by golly!"For two days the united expeditions kept on their way up the
mountain side,  which sloped gradually at its base, the steeper
portion still being several days' journey distant.During these days they shot several wild animals including a
beautiful antelope, while Sam caught a monkey.But the monkey bit
the boy in the shoulder, and Sam was glad enough to get rid of the
mischievous creature.On the afternoon of the second day Cujo, who was slightly in
advance of the others, called a halt."Two men ahead ob us, up um mountain," he said."Cujo Vink one of
dern King Susko."The discovery was talked over for a few minutes, and it was
decided that Cujo should go ahead, accompanied by Randolph Rover
and Dick.The others were to remain on guard for anything which
might turn up.Dick felt his heart beat rapidly as he advanced with his uncle and
the African guide through the tangle of thorns and over the rough
rocks.He felt that by getting closer to King Susko, he was also
getting closer to the mystery which surrounded his father's
disappearance."See, da is gwine up
into a big hole in de side ob de mountain?""Can you make out if it is Susko or not?""Not fo' certain, Massah Dick.But him belong to de Burnwo tribe,
an' de udder man too.""If they are all alone it will be an easy matter to capture them,"
said Randolph Rover."All told, we are twelve to two.""Come on, and we'll soon know something worth knowing, I feel
certain of it."Cujo now asked that he be allowed to proceed alone, to make
certain that no others of the Burnwo tribe were in the vicinity."We must be werry careful," he said."Burnwos kill eberybody wot
da find around here if not dare people.""Evidently they want to keep the whole mountain of gold to
themselves," observed Dick."All right, Cujo, do as you think
best--I know we can rely upon you."After this they proceeded with more care than ever-along a rocky
edge covered with loose stones.To one side was the mountain, to
the other a sheer descent of several hundred feet, and the
footpath was not over a yard wide."A tumble here would be a serious matter," said Randolph Rover."Take good care, Dick, that you don't step on a rolling stone."But the ledge was passed in safety, and in fifteen minutes more
they were close to the opening is the side of the mountain.It
was an irregular hole about ten feet wide and twice as high.The
a rocks overhead stuck out for several yards, and from these hung
numerous vines, forming a sort of Japanese curtain over the
opening.While the two Rovers waited behind a convenient rock, Cujo crawled
forward on his hand and knees into the cave.They waited for ten
minutes, just then it seemed an hour, but he did not reappear."He is taking his time," whispered Dick."Perhaps something has happened to him," returned Randolph Rover."I've had my pistol ready all along," answered the boy, exhibiting
the weapon."That encounter with the lion taught me a lesson.Dick broke off short, for a sound on the rocks above the cave
entrance had reached his ears.Both gazed in the direction, but
could see nothing."I heard a rustling in the bushes up there perhaps, though, it was
only a bird or some small animal.""Neither can I; but I am certain--Out of sight, Uncle Randolph,
quick!"Dick caught his uncle by the arm, and both threw themselves flat
behind the rocks.Scarcely had they gone down than two spears
came whizzing forward, one hitting the rocks and the other sailing
over their heads and burying itself in a tree trunk several yards
away.They caught a glance of two natives on the rocks over them,
but with the launching of the spears the Africans disappeared.CHAPTER XXVIII

KING SUSKO


"My gracious, this is getting at close range!"burst out Dick,
when he could catch his breath again."Uncle Randolph, they meant
to kill us!"Take care that they do not spear
you."No reply came back to this call, which was several times repeated.Then came a crash, as a big stone was hurled down, to split into a
score of pieces on the rock which sheltered them."They mean to dislodge us," said Dick."If they would only show
themselves--"

He stopped, for he had seen one of the Bumwos peering over a mass
of short brush directly over the cave entrance.Taking hasty aim
with his pistol be fired.A yell of pain followed, proving that the African had been hit.But the Bumwo was not seriously wounded, and soon he sent another
stone at them, this time hitting Randolph Rover on the leg.gasped Dick's uncle, and drew up that member with a wry
face."Did he hurt you much, Uncle Randolph?"And now the man
fired, but the bullet flew wide of its mark, for Randolph Rover
had practiced but little with firearms.They now thought it time to retreat, and, watching their chance,
they ran from the rocks to the trees beyond.While they were
exposed another spear was sent after them, cutting its way through
Mr.Rover's hat brim and causing that gentleman to turn as pale as
a sheet."A few inches closer and it would have been my head!"Perhaps we
had better rejoin the others, Dick."The shots had alarmed the others of the expedition, and all were
hurrying along the rocky ledge when Randolph Rover and Dick met
them."If you go ahead
we may be caught in an ambush.The Bumwos have discovered our
presence and mean to kill us if they can!"Suddenly a loud, deep voice broke upon them, coming from the rocks
over the cave entrance."This
country belongs to the Bumwos."I am King Susko, chief of the Bumwos.""Will you come and have a talk with us?"Want the white man to leave," answered the
African chief, talking in fairly good English."We do not wish to quarrel with you, King Susko; but you will find
it best for you if you will grant us an interview," went on
Randolph Rover."The white man must go away from this mountain.I will not talk
with him," replied the African angrily."To rob the Bumwos of their gold.""No; we are looking for a lost man, one who came to this country
years ago and one who was your prisoner--"

"The white man is no longer here--he went home long time ago.""You have him a prisoner, and
unless you deliver him up you shall suffer dearly for it."This threat evidently angered the African chief greatly, for
suddenly a spear was launched at the boy, which pierced Tom's
shoulder.As Tom went down, a shout went up from the rocks, and suddenly a
dozen or more Bumwos appeared, shaking their spears and acting as
if they meant to rush down on the party below without further
warning.CHAPTER XXIX

THE VILLAGE ON THE MOUNTAIN


"Tom is wounded!"He ran to his brother, to find the
blood flowing freely over Tom's shoulder."I--I guess not," answered Tom with a gasp of pain.Then, as
full of pluck as usual, Tom raised his pistol and fired, hitting
one of the Bumwos in the breast and sending him to the rear,
seriously wounded.It was evident that Cujo had been mistaken and that there were far
more of their enemies around the mountain than they had
anticipated.From behind the Rover expedition a cry arose,
telling that more of the natives were coming from that direction."We are being hemmed in," said Dick Chester nervously."No, let us make a stand," came from Rand."I think a concerted
volley from our pistols and guns will check their movements."It was decided to await the closer approach of the Bumwos, and
each of the party improved the next minute in seeing to it that
his weapon was ready for use.Suddenly a blood-curdling yell arose on the sultry air, and the
Bumwos were seen to be approaching from two directions, at right
angles to each other.cried Dick Rover, and began to fire at one
of the approaching forces.The fight that followed was, however, short and full of
consternation to the Africans.One of the parties was led by King
Susko himself, and the chief had covered less than half the
distance to where the Americans stood when a bullet from Tom
Rover's pistol reached him, wounding him in the thigh and causing
him to pitch headlong on the grass.The fall of the leader made the Africans set up a howl of dismay,
and instead of keeping up the fight they gathered around their
leader.Then, as the Americans continued to fire, they picked
King Susko up and ran off with him.A few spears were hurled at
our friends, but the whole battle, to use Sam's way of summing up
afterward, was a regular "two-for-a-cent affair."Soon the Bumwos
were out of sight down the mountain side.The first work of our friends after they had made certain that the
Africans had really retreated, was to attend to Tom's wound and
the bruise Randolph Rover had received from the stone.Fortunately
neither man nor boy was seriously hurt, although Tom carries the
mark of the spear's thrust to this day."But I don't care," said Tom."I hit old King Susko, and that was
worth a good deal, for it stopped the battle.If the fight had
kept on there is no telling how many of us might have been
killed."While the party was deliberating about what to do next, Cujo
reappeared."I go deep into de cabe when foah Bumwos come on me from behind,"
he explained."Da fight an' fight an' knock me down an' tie me wid vines, an'
den run away.But I broke loose from de vines an' cum just as
quick as could run.Werry big cabe dat, an' strange waterfall in
de back.""Let us explore the cave," said Dick."Somebody can remain on
guard outside."Some demurred to this, but the Rover boys could, not be held back,
and on they went, with Aleck with them.Soon Randolph Rover
hobbled after them, leaving Cujo and the college students to
remain on the watch.The cave proved to be a large affair, running all of half a mile
under the mountain.There were numerous holes in the roof,
through which the sun shone down, making the use of torches
unnecessary.To one side was a deep and swiftly flowing stream,
coming from the waterfall Cujo had mentioned, and disappearing
under the rocks near the entrance to the cavern.shouted Dick, as he gazed on the walls of the
cave."You are, Dick; this is a regular cave of gold, and no mistake.No wonder King Susko wanted to keep us away!"It was a fascinating scene to
watch the sparkling sheet as it thundered downward a distance of
fully a hundred feet.At the bottom was a pool where the water
was lashed into a milky foam which went swirling round and round.suddenly cried Sam, and pointed into
the falling water."Oh, Uncle Randolph, did you ever see anything
like it?""There are no such things as ghosts, Sam," replied his uncle."Stand here and look," answered Sam, and his uncle did as
requested.Presently from out of the mist came the form of a man--the
likeness of Randolph Rover himself!"It is nothing but an optical illusion, Sam, such as are produced
by some magicians on the theater stage.The sun comes down
through yonder hole and reflects your image on the wet rock, which
in turn reflects the form on the sheet of water."And that must be the ghost the natives believe in,"
answered Sam.I can tell you I was
startled.""Here is a path leading up past the waterfall," said Dick, who had
been making an investigation."Take care of where you go," warned Randolph Rover."There may be
some nasty pitfall there.""I'll keep my eyes open," responded Dick.He ascended the rocks, followed by Sam, while the others brought
up in the rear.Up over the waterfall was another cave, long and
narrow.There was now but little light from overhead, but far in
the distance could be seen a long, narrow opening, as if the
mountain top had been, by some convulsion of nature, split in
half."We are coming into the outer world again!"For beyond the opening was a small plain, covered with short grass
and surrounded on every side by jagged rocks which arose to the
height of fifty or sixty feet.In the center of the plain were a
number of native huts, of logs thatched with palm.CHAPTER XXX

FINDING THE LONG-LOST


"A village!""There are several women and children," returned Tom, pointing to
one of the huts."I guess the men went away to fight us."Let us investigate, but with
caution."As they advanced, the women and children set up a cry of alarm,
which was quickly taken up in several of the other huts."Go away, white men; don't touch us!"cried a voice in the purest
English.came from the three Rover boys, and they rushed off in
all haste toward the nut from which the welcome cry had proceeded.Anderson Rover was found in the center of the hut, bound fast by a
heavy iron chain to a post set deeply into the ground.His face
was haggard and thin and his beard was all of a foot and a half
long, while his hair fell thickly over his shoulders.He was
dressed in the merest rags, and had evidently suffered much from
starvation and from other cruel treatment."Do I see aright, or
is it only another of those wild dreams that have entered my brain
lately?"burst out Dick, and hugged his parent
around the neck."It's no dream, father; we are really here," put in Tom, as he
caught one of the slender hands, while Sam caught the other.And then he added tenderly: "But
we'll take good care of you, now we have found you."murmured Anderson Rover, as the brother came up.and the tears began to
flow down his cheeks.Many a time I
thought to give up in despair!""We came as soon as we got that message you sent," answered Dick."But that was long after you had sent it.""And is the sailor, Converse, safe?""Too bad--he was the one friend I had here.""And King Susko has kept you a prisoner all this while?""Yes; and he has treated me shamefully in the bargain.He
imagined I knew all of the secrets of this mountain, of a gold
mine of great riches, and he would not let me go; but, instead,
tried to wring the supposed secret from me by torture.""We will settle accounts with him some day," muttered Dick."It's
a pity Tom didn't kill him."The native women and children were looking in at the doorway
curiously, not knowing what to say or do.Turning swiftly, Dick
caught one by the arm."The key to the lock," he demanded, pointing to the lock on the
iron chain which bound Anderson Rover.But the woman shook her head, and pointed off in the distance."King Susko has the key," explained Anderson Rover."You will
have to break the chain,"  And this was at last done, although not
without great difficulty.In the meantime the natives were ordered to prepare a meal for
Anderson Rover and all of the others, and Cujo was called that he
might question the Africans in their own language.The meal was soon forthcoming, the Bumwo women fearing that they
would be slaughtered if they did not comply with the demands of
the whites.To make sure that the food had not been poisoned,
Dick made several of the natives eat portions of each dish."Um know a good deal," he remarked."Cujo was goin' to tell Dick to do dat.""I am glad the women and children are here," said Randolph Rover."We can take them with us when we leave and warn King Susko that
if he attacks us we will kill them.I think he will rather let us
go than see all of the women and children slaughtered."While they ate, Anderson Rover told his story, which is far too
long to insert here.He had found a gold mine further up the
country and also this mountain of gold, but had been unable to do
anything since King Susko had made him and the sailor prisoners.During his captivity he had suffered untold cruelties, but all
this was now forgotten in the joy of the reunion with his brother
and his three sons.It was decided that the party should leave the mountain without
delay, and Cujo told the female natives to get ready to move.At
this they set up a loud protest, but it availed them nothing, and
they soon quieted down when assured that no harm would befall them
if they behaved.CHAPTER XXXI

HOME AGAIN--CONCLUSION


Nightfall found the entire expedition, including the women and
children, on the mountain side below the caves.As the party went
down the mountain a strict watch was kept for the Bumwo warriors,
and just as the sun was setting, they were discovered in camp on
the trail to the northwest."We will send out a flag of truce," said Randolph Rover.This was done, and presently a tall Bumwo under chief came out in
a plain to hold a mujobo, or "law talk."In a few words Cujo explained the situation, stating that they now
held in bondage eighteen women and children, including King
Susko's favorite wife Afgona.If the whites were allowed to pass
through the country unharmed until they, reached the village of
Kwa, where the Kassai River joins the Congo, they would release
all of the women and children at that point and they could go back
to rejoin their husbands and fathers.If, on the other hand, the
expedition was attacked the whites would put all of those in
bondage to instant death.It is not likely that this horrible threat would have been put
into execution.As Dick said when relating the particulars of the
affair afterward."We couldn't have done such a terrible thing,
for it would not have been human."But the threat had the desired
effect, and in the morning King Susko, who was now on a sick bed,
sent word that they should go through unmolested.And go through they did, through jungles and over plains, across
rivers and lakes and treacherous swamps, watching continually for
their enemies, and bringing down many a savage beast that showed
itself.On the return they fell in with Mortimer Blaze, and he,
being a crack shot, added much to the strength of their command.At last Kwa was reached, and here they found themselves under the
protection of several European military organizations.The native
women and children were released, much to their joy, and my
readers can rest assured that these Africans lost no time in
getting back to that portion of the Dark Continent which they
called home.From Kwa to Boma the journey was comparatively easy.At Stanley
Pool they rested for a week, and all in the party felt the better
for it."Some day I will go back and open up the mines I have discovered,"
said Anderson Rover.I want to see my own dear
native land first."Josiah Crabtree had turned up and been
joined by Dan Baxter, and both had left for parts unknown."I hope we never see them again," said Dick, and his brothers said
the same.An American ship was in port, bound for Baltimore, and all of our
party, including the Yale students, succeeded in obtaining passage
on her for home.The trip was a most delightful one, and no days
could have been happier than those which the Rover boys spent
grouped around their lather listening to all he had to tell of the
numerous adventures which had befallen him since he had left home.A long letter was written to Captain Townsend, telling of the
finding of Anderson Rover, and the master of the Rosabel was,
later on, sent a gift of one hundred dollars for his goodness to
the Rovers.Of course Anderson Rover was greatly interested in what his sons
had been doing and was glad to learn that they were progressing so
finely at Putnam Hall."We will let Arnold Baxter drop," he said."He is our enemy, I know; but just now we will let the law take
its course for the rascality he practiced in Albany.""We can afford to let him
drop, seeing how well things have terminated for ourselves.""And how happy we are going to be," chimed in Sam."And how rich--when father settles up that mining claim in the
West," put in Tom.Here I must bring to a finish the story of the Rover boys'
adventures in the jungles of Africa.They had started out to find
their father, and they had found him, and for the time being all
went well.The home-coming of the Rovers was the occasion of a regular
celebration at Valley Brook farm.The neighbors came in from far
and wide and with them several people from the city who in former
years had known Anderson Rover well.It was a time never to be forgotten, and the celebration was kept
up for several days.Captain Putnam was there, and with him came
Frank, Fred, Larry, and several others.The captain apologized
handsomely to Aleck for the way he had treated the <DW52> man."I wish I had been with you," said Fred."You Rover boys are
wonders for getting around."I think we'll go West next," answered Dick."Father wants to
look up his mining interests, you know.We are going to ask him
to take us along."They did go west, and what adventures they had
will be related in a new volume, entitled "The Rover Boys Out West;
or, The Search for a Lost Mine.""But we are coming back to Putnam Hall first," added Tom.I thought of it even in the heart of Africa!""And so did I," put in Sam."I'll tell you, fellows, it's good
enough to roam around, but, after all, there is no place like
home."And with this truthful remark from the youngest Rover, let us
close this volume, kind reader, hoping that all of us may meet
again in the next book of the series, to be entitled, "The Rover
Boys Out West; or, The Search for a Lost Mine."In this story all
of our friends will once more play important parts, and we will
learn what the Baxters, father and son, did toward wresting the
Rover Boys' valuable mining property from them.But for the time
being all went well, and so good-by.The surrender was a fixed fact, and
the rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.Our
men, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations
with the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that
the rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels
seemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,
dissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands
eager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to
eat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with
Colonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender
had taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that
everything had been appropriated before our arrival.Wilmer McLean, in
whose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at
Manassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his
name in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden
harvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories
of these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record
of great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their
heads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the
congratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They
felt they had done their duty, and given the "tottering giant" a blow that
laid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again.For a period of almost ten years the suzerainty of England over the
Transvaal was an unknown quantity.With the exception of several
Government officials, there were hardly any Englishmen in the country,
and no one had the slightest interest in the affairs of the Transvaal
Government.When gold was discovered in the Randt in quantities that
equalled those of the early days of the California gold fields, an
unparalleled influx of Englishmen and foreigners followed, and in
several years the city of Johannesburg had sprung up in the veldt.The opening of hundreds of mines, and the consequent increase in
expenditures, made it necessary for the Transvaal Government to increase
its revenues.Mining laws had to be formulated, new offices had to be
created, hundreds of new officials had to be appointed, and all this
required the expenditure of more money in one year than the Government
had spent in a decade before the opening of the mines.The Government
found itself in a quandary, and it solved the problem of finances as
many a stronger and wealthier government has done.Concessions were granted to dynamite, railway, electric light, electric
railway, water, and many other companies, and these furnished to the
Government the nucleus upon which depended its financial existence.Few
of the concessions were obtained by British subjects, and when the
monopolies took advantage of their opportunities, and raised the price
of dynamite and the rates for carrying freight, the Englishmen, who
owned all the mines, naturally objected.The Boer Government, having
bound itself hand and foot when hard pressed for money, was unable to
compel the concessionaries to reduce their rates.At that period of the Randt's existence the speculators appeared, and
soon thereafter the London Stock Exchange became a factor in the affairs
of the Randt.Where the Stock Exchange leads, the politicians follow,
and they too soon became interested in South African affairs.Then the
treaty of 1883 was found in the Colonial Office archives, and next
appears a demand to the Boer Government that all British residents of
the Transvaal be allowed to vote.The Boers refused to give the
franchise to any applicant unless he first renounced his allegiance to
other countries, and, as the British subjects declined to accede to the
request, the politicians became busily engaged in formulating other
plans whereby England might obtain control of the country.At that inopportune time Jameson's troopers entered the Transvaal
territory and attempted to take forcible possession of the country; but
they were unsuccessful, and only succeeded in directing the world's
sympathy to the Boers.The Jameson raid was practically Cecil J.
Rhodes's first important attempt to add the Transvaal to the list of
South African additions he has made to the British Empire.The result
was especially galling to him, as it was the first time his great
political schemes failed of success.But Rhodes is not the man to weep over disasters.Before the excitement
over the raid had subsided, Rhodes had concocted a plan to inflict a
commercial death upon the Transvaal, and in that manner force it to beg
for the protection of the English flag.He opened Rhodesia, an
adjoining country, for settlement, and by glorifying the country, its
mineral and agricultural wealth, and by offering golden inducements to
Transvaal tradespeople, miners, and even Transvaal subjects, he hoped to
cause such an efflux from the Transvaal that the Government would be
embarrassed in less than two years.The country which bears his name
was found to be amazingly free from mountains of gold and rivers of
honey, and the several thousand persons who had faith in his alluring
promises remained in Rhodesia less than a year, and then returned to the
Transvaal.The reports of the Rhodesian country that were brought back by the
disappointed miners and settlers were not flattering to the condition of
the country or the justice of the Government.Of two evils, they chose
the lesser, and again placed themselves under the Kruger Government.When revolution and enticement failed to bring the Transvaal under the
British flag, Rhodes inaugurated a political propaganda.His last
resort was the Colonial Office in London, and in that alone lay the only
course by which he could attain his object.Again the franchise question was resorted to as the ground of the
contention, the dynamite and railway subjects having been so thoroughly
debated as to be as void of ground for further contention as they had
always been foreign to British control or interference.The question of
granting the right of voting to the Uitlanders in the Transvaal is one
which so vitally affects the future life of the Government that the
Boers' concession of that right would be tantamount to presenting the
country to the British Government.of the Uitlanders of the Transvaal are no more
than transient citizens.They were attracted thither by the gold mines
and the attendant industries, and they have no thought of staying in the
Transvaal a minute after they have amassed a fortune or a competency.Under no consideration would they remain in the country for the rest of
their lives, because the climate and nature of the country are not
conducive to a desire for long residence.It has been demonstrated that
less than one per cent.of the Uitlanders had sufficient interest in the
country to pass through the formality of securing naturalization papers
preparatory to becoming eligible for the franchise.The Boer Government has offered that all Uitlanders of nine years'
residence, having certain unimportant qualifications, should be
enfranchised in two years, and that others should be enfranchised in
seven years--two years for naturalization and five more years'
resident--before acquiring the right to vote.There is a provision for a property qualification, which makes it
necessary for the naturalized citizen to own a house of no less value
than two hundred and fifty dollars in renting value, or an income of one
thousand dollars.The residence clause in the Transvaal qualifications
compares favourably with those of London, where an Englishman from any
part of the country and settling in the municipality is obliged to live
two years and have certain property qualifications before acquiring the
right of franchise.In full knowledge of these conditions the Uitlanders insist upon having
an unconditional franchise--one that will require nothing more than a
two-years' residence in the country.The Boers are well aware of the
results that would follow the granting of the concessions demanded, but
not better so than the Uitlanders who make the demands.The latest
Transvaal statistics place the number of Boer burghers in the country at
less than thirty thousand.At the lowest estimate there are in the
Transvaal fifty thousand Uitlanders having the required qualifications,
and all of these would become voters in two years.At the first
election held after the two years had elapsed the Uitlanders would be
victorious, and those whom they elected would control the machinery of
the Government.The Uitlanders' plan is as transparent as air, yet it
has the approval and sanction of the English politicians, press, and
public.The propaganda which Rhodes and other politicians and stock brokers
interested in the Transvaal gold mines inaugurated a short time after
the Jameson raid has been successful in arousing the people in England
to what they have been led to believe is a situation unequalled in the
history of the empire-building.At the
same time the British Parliament was discussing the subject of the
alleged injustice under which the English residents of the Transvaal
were suffering, the colonial secretary was engaged in disposing of
grievances which reached him from the Dutch residents of British Guiana,
in South America, and which recited conditions parallel to those
complained of by the Uitlanders.The grievances were made by foreign
residents of English territory, instead of by English subjects in a
foreign country, and consequently demanded less serious attention, but
their justice was none the less patent.The three thousand native Dutch
voters in British Guiana have no voice in the legislative or
administrative branches of the colonial government, owing to the
peculiar laws which give to the three thousand British-born citizens the
complete control of the franchise.The population of the colony is
three hundred thousand, yet the three thousand British subjects make and
administer the laws for the other two hundred and ninety-seven thousand
inhabitants, who compose the mining and agricultural communities and are
treated with the same British contempt as the Boers.The Dutch
residents have made many appeals for a fuller representation in the
Government, but no reforms have been inaugurated or promised.The few grievances which the Uitlanders had before the Jameson raid have
been multiplied a hundredfold and no epithet is too venomous for them to
apply to the Boers.The letters in the home newspapers have allied the
name of the Boers with every vilifying adjective in the English
dictionary, and returning politicians have never failed to supply the
others that do not appear in the book.Petitions with thousands of names, some real, but many non-existent,
have been forwarded to the Colonial Office and to every other office in
London where they would be received, and these have recited grievances
that even the patient Boer Volksraad had never heard about.It has been
a propaganda of petitions and letters the like of which has no parallel
in the history of politics.It has been successful in arousing
sentiment favourable to the Uitlanders, and at this time there is hardly
a handful of persons in England who are not willing to testify to the
utter degradation of the Boers.Another branch of the propaganda operated through the Stock Exchange,
and its results were probably more practical than those of the literary
branch.It is easier to reach the English masses through the Stock
Exchange than by any other means.Whenever one of the "Kaffir" or
Transvaal companies failed to make both ends meet in a manner which
pleased the stockholders, it was only necessary to blame the Boer
Government for having impeded the digging of gold, and the stockholders
promptly outlined to the Colonial Office the policy it should pursue
toward the Boers.The impressions that are formed in watching the tide of events in the
Transvaal are that the Boer Government is not greatly inferior to the
Government of Lord Salisbury and Secretary Chamberlain.The only
appreciable difference between the two is that the Boers are fighting
the cause of the masses against the classes, while the English are
fighting that of the classes against the masses.In England, where the
rich have the power, the poor pay the taxes, while in the Transvaal the
poor have the power and compel the rich to pay the taxes.If the
Transvaal taxes were of such serious proportions as to be almost
unbearable, there might be a cause for interference by the Uitlander
capitalists who own the mines, but there no injustice is shown to any
one.The only taxes that the Uitlanders are compelled to pay are the
annual poll tax of less than four dollars and a half, mining taxes of a
dollar and a quarter a month for each claim for prospecting licenses,
and five dollars a claim for diggers' licenses.Boer and Uitlander are
compelled to pay these taxes without distinction.The Boers, in this contention, must win or die.In earlier days, before
every inch of African soil was under the flag of one country or another,
they were able to escape from English injustice by loading their few
possessions on wagons and "trekking" into new and unexplored lands.If
they yield their country to the English without a struggle, they will be
forced to live under a future Stock Exchange Government, which has been
described by a member of the British Parliament as likely to be "the
vilest, the most corrupt, and the most pernicious known to man."[#]


[#] The Hon.Henry Labouchere, in London Truth.The Boers have no better argument to advance in support of their claim
than that which is contained in the Transvaal national hymn.It at once
gives a history of their country, its many struggles and
disappointments, and its hopes.It is written in the "taal" of the
country, and when sung by the patriotic, deep-voiced Boers is one of the
most impressive hymns that ever inspired a nation.The four-colours of our dear old land
      Again float o'er Transvaal,
    And woe the God-forgetting hand
      That down our flag would haul!Wave higher now in clearer sky
      Our Transvaal freedom's stay!Our enemies with fright did fly;
      Now dawns a glorious day.Through many a storm ye bravely stood,
      And we stood likewise true;
    Now, that the storm is o'er, we would
      Leave nevermore from you
    Bestormed by Kaffir, Lion, Brit,
      Wave ever o'er their head;
    And then to spite we hoist thee yet
      Up to the topmost stead!Four long years did we beg--aye, pray--
      To keep our lands clear, free,
    We asked you, Brit, we loath the fray:
      "Go hence, and let us be!We've waited, Brit, we love you not,
      To arms we call the Boer;"
        (Lit., Now take we to our guns.)"You've teased us long enough, we troth,
      Now wait we nevermore."And with God's help we cast the yoke
      Of England from our knee;
    Our country safe--behold and look--
      Once more our flag waves free!Though many a hero's blood it cost,
      May all the nations see
        (Lit., Though England ever so much more.)That God the Lord redeemed our hosts;
      The glory his shall be.Wave high now o'er our dear old land,
      Wave four-colours of Transvaal!And woe the God-forgetting hand
      That dares you down to haul!Wave higher now in clearer sky
      Our Transvaal freedom's stay!Our enemies with fright did fly;
      Now dawns a glorious day.CHAPTER X

                        PREPARATIONS FOR DEFENCE


Ever since the Jameson raid both the Boers and the Uitlanders have
realized that a peaceful solution of the differences between the two is
possible but highly improbable.The Uitlanders refused to concede
anything to the Boer, and asked for concessions that implied a virtual
abandonment of their country to the English, whom they have always
detested.The Boers themselves have not been unmindful of the
inevitable war with their powerful antagonist, and, not unlike the tiny
ant of the African desert, which fortifies its abode against the
anticipated attack of wild beasts, have made of their country a
veritable arsenal.Probably no inland country in the world is half so well prepared for war
at any time as that little Government, which can boast of having less
than thirty thousand voters.The military preparation has been so
enormous that Great Britain has been compelled, according to the
colonial secretary's statement to the British Parliament, to expend two
and a half million dollars annually in South Africa in order to keep
pace with the Boers.Four years ago, when the Transvaal Government
learned that the Uitlanders of Johannesburg were planning a revolution,
it commenced the military preparations which have ever since continued
with unabating vigour.German experts were employed to formulate plans
for the defence of the country, and European artillerists were secured
to teach the arts of modern warfare to the men at the head of the Boer
army.Several Americans of military training became the instructors in
the national military school at Pretoria; and even the women and
children became imbued with the necessity of warlike preparation, and
learned the use of arms.Several million pounds were annually spent in
Europe in the purchase of the armament required by the plans formulated
by the experts, and the whole country was placed on a war footing.Every important strategic position was made as impregnable as modern
skill and arms could make it, and every farmer's cottage was supplied
with arms and ammunition, so that the volunteer army might be mobilized
in a day.In order to demonstrate the extent to which the military preparation has
been carried, it is only necessary to give an account of the defences of
Pretoria and Johannesburg, the two principal cities of the country.Pretoria, being the capital, and naturally the chief point of attack by
the enemy, has been prepared to resist the onslaught of any number of
men, and is in a condition to withstand a siege of three years.The
city lies in the centre of a square, at each corner of which is a lofty
hill surmounted by a strong fort, which commands the valleys and the
surrounding country.Each of the four forts has four heavy cannon, four
French guns of fifteen miles range, and thirty heavy Gatling guns.Besides this extraordinary protection, the city has fifty light Gatling
guns which can be drawn by mules to any point on the hills where an
attack may be made.Three large warehouses are filled with ammunition,
and the large armory is packed to the eaves with Mauser, Martini-Henry,
and Wesley-Richards rifles.Two extensive refrigerators, with a
capacity of two thousand oxen each, are ample provision against a siege
of many months.It is difficult to compute the total expenditures for
war material by the Boer Government during the last four years, but the
following official announcement of expenses for one year will serve to
give an idea of the vastness of the preparations that the Government has
been compelled to make in order to guard the safety of the country:

    War-Office salaries .$262,310
    War purposes.4,717,550
    Johannesburg revolt .800,000
    Public works.3,650,000
                                           ----------
                                           $9,429,860


Johannesburg has extensive fortifications around it, but the Boers will
use them for other purposes than those of self-protection.The forts at
the Golden City were erected for the purpose of quelling any revolution
of the Uitlanders, who constitute almost entirely the population of the
city.One of the forts is situated on a small eminence about half a mile north
of the business part, and commands the entire city with its guns.Two
years were consumed in building the fortification and in placing the
armament in position.Its guns can rake not only every street of the
city, but ten of the principal mine works as well, and the damage that
their fire could cause is incalculable.Another fort, almost as strong
as the one in Johannesburg, is situated a mile east of the city, and
overshadows the railway and the principal highway to Johannesburg.The
residents of the city are greatly in fear of underground works, which
they have been led to believe were constructed since the raid.Vast
quantities of earth were taken out of the Johannesburg fort, and for
such a length of time did the work continue that the Uitlanders decided
that the Boers were undermining the city, and protested to the
Government against such a course.As soon as war is declared and the
women and children have been removed from the city, Johannesburg will be
rent with shot and shell.The Boers have announced their intention of
doing this, and the Uitlanders, anticipating it, seek safety in flight
whenever there are rumours of war, as thousands did immediately before
and after the Jameson affair.The approaches to the mountain passes on the border have been fortified
with vast quantities of German and French ordnance, and equipped with
garrisons of men born or trained in Europe.The approaches to Laing's
Nek, near the Natal border, which have several times been the battle
ground of the English and Boer forces, have been prepared to resist an
invading army from Natal.Much attention has been directed to the
preparations in that part of the republic, because the British
commanders will find it easier to transfer forces from the port of
Durban, which is three hundred and six miles from the Transvaal border,
while Cape Town is almost a thousand miles distant.But the Pretorian Government has made many provisions for war other than
those enumerated.It has made alliances and friends that will be of
equal worth in the event of an attack by England.The Orange Free
State, whose existence is as gravely imperilled as that of the
Transvaal, will fight hand-in-hand with its neighbour, just as it was
prepared to do at the time of the Jameson raid, when almost every Free
State burgher lay armed on the south bank of the Vaal River, awaiting
the summons for assistance from the Kruger Government.In the event of
war the two Governments will be as one, and, in anticipation of the
struggle of the Boers against the British, the Free State Government has
been expending vast sums of money every year in strengthening the
country's defences.At the same time that the Free State is being
prepared for war, its Government officials are striving hard to prevent
a conflict, and are attempting to conciliate the two principals in the
strife by suggesting that concessions be made by both.The Free State
is not so populous as the Transvaal, and consequently can not place as
many men in the field, but the ten thousand burghers who will answer the
call to arms will be an acceptable addition to the Boer forces.The element of doubt enters into the question of what the Boers and
their co-religionists of Cape Colony and Natal will do in the event of
war.The Dutch of Cape Colony are the majority of the population, and,
although loyal British subjects under ordinary circumstances, are
opposed to English interference in the Transvaal's affairs.Those of
Natal, while not so great in numbers, are equally friendly with the
Transvaal Boers, and would undoubtedly recall some of their old
grievances against the British Government as sufficient reason to join
the Boers in war.In Cape Colony there is an organization called the Afrikander Bond which
recently has gained control of the politics of the colony, and which
will undoubtedly be supreme for many years to come.The motto of the
organization is "South Africa for South Africans," and its doctrine is
that South Africa shall be served first and Great Britain afterward.Its members, who are chiefly Dutch, believe their first duty is to
assist the development of the resources of their own country by proper
protective tariffs and stringent legislation in native affairs, and they
regard legislation with a view to British interests as of secondary
importance.The Bond has been very amicably inclined toward its
Afrikander kinsmen in the Transvaal, especially since the Jameson raid,
and every sign of impending trouble between England and the Boers widens
the chasm between the English and Afrikanders of South Africa.The
Dutch approve of President Kruger's course in dealing with the franchise
problems, and if hostilities break out it would be not the least
incompatible with their natures to assist their Transvaal and Free State
kinsmen even at the risk of plunging the whole of South Africa into a
civil war.W. P. Schreiner, the Premier of Cape Colony, is the leading
member of the Bond, and with him he has associated the majority of the
leading men in the colony.Under ordinary conditions their loyalty to
Great Britain is undoubted, but whether they could resist the influence
of their friends in the Bond if it should decide to cast its fortunes
with the Boers in case of war is another matter.Of such vast importance is the continued loyalty of the Dutch of the two
colonies that upon it depends practically the future control of the Cape
by the British Government.Being in the majority as three to two, and
almost in supreme control of the local government, the Dutch of Cape
Colony are in an excellent position to secede from the empire, as they
have already threatened to do, in which event England would be obliged
to fight almost the united population of the whites if she desired to
retain control of the country.With this in mind, it is no wonder that
Mr.Chamberlain declared that England had reached a critical turning
point in the history of the empire.The uncertainty of the situation is increased by the doubtful stand
which the native races are taking in the dispute.Neither England nor
the Boers has the positive assurance of support from any of the tribes,
which outnumber the whites as ten to one; but it will not be an
unwarranted opinion to place the majority of the native tribes on the
side of the Boers.The native races are always eager to be the friends
of the paramount power, and England's many defeats in South Africa
during recent years have not assisted in gaining for it that prestige.When England enters upon a war with the Transvaal the natives will
probably follow the example of the Matabele natives, who rebelled
against the English immediately after Jameson and his men were defeated
by the Boers, because they believed a conquered nation could offer no
resistance.The Boers, having won the last battle, are considered by the
natives to be the paramount power, and it is always an easy matter to
induce a subjected people to ally itself with a supposedly powerful one.The Zulus, still stinging under the defeat which they received from the
British less than twenty years ago, might gather their war parties and,
with the thousands of guns they have been allowed to buy, attempt to
secure revenge.The Basutos, east of the Orange Free State, now the
most powerful and the only undefeated nation in the country, would
hardly allow a war to be fought unless they participated in it, even if
only to demonstrate to the white man that they still retain their
old-time courage and ability.The million and a half natives in Cape
Colony, and the equal number in the Transvaal, have complained of so
many alleged grievances at the hands of their respective governments
that they might be presumed to rise against them, though it is never
possible to determine the trend of the African <DW64>'s mind.What the
various tribes would do in such an emergency can be answered only by the
chiefs themselves, and they will not speak until the time for action is
at hand.Perhaps when that time does arrive there may be a realization
of the natives' dream--that a great leader will come from the north who
will organize all the various tribes into one grand army and with it
drive the hated white men into the sea.It is impossible to secure accurate statistics in regard to the military
strength of the various colonies, states, and tribes in the country, but
the following table gives a fair idea of the number of men who are
liable to military duty:

                              Dutch.Cape Colony               20,000        10,000        177,000
    Natal                      7,000         5,000        100,000
    Orange Free State         10,000       ......         30,000
    Transvaal                 30,000        20,000        140,000
    Rhodesia                 ......         2,000         25,000
    Swaziland and Basutoland ......       ......         30,000
                              ------        ------        -------
    Total                     67,000        37,000        570,000


To him who delights in forming possible coalitions and war situations
this table offers vast opportunities.Probably no other country can
offer such a vast number of possibilities for compacts between nations,
races, and tribes as is presented in South Africa.There all the
natives may unite against the whites, or a part of them against a part
of the whites, while whites and natives may unite against a similar
combination.The possibilities are boundless; the probabilities are
uncertain.The Pretorian Government has had an extensive secret service for several
years, and this has been of inestimable value in securing the support of
the natives as well as the friendship of many whites, both in South
Africa and abroad.The several thousand Irishmen in South Africa have
been organized into a secret compact, and have been and will continue to
be of great value to the Boers.The head of the organization is a man
who is one of President Kruger's best friends, and his lieutenants are
working even as far away as America.The sympathy of the majority of
the Americans in the Transvaal is with the Boer cause, and, although the
American consul-general at Cape Town has cautioned them to remain
neutral, they will not stand idly by and watch the defeat of a cause
which they believe to be as just as that for which their forefathers
fought at Bunker Hill and Lexington.But the Boers do not rely upon external assistance to win their battles
for them.When it becomes necessary to defend their liberty and their
country they reverently place their trust in Providence and their
rifles.Their forefathers' battles were won with such confidence, and
the later generations have been similarly successful under like
conditions.The rifle is the young Boer's primer and the grandfather's
testament.It is the Boers' avenger of wrong and the upholder of right.That their confidence in their rifles has not been misapplied has been
demonstrated at Laing's Nek, Majuba Hill, Doornkop, and in battles with
natives.The natural opportunities provided by Nature which in former years were
responsible for the confidence which the Boers reposed in their rifles
may have disappeared with the approach of advancing civilization, but
the Boer of to-day is as dangerous an adversary with a gun as his father
was in the wars with the Zulus and the Matabeles half a century ago.The
buck, rhinoceros, elephant, and hippopotamus are not as numerous now as
then, but the Boer has devised other means by which he may perfect
himself in marksmanship.Shooting is one of the main diversions of the
Boer, and prizes are offered for the best results in contests.It is
customary to mark out a ring, about two hundred and fifty feet in
diameter, in the centre of which a small stuffed figure resembling a
bird is attached to a pole.The marksmen stand on the outside of the
circle and fire in turn at the target.A more curious target, and one
that taxes the ability of the marksman, is in more general use
throughout the country.A hole sufficiently deep to retain a
turkey-cock is dug in a level plot of ground, and over this is placed a
piece of canvas which contains a small hole through which the bird can
extend and withdraw its head.At a distance of three hundred feet the
bird's head is a target by no means easily hit.Military men are accustomed to sneer at the lack of generalship of the
Boer forces, but in only one of the battles in which they have engaged
the British forces have the trained military men and leaders been able
to cope with them.In the battle of Boomplaats, fought in 1848, the
English officers can claim their only victory over the Boers, who were
armed with flintlocks, while the British forces had heavy artillery.In
almost all the encounters that have taken place the Boer forces were not
as large as those of the enemy, yet the records show that many more
casualties were inflicted than received by them.In the chief
engagements the appended statistics show that the Boers had only a small
percentage of their men in the casualty list, while the British losses
were much greater.Laing's Nek           400        550          190         24
    Ingogo                300        250          142         17
    Majuba Hill           600        150          280          5
    Bronkhorst            250        300          120          1
    Jameson raid          600        400          100          5


It is hardly fair to assume that the Boers' advantages in these battles
were gained without the assistance of capable generals when it is taken
into consideration that there is a military axiom which places the value
of an army relatively with the ability of its commanders.The Boers may
exaggerate when they assert that one of their soldiers is the equal in
fighting ability of five British soldiers, but the results of the
various battles show that they have some slight foundation for their
theory.The regular British force in South Africa is comparatively small, but it
would require less than a month to transport one hundred thousand
trained soldiers from India and England and place them on the scene of
action.Several regiments of trained soldiers are always stationed in
different parts of the country near the Transvaal border, and at brief
notice they could be placed on Boer territory.Charlestown, Ladysmith,
and Pietermaritzburg, in Natal, have been British military headquarters
for many years, and during the last three years they have been
strengthened by the addition of several regular regiments.The British
Colonial Office has been making preparations for several years for a
conflict.Every point in the country has been strengthened, and all the
foreign powers whose interests in the country might lead them to
interfere in behalf of the Boers have been placated.Germany has been
taken from the British zone of danger by favourable treaties; France is
fearful to try interference alone; and Portugal, the only other nation
interested, is too weak and too deeply in England's debt to raise her
voice against anything that may be done.By leasing the town of Lorenzo Marques from the Portuguese Government,
Great Britain has acquired one of the best strategic points in South
Africa.The lease, the terms of which are unannounced, was the
culmination of much diplomatic dickering, in which the interests of
Germany and the South African Republic were arrayed against those of
England and Portugal.There is no doubt that England made the lease
only in order to gain an advantage over President Kruger, and to prevent
him from further fortifying his country with munitions of war imported
by way of Lorenzo Marques and Delagoa Bay.England gains a commercial
advantage too, but it is hardly likely that she would care to add the
worst fever-hole in Africa to her territory simply to please the few of
her merchants who have business interests in the town.Since the Jameson
raid the Boers have been purchasing vast quantities of guns and
ammunition in Europe for the purpose of preparing themselves for any
similar emergency.Delagoa Bay alone was an open port to the Transvaal,
every other port in South Africa being under English dominion and
consequently closed to the importation of war material.Lorenzo
Marques, the natural port of the Transvaal, is only a short distance
from the eastern border of that country, and is connected with Pretoria
and Johannesburg by a railway.It was over this railway that the Boers
were able to carry the guns and ammunition with which to fortify their
country, and England could not raise a finger to prevent the little
republic from doing as it pleased.Hardly a month has passed since the
raid that the Transvaal authorities did not receive a large consignment
of guns and powder from Germany and France by way of Lorenzo Marques.England could do nothing more than have several detectives at the docks
to take an inventory of the munitions as they passed in transit.The transfer of Lorenzo Marques to the British will put an effectual bar
to any further importation of guns into the Transvaal, and will
practically prevent any foreign assistance from reaching the Boers in
the event of another war.Both Germany and England tried for many years
to induce Portugal to sell Delagoa Bay, but being the debtor of both to
a great extent, the sale could not be made to one without arousing the
enmity of the other.Eighteen or twenty years ago Portugal would have
sold her sovereign right over the port to Mr.Gladstone's Government for
sixty thousand dollars, but that was before Delagoa Bay had any
commercial or political importance.Since then Germany became the
political champion of the Transvaal, and blocked all the schemes of
England to isolate the inland country by cutting off its only neutral
connection with the sea.Recently, however, Germany has been
disappointed by the Transvaal Republic, and one of the results is the
present cordial relations between the Teutons and the Anglo-Saxons in
South African affairs.The English press and people in South Africa have always asserted that
by isolating the Transvaal from the sea the Boers could be starved into
submission in case of a war.As soon as the lease becomes effective, Mr.Kruger's country will be completely surrounded by English territory, at
least in such a way that nothing can be taken into the Transvaal without
first passing through an English port, and no foreign power will be able
to send forces to the aid of the Boers unless they are first landed on
British soil.It is doubtful whether any nation would incur such a
grave responsibility for the sake of securing Boer favour.Both the Transvaal and England are fully prepared for war, and diplomacy
only can postpone its coming.The Uitlanders' present demands may be
conceded, but others that will follow may not fare so well.A coveted
country will always be the object of attacks by a stronger power, and
the aggressor generally succeeds in securing from the weaker victim
whatever he desires.Whether British soldiers will be obliged to fight
the Boers alone in order to gratify the wishes of their Government, or
whether the enemy will be almost the entire white and black population
of South Africa, will not be definitely known until the British troop
ships start for Cape Town and Durban.[Illustration: Cape Town and Table Mountain.]Whichever enemy it will be, the British Government will attack, and will
pursue in no half-hearted or half-prepared manner, as it has done in
previous campaigns in the country.The Boers will be able to resist and
to prolong the campaign to perhaps eight months or a year, but they will
finally be obliterated from among the nations of the earth.It will
cost the British Empire much treasure and many lives, but it will
satisfy those who caused it--the politicians and speculators.CHAPTER XI

                   AMERICAN INTERESTS IN SOUTH AFRICA


An idea of the nature and extent of American enterprise in South Africa
might be deduced from the one example of a Boston book agent, who made a
competency by selling albums of United States scenery to the <DW64>s
along the shores of the Umkomaas River, near Zululand.The book agent
is not an incongruity of the activity of Americans in that part of the
continent, but an example rather of the diversified nature of the
influences which owe their origin to the nation of Yankees ten thousand
miles distant.The United States of America have had a deeper influence
upon South Africa than that which pertains to commerce and trade.The
progress, growth, and prosperity of the American States have instilled
in the minds of the majority of South Africans a desire to be free from
European control, and to be united under a single banner, which is to
bear the insignia of the United States of South Africa.In public, editors and speechmakers in Cape Colony, Natal, and the
Transvaal spend hours in deploring the progress of Americanisms in South
Africa, but in their clubs and libraries they study and discuss the
causes which led to America's progress and pre-eminence, and form plans
by which they may be able to attain the same desirable ends.The
influence and example of the United States are not theoretical; they are
political factors which are felt in the discussion of every public
question and in the results of every election.The practical results of
American influence in South Africa may now be observed only in the
increasing exports to that country, but perhaps in another generation a
greater and better demonstration will be found in a constitution which
unites all the South African states under one independent government.If any corroboration of this sentiment were necessary, a statement made
by the man who is leader of the ruling party in Cape Colony would be
ample."If we want an example of the highest type of freedom," said W. P.
Schreiner, the present Premier of Cape Colony, "we must look to the
United States of America."[#]


[#] Americans' Fourth of July Banquet, Cape Town, 1897.American influences are felt in all phases of South African life, be
they social, commercial, religious, political, or retrogressive.Whether it be the American book agent on the banks of the Umkomaas, or
the American consul-general in the governor's mansion at Cape Town, his
indomitable energy, his breezy indifference to apparently insurmountable
difficulties, and his boundless resources will always secure for him
those material benefits for which men of other nationalities can do no
more than hope.Some of his rivals call it perverseness, callousness,
trickery, treachery, and what not; his admirers might ascribe his
success to energy, pluck, modern methods, or to that quality best
described by that Americanism--"hustling."American commercial interests in South Africa are of such recent growth,
and already of such great proportions, that the other nations who have
been interested in the trade for many years are not only astounded, but
are fearful that the United States will soon be the controlling spirit
in the country's commercial affairs.The enterprise of American
business firms, and their ability to undersell almost all the other
firms represented in the country, have given an enormous impetus to the
export trade with South African countries.Systematic efforts have been
made by American firms to work the South African markets on an extensive
scale, and so successful have the efforts been that the value of exports
to that country has several times been more than doubled in a single
year.Five years ago America's share of the business of South Africa was
practically infinitesimal; to-day the United States hold second place in
the list of nations which have trade relations with that country, having
outranked Germany, France, Belgium, Holland, and Italy.In several
branches of trade America surpasses even England, which has always had
all the trade advantages owing to the supremacy of her flag over the
greater part of the country.That the British merchants are keenly alive
to the situation which threatens to transfer the trade supremacy into
American hands has been amply demonstrated by the efforts which they
have made to check the inroads the Americans are making on their field,
and by the appointment of committees to investigate the causes of the
decline of British commerce.American enterprise shows itself by the scores of representatives of
American business houses who are constantly travelling through the
country, either to secure orders or to investigate the field with a view
of entering into competition with the firms of other nations.Fifteen
American commercial travellers, representing as many different firms,
were registered at the Grand Hotel, Cape Town, at one time a year ago,
and that all had secured exceptionally heavy orders indicated that the
innovation in the method of working trade was successful.The laws of the country are unfavourable in no slight degree to the
foreign commercial travellers, who are obliged to pay heavy licenses
before they are permitted to enter upon any business negotiations.The
tax in the Transvaal and Natal is $48.66, and in the Orange Free State
and Cape Colony it amounts to $121.66.If an American agent wishes to
make a tour of all the states and colonies of the country, he is obliged
to pay almost three hundred and fifty dollars in license fees.The great superiority of certain American manufactured products is such
that other nations are unable to compete in those lines after the
American products have been introduced.Especially is this true of
American machinery, which can not be equalled by that of any other
country.Almost every one of the hundreds of extensive gold mines on
the Randt is fitted out wholly or in part with American machinery, and,
at the present rate of increase in the use of it, it will be less than
ten years when none other than United States machinery will be sent to
that district.In visiting the great mines the uninitiated American is
astonished to find that engines, crushing machinery, and even the
electric lights which illuminate them, bear the name plates of New York,
Philadelphia, and Chicago firms.The Kimberley diamond mines, which are among the most extensive and most
elaborate underground works in the world, use American-made machinery
almost exclusively, not only because it is much less costly, but because
no other country can furnish apparatus that will give as good results.Almost every pound of electrical machinery in use in the country was
made in America and was instituted by American workmen.Instances of successful American electrical enterprises are afforded by
the Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and Pretoria street railways, almost
every rail, wire, and car of which bears the marks of American
manufacture.It is a marvellous revelation to find Philadelphia-made
electric cars in the streets of Cape Town, condensing engines from New
York State in Port Elizabeth, and Pittsburg generators and switchboards
in the capital of the Transvaal, which less than fifty years ago was
under the dominion of savages.Not only did Americans install the
street railways, but they also secured the desirable concessions for
operating the lines for a stated period.American electricians operate
the plants, and in not a few instances have financially embarrassed
Americans received a new financial impetus by acting in the capacities
of motormen and conductors.One street car in Cape Town was for a long time distinguished because of
its many American features.The Philadelphia-made car was propelled
over Pittsburg tracks by means of the power passing through Wilkesbarre
wires, and the human agencies that controlled it were a Boston motorman
and a San Francisco conductor.It might not be pursuing the subject too
far to add that of the twelve passengers in the car on a certain journey
ten were Americans, representing eight different States.One of the first railroads in South Africa--that which leads from
Lorenzo Marques to the Transvaal border--was built by an American, a Mr.Murdock, while American material entered largely into the construction
of the more extensive roads from the coast to the interior.American
rails are more quickly and more cheaply[#] obtainable in South Africa
than those of English make, but the influence which is exerted against
the use of other than British rails prevents their universal adoption.Notwithstanding the efforts of the influential Englishmen to secure
British manufactures wherever and whenever possible, American firms have
recently secured the contracts for forty thousand tons of steel rails
for the Cape Colony Railway system, and the prospects are that more
orders of a similar nature will be forthcoming.[#] "But the other day we gave an order for two hundred and fifty miles
of rails.We had a large number of tenders, and the lowest tender, you
may be sorry to hear, was sent by an American, Mr.Fortunately, however, the tender was not in order, and we were therefore
able to give the work to our own people.It may be said that this
American tender was a question of workmen and strikes."--Cecil J.
Rhodes, at a meeting of the stockholders of the Cape-Cairo Railway,
London, May 2, 1899.It is not in the sale of steel rails alone that the American
manufacturer is forging ahead of his competitors in South Africa.American manufactured wares of all kinds are in demand, and in many
instances they are leaders in the market.Especially true is this of
American agricultural implements, which are so much more adaptable to
the soil and much cheaper than any other make.Small stores in the
farming communities of Natal and Cape Colony sell American ploughshares,
spades, forks, rakes, and hoes almost exclusively, and it amazes the
traveller to find that almost every plough and reaper used by the more
progressive agriculturists bears the imprint "Made in the United
States."It is a strange fact that, although South Africa has vast areas covered
with heavy timber, almost all the lumber used in the mining districts is
transported thither from Puget Sound.The native timber being unsuited
for underground purposes and difficult of access, all the mine owners
are obliged to import every foot of wood used in constructing surface
and underground works of their mines, and at great expense, for to the
original cost of the timber is added the charges arising from the sea
and land transportation, import duties, and handling.The docks at Cape
Town almost all the year round contain one or more lumber vessels from
Puget Sound, and upon several occasions five such vessels were being
unloaded at the same time.American coal, too, has secured a foothold in South Africa, a sample
cargo of three thousand tons having been despatched thither at the
beginning of the year.Coal of good quality is found in several parts
of the Transvaal and Natal, but progress in the development of the mines
has been so slow that almost the total demand is supplied by Wales.Cape Colony has an extensive petroleum field, but it is in the hands of
concessionaires, who, for reasons of their own, refuse to develop it.American and Russian petroleums are used exclusively, but the former is
preferred, and is rapidly crowding the other out of the market.Among the many other articles of export to South Africa are flour, corn,
butter, potatoes, canned meats, and vegetables--all of which might be
produced in the country if South Africans took advantage of the
opportunities offered by soil and Nature.American live stock has been
introduced into the country since the rinderpest disease destroyed
almost all of the native cattle, and with such successful results that
several Western firms have established branches in Cape Town, and are
sending thither large cargoes of mules, horses, cattle, and sheep.Cecil J. Rhodes has recently stocked his immense Rhodesian farm with
American live stock, and, as his example is generally followed
throughout the country, a decided increase in the live-stock export
trade is anticipated.Statistics only can give an adequate idea of American trade with South
Africa; but even these are not reliable, for the reason that a large
percentage of the exports sent to the country are ordered through London
firms, and consequently do not appear in the official figures.As a
criterion of what the trade amounts to, it will only be necessary to
quote a few statistics, which, however, do not represent the true totals
for the reason given.The estimated value of the exports and the
percentage increase of each year's business over that of the preceding
year is given, in order that a true idea of the growth of American trade
with South Africa may be formed:

    YEAR.Per cent
                                         increase.1895                  $5,000,000
    1896                  12,000,000        140
    1897                  16,000,000         33 1/8
    1898 (estimated)      20,000,000         25


A fact that is deplored by Americans who are eager to see their country
in the van in all things pertaining to trade is that almost every
dollar's worth of this vast amount of material is carried to South
Africa in ships sailing under foreign colours.Three lines of
steamships, having weekly sailings, ply between the two countries, and
are always laden to the rails with American goods, but the American flag
is carried by none of them.A fourth line of steamships, to ply between
Philadelphia and Cape Town, is about to be established under American
auspices, and is to carry the American flag.A number of small American
sailing vessels trade between the two countries, but their total
capacity is so small as to be almost insignificant when compared with
the great volume carried in foreign bottoms.The American imports from South Africa are of far less value than the
exports, for the reason that the country produces only a few articles
that are not consumed where they originate.America is the best market
in the world for diamonds, and about one fourth of the annual output of
the Kimberley mines reaches the United States.Hides and tallow
constitute the leading exportations to America, while aloes and ostrich
feathers are chief among the few other products sent here.Owing to this
lack of exports, ships going to South Africa are obliged to proceed to
India or Australia for return cargoes in order to reduce the expenses of
the voyage.However great the commercial interests of the United States in South
Africa, they are small in comparison with the work of individual
Americans, who have been active in the development of that country
during the last quarter of a century.Wherever great enterprises have
been inaugurated, Americans have been prominently identified with their
growth and development, and in not a few instances has the success of
the ventures been wholly due to American leadership.European capital
is the foundation of all the great South African institutions, but it is
to American skill that almost all of them owe the success which they
have attained.British and continental capitalists have recognised the superiority of
American methods by intrusting the management of almost every large mine
and industry to men who were born and received their training in the
United States.It is an expression not infrequently heard when the
success of a South African enterprise is being discussed, "Who is the
Yankee?"The reason of this is involved in the fact that almost all the
Americans who went to South Africa after the discovery of gold had been
well fitted by their experiences in the California and Colorado mining
fields for the work which they were called upon to do on the Randt, and,
owing to their ability, were able to compete successfully with the men
from other countries who were not so skilled.Unfortunately, not all the Americans in South Africa have been a credit
to their native country, and there is a considerable class which has
created for itself an unenviable reputation.The component parts of
this class are men who, by reason of criminal acts, were obliged to
leave America for new fields of endeavour, and non-professional men who
follow gold booms in all parts of the world and trust to circumstances
for a livelihood.In the early days of the Johannesburg gold fields
these men oftentimes resorted to desperate means, with the result that
almost every criminal act of an unusually daring description is now
credited against them by the orderly inhabitants.Highwaymen,
pickpockets, illicit gold buyers, confidence men, and even train-robbers
were active, and for several years served to discredit the entire
American colony.Since the first gold excitement has subsided, this
class of Americans, in which was also included by the residents all the
other criminal characters of whatever nationality, has been compelled to
leave the country, and to-day the American colony in Johannesburg
numbers about three thousand of the most respected citizens of the city.The American who has been most prominent in South African affairs, and
the stanchest supporter of American interests in that country, is
Gardner F. Williams, the general manager and one of the alternate life
governors of the De Beers Consolidated Diamond Mines at Kimberley.Williams gained his mining experience in the
mining districts of California and other Western States, and went to
South Africa in 1887 to take charge of the Kimberley mines, which were
then in an almost chaotic condition.By the application of American
ideas, Mr.Williams succeeded in making of the mines a property which
yields an annual profit of about ten million dollars on a nominal
capital of twice that amount.He has introduced American machinery into
the mines, and has been instrumental in many other ways in advancing the
interests of his native country.Williams receives a salary
twice as great as that of the President of the United States, he is
proud to be the American consular agent at Kimberley--an office which
does not carry with it sufficient revenue to provide the star-spangled
banner which constantly floats from a staff in front of his residence.J. Perrott Prince is another American who has assisted materially in
extending American interests in South Africa, and it is due to his own
unselfish efforts that the commerce of the United States with the port
of Durban has risen from insignificant volume to its present size.Prince was a surgeon in the Union army during the civil war, and
afterward was one of the first Americans to go to the Kimberley diamond
fields.Leander Starr Jameson to
accompany him to Kimberley in the capacity of assistant surgeon--a
service which he performed with great distinction until Mr.Rhodes sent
him into Matabeleland to take charge of the military forces, which later
he led into the Transvaal.Prince's renown as a physician was responsible for a call to
Madagascar, whither he was summoned by Queen Ranavalo.He remained in
Madagascar as the queen's physician until the French took forcible
possession of the island and sent the queen into exile on the Reunion
Islands.Prince has lived in Durban, Natal, for several years, and
during the greater part of that time conducted the office of American
consular agent at a financial loss to himself.Prince was obliged to end his connection with the consular service, and
the United States are now represented in Durban by a foreigner, who on
the last Fourth of July inquired why all the Americans in the city were
making such elaborate displays of bunting and the Stars and Stripes.The consular agent at Johannesburg is John C. Manion, of Herkimer, N.Y.,
who represents a large American machinery company.Manion, in 1896,
carried on the negotiations with the Transvaal Government by which John
Hays Hammond, an American mining engineer, was released from the
Pretoria prison, where he had been confined for complicity in the
uprising at Johannesburg.American machinery valued at several million
dollars has been sent to South Africa as the result of Mr.In the gold industry on the Randt, Americans have been specially active,
and it is due to one of them, J. S. Curtis, that the deep-level mines
were discovered.In South Africa a mining claim extends only a
specified distance below the surface of the earth, and the Governments
do not allow claim-owners to dig beyond that depth.Curtis found
that paying reefs existed below the specified depth, and the result was
that the Government sold the underground or deep-level claims with great
profit to itself and the mining community.The consulting engineers of almost all the mines of any importance in
the country are Americans, and their salaries range from ten thousand to
one hundred thousand dollars a year.John Hays Hammond, who was one of
the first American engineers to reach the gold fields, was official
mining engineer for the Transvaal Government, and received a yearly
salary of twenty-five thousand dollars for formulating the mining laws
of the country.He resigned that office, and is now the consulting
engineer for the British South Africa Company in Rhodesia and several
gold mines on the Randt, at salaries which aggregate almost one hundred
thousand dollars a year.Among the scores of other American engineers on
the Randt are L. I. Seymour, who has control of the thirty-six shafts of
the Randt Mines; Captain Malan, of the Robinson mines; and H. S. Watson,
of the Simmer en Jack mines, in developing which more than ten million
dollars have been spent.Another American introduced the system of treating the abandoned
tailings of the mines by the cyanide process, whereby thousands of
ounces of gold have been abstracted from the offal of the mills, which
had formerly been considered valueless.Others have revolutionized
different parts of the management of the mines, and in many instances
have taken abandoned properties and placed them on a paying basis.It
would not be fair to claim that American ingenuity and skill are
responsible for the entire success of the Randt gold mines, but it is
indisputable that Americans have done more toward it than the combined
representatives of all other nations.Every line of business on the Randt has its American representatives,
and almost without exception the firms who sent them thither chose able
men.W. E. Parks, of Chicago, represents Frazer & Chalmers, whose
machinery is in scores of the mines.His assistant is W. H. Haig, of
New York city.The American Trading and Importing Company, with its headquarters in
Johannesburg, and branches in every city and town in the country, deals
exclusively in American manufactured products, and annually sells
immense quantities of bicycles, stoves, beer, carriages, and other
goods, ranging from pins to pianos.Americans do not confine their endeavours to commercial enterprises, and
they may be found conducting missionary work among the Matabeles and
Mashonas, as well as building dams in Rhodesia.American missionaries
are very active in all parts of South Africa, and because of the
practical methods by which they endeavour to civilize and Christianize
the natives they have the reputation throughout the country of being
more successful than those who go there from any other country.Rhodes has given many contributions of land and
money to the American missionaries, and has on several occasions
complimented them by pronouncing their achievements unparalleled.A practical illustration will demonstrate the causes of the success of
the American missionary.An English missionary spent the first two
years after his arrival in the country in studying the natives' language
and in building a house for himself.In that time he had made no
converts.An American missionary arrived at almost the same time,
rented a hut, and hired interpreters.At the end of two years he had
one hundred and fifty converts, many more natives who were learning
useful occupations and trades, and had sent home a request for more
missionaries with which to extend his field.It is rather remarkable that the scouts who assisted in subduing the
American Indians should later be found on the African continent to
assist in the extermination of the blacks.In the Matabele and Mashona
campaigns of three years ago, Americans who scouted for Custer and Miles
on the Western plains were invaluable adjuncts to the British forces,
and in many instances did heroic work in finding the location of the
enemy and in making way for the American Maxim guns that were used in
the campaigns.The Americans in South Africa, although only about ten thousand in
number, have been of invaluable service to the land.They have taught
the farmers to farm, the miners to dig gold, and the statesmen to
govern.Their work has been a credit to the country which they continue
to revere, and whose flag they raise upon every proper occasion.They
have taken little part in the political disturbances of the Transvaal,
because they believe that the citizens of a republic should be allowed
to conduct its government according to their own idea of right and
justice, independently of the demands of those who are not citizens.CHAPTER XII

                         JOHANNESBURG OF TO-DAY


The palms and bamboos of Durban, the Zulu policemen and 'ricksha boys,
and the hospitable citizens have been left behind, and the little train
of English compartment cars, each with its destination "Johannesburg"
labelled conspicuously on its sides, is winding away through cane fields
and banana groves, past groups of open-eyed natives and solemn,
thin-faced Indian coolies.Pretty little farmers' cottages in settings of palms, mimosas, and
tropical plants are dotted in the green valleys winding around the
innumerable small hills that look for all the world like so many
inverted moss-covered china cups.Lumbering transport wagons behind a
score of sleek oxen, wincing under the fire of the far-reaching rawhide
in the hands of a sparsely clad Zulu driver, are met and passed in a
twinkling.Neatly thatched huts with natives lazily lolling in the sun
become more frequent as the train rolls on toward the interior, and the
greenness of the landscape is changing into the brown of dead verdure,
for it is the dry season--the South African winter.The hills become
more frequent, and the little locomotive goes more slowly, while the
train twists and writhes along its path like a huge python.Now it is on the hilltop from which the distant sea and its coast fringe
of green are visible on the one side, and nothing but treeless brown
mountain tops on the other.A minute later it plunges down the
hillside, along rocky precipices, over deep chasms, and then wearily
plods up the zigzag course of another hillside.For five hours or more
the monotony of miniature mountains continues, relieved by nothing more
interesting than the noise of the train and the hilarious laughter and
weird songs of a car load of Zulus bound for the gold fields.After
this comes an undulating plain and towns with far less interest in their
appearance than in their names.The traveller surfeited with Natal
scenery finds amusement and diversion in the conductor's call of Umbilo,
Umkomaas, Umgeni, Amanzimtoti, Isipingo, Mooi River, Zwartkop, or
Pietermaritzburg, but will not attempt to learn the proper pronunciation
of the names unless he has weeks at his command.[Illustration: Zulu maidens shaking hands.]Farther on in the journey an ostrich, escaped from a farm, stalks over
the plain, and, approaching to within several yards of the train, jogs
along for many miles, and perchance wheedles the engineer into impromptu
races.Hardly has the bird disappeared when on the wide veldt a herd of
buck galloping with their long heads down, or a large number of
wildebeest, plunging and jumping like animated hobby-horses, raise
clouds of dust as they dash away from the monster of iron and steam.Shortly afterward the train passes a waterfall almost thrice as lofty as
Niagara, but located in the middle of the plain, into whose surface the
water has riven a deep and narrow chasm.Since the balmy Indian Ocean has been left behind, the train has been
rising steadily, sometimes an inch in a mile but oftener a hundred feet,
and the air has grown cooler.The thousands of British soldiers at
Ladysmith are wearing heavy clothing; their horses, tethered in the open
air, are shivering, and far to the westward is the cause of it all--the
lofty, snow-covered peaks of the Dragon Mountain.Night comes on and
clothes the craggy mountains and broken valleys with varying shades of
sombreness.The moon outlines the snow far above, and with its rays
marks the lofty line where sky and mountain crest seem to join.Morning
light greets the train as it dashes down the mountain side, through the
passes that connect Natal with the Transvaal and out upon the withered
grass of the flat, uninteresting veldt of the Boer country.The South African veldt in all its winter hideousness lies before you.It stretches out in all directions--to the north and south, to the east
and west--and seems to have no boundaries.Its yellowish brownness eats
into the brain, and the eyes grow weary from the monotony of the scene.Hour after hour the train bears onward in a straight line, but the
landscape remains the same.But for noises and motions of the cars you
would imagine that the train was stationary, so far as change of scenery
is concerned.Occasionally a colony of huge ant-heaps or a few buck or
deer may be passed, but for hours it is veldt, veldt, veldt!An entire
day's journey, unrelieved except toward the end by a few straggling
towns of Boer farmhouses or the sheet-iron cabins of prospectors, bring
it to Heidelberg, once the metropolis as well as the capital of the
republic, but now pining because the former distinguishing mark has been
yielded to its neighbour, Johannesburg.As the shades of another night commence to fall, the veldt suddenly
assumes a new countenance.Lights begin to sparkle, buildings close
together appear, and scores of tall smokestacks tower against the
background of the sky.The presence of the smoke-stacks denote the
arrival at the Randt, and for twenty miles the train rushes along this
well-defined gold-yielding strip of land.Buildings, lights, stacks,
and people become more numerous as the train progresses into the city
limits of Johannesburg, and the traveller soon finds himself in the
middle of a crowd of enthusiastic welcoming and welcomed persons on the
platform of the station of the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche
Spoorweg-Maatschappij, and in the Golden City.The sudden change from the dreary lifelessness of the veldt to the
exciting crush and bustle of the station platform crowd is almost
bewildering, because it is so different from what is expected in
interior Africa.The station, a magnificent structure of stone and
iron, presents more animated scenes whenever trains arrive than the
Grand Central in New York or the Victoria in London, because every
passenger is invariably met at the train by all his friends and as many
of their friends as the station platform will accommodate.The crowd
which surges around this centre of the city's life is of a more
cosmopolitan character than that which can be found in any other city in
the world with the exceptions of Zanzibar and Port Said.Almost every
race is represented in the gathering, which is suggestive of a mass
meeting of the villagers of the Midway Plaisance at the Columbian
Exposition.In the crowd are stolid Anglo-Saxons shaking hands
effusively; enthusiastic Latins embracing each other; <DW64>s rubbing
noses and cheeks; smiling Japanese; cold, stern Chinese; Cingalese,
Russians, Malays, and Egyptians--all in their national costumes, and all
welcoming friends in their native manner and language.Meandering
through the crowd are several keen-eyed Boer policemen, commonly called
"Zarps," politely directing the attention of innocent-looking newcomers
to placards bearing the inscription "Pas op Zakkenrollers," which is the
Boer warning of pickpockets.After the traveller has forced a way through the crowd he is attacked by
a horde of cabmen who can teach tricks of the trade to the London and
New York night-hawks.Their equipages range from dilapidated broughams
to antique 'rickshas, but their charges are the same--"a quid," or five
dollars, either for a mile or a minute's ride.After the insults which
follow a refusal to enter one of their conveyances have subsided, the
agents of the hotels commence a vociferous campaign against the
newcomers, and very clever it is in its way.They are able to
distinguish a foreigner at one glance, and will change the name of the
hotel which they represent a score of times in as many seconds in order
to bag their quarry.For the patriotic American they have the New York
Hotel, the Denver House, the Hotel California, and many other hostelries
named after American cities.they will salute an American,
"Come up to the New York Hotel and patronize American enterprise."If
the traveller will accompany one of these agents he will find that all
the names apply to one hotel, which has an American name but is
conducted and patronized by a low class of foreigners.The victim of
misrepresentation will seek another hotel, and will be fortunate if he
finds comfortable quarters for less than ten dollars a day, or three
times the amount he would be called upon to pay at a far better hotel in
any American city of equal size.The privilege of fasting, or of
awakening in the morning with a layer of dust an eighth of an inch deep
on the counterpane and on the face may be ample return for the
extraordinary charges, but the stranger in the city is not apt to adopt
that view of the situation until he is acclimated.The person who has spent several days in crossing the veldt and enters
Johannesburg by night has a strange revelation before him when he is
awakened the following morning.He has been led to believe that the city
is a motley collection of corrugated-iron hovels, hastily constructed
cabins, and cheap public buildings.Instead he finds a beautiful city,
with well-paved streets, magnificent buildings of stone and brick,
expensive public buildings, and scores of palatial residences.Many
American cities of the same size and many times older can not show as
costly buildings or as fine public works.Hotels of five and six
stories, and occupying, in several instances, almost entire blocks, are
numerous; of office buildings costing a quarter of a million dollars
each there are half a score; banks, shops, and newspapers have three-
and four-story buildings of brick and stone, while there are hundreds of
other buildings that would be creditable to any large city in America or
Europe.The Government Building in the centre of the city is a
five-story granite structure of no mean architectural beauty.In the
suburbs are many magnificent private residences of mine owners and
managers who, although not permanent residents of the city, have
invested large amounts of money, so that the short time they spend in
the country may be amid luxurious and comfortable surroundings.One of the disagreeable features of living in Johannesburg is the dust
which is present everywhere during the dry season.It rises in great,
thick clouds on the surrounding veldt, and, obscuring the sun, wholly
envelops the city in semi-darkness.One minute the air is clear and
there is not a breath of wind; several minutes later a hurricane is
blowing and blankets of dust are falling.The dust clouds generally
rise west of the city, and almost totally eclipse the sun during their
progress over the plain.Sometimes the dust storms continue only a few
minutes, but very frequently the citizens are made uncomfortable by them
for days at a time.Whenever they arrive, the doors and windows of
buildings are tightly closed, business is practically at a standstill,
and every one is miserable.It penetrates
every building, however well protected, and it lodges in the food as
well as in the drink.Pedestrians on the street are unable to see ten
feet ahead, and are compelled to walk with head bowed and with
handkerchief over the mouth and nostrils.Umbrellas and parasols are
but slight protection against it.Only the miners, a thousand feet
below the surface, escape it.When the storm has subsided the entire
city is covered with a blanket of dust ranging in thickness from an inch
on the sidewalks to an eighth of an inch on the store counters,
furniture, and in pantries.It has never been computed how great a
quantity of the dust enters a man's lungs, but the feeling that it
engenders is one of colossal magnitude.Second to the dust, the main characteristic of Johannesburg is the
inhabitants' great struggle for sudden wealth.It is doubtful whether
there is one person in the city whose ambition is less than to become
wealthy in five years at least, and then to return to his native
country.It is not a chase after affluence; it is a stampede in which
every soul in the city endeavours to be in the van.In the city and in
the mines there are hundreds of honourable ways of becoming rich, but
there are thousands of dishonourable ones; and the morals of a mining
city are not always on the highest plane.There are business men of the
strictest probity and honesty, and men whose word is as good as their
bond, but there are many more who will allow their conscience to lie
dormant so long as they remain in the country.With them the passion is
to secure money, and whether they secure it by overcharging a regular
customer, selling illicit gold, or gambling at the stock exchanges is a
matter of small moment.Tradesmen and shopkeepers will charge according
to the apparel of the patron, and will brazenly acknowledge doing so if
reminded by the one who has paid two prices for like articles the same
day.Hotels charge according to the quantity of luggage the traveller
carries, and boarding-houses compute your wealth before presenting their
bills.Street-car fares and postage stamps alone do not fluctuate in
value, but the wise man counts his change.The experiences of an American with one large business house in the city
will serve as an example of the methods of some of those who are eager
to realize their ambitions.The American spent many weeks and much
patience and money in securing photographs throughout the country, and
took the plates to a large firm in Johannesburg for development and
printing.When he returned two weeks later he was informed that the
plates and prints had been delivered a week before, and neither prayers
nor threats secured a different answer.Justice in the courts is slow
and costly, and the American was obliged to leave the country without
his property.Shortly after his departure the firm of photographers
commenced selling a choice collection of new South African photographs
which, curiously, were of the same scenes and persons photographed by
the American.Gambling may be more general in some other cities, but it can not be
more public.The more refined gamblers patronize the two stock
exchanges, and there are but few too poor to indulge in that form of
dissipation.Probably nine tenths of the inhabitants of the city travel
the stock-exchange bypath to wealth or poverty.Women and boys are as
much infected by the fever as mine owners and managers, and it would not
be slandering the citizens to say that one fourth of the conversation
heard on the streets refers to the rise and fall of stocks.The popular gathering place in the city is the street in front of one of
the stock exchanges known as "The Chains."During the session of the
exchange the street is crowded with an excited throng of men, boys, and
even women, all flushed with the excitement of betting on the rise and
fall of mining stocks in the building.Clerks, office boys, and miners
spend the lunch hour at "The Chains," either to invest their wages or to
watch the market if their money is already invested.A fall in the
value of stocks is of far greater moment to them than war, famine, or
pestilence.The passion for gambling is also satisfied by a giant lottery scheme
known as "Sweepstakes," which has the sanction of the Government.Thousands of pounds are offered as prizes at the periodical drawings,
and no true Johannesburger ever fails to secure at least one ticket for
the drawing.When there are no sessions of the stock exchanges, no
sweepstakes, horse races, ball games, or other usual opportunities for
gambling, they will bet on the arrival of the Cape train, the length of
a sermon, or the number of lashes a <DW64> criminal can endure before
fainting.Drinking is a second diversion which occupies much of the time of the
average citizen, because of the great heat and the lack of amusement.The liquor that is drunk in Johannesburg in one year would make a stream
of larger proportions and far more healthier contents than the Vaal
River in the dry season.It is a rare occurrence to see a man drink
water unless it is concealed in brandy, and at night it is even rarer
that one is seen who is not drinking.Cape Smoke, the name given to a
liquor made in Cape Colony, is credited with the ability to kill a man
before he has taken the glass from his lips, but the popular Uitlander
beverage, brandy and soda, is even more fatal in its effects.Pure
liquor is almost unobtainable, and death-dealing counterfeits from
Delagoa Bay are the substitutes.Twenty-five cents for a glass of beer
and fifty cents for brandy and soda are not deterrent prices where
ordinary mine workers receive ten dollars a day and mine managers fifty
thousand dollars a year.Of social life there is little except such as is afforded by the clubs,
of which there are several of high standing.The majority of the men
left their families in their native countries on account of the severe
climate, and that fact, combined with the prevalent idea that the
weather is too torrid to do anything unnecessary, is responsible for
Johannesburg's lack of social amenity.There are occasional dances and
receptions, but they are participated in only by newcomers who have not
yet fallen under the spell of the South African sun.The Sunday night's
musical entertainments at the Wanderer's Club are practically the only
affairs to which the average Uitlander cares to go, because he can
clothe himself for comfort and be as dignified or as undignified as he
pleases.The true Johannesburger is the most independent man in the world.When
he meets a native on the sidewalk he promptly kicks him into the street,
and if the action is resented, bullies a Boer policeman into arresting
the offender.The policeman may demur and call the Johannesburger a
"Verdomde rooinek," but he will make the arrest or receive a drubbing.He may be arrested in turn, but he is ever willing and anxious to pay a
fine for the privilege of beating a "dumb Dutchman," as he calls him.He pays little attention to the laws of the country, because he has not
had the patience to learn what they consist of, and he rests content in
knowing that his home government will rescue him through diplomatic
channels if he should run counter to the laws.He cares nothing
concerning the government of the city except as it interferes with or
assists his own private interests, but he will take advantage of every
opportunity to defy the authority of the administrators of the laws.He
despises the Boers, and continually and maliciously ridicules them on
the slightest pretexts.Specially true is this of those newspapers
which are the representatives of the Uitlander population.Venomous
editorials against the Boer Government and people appear almost daily,
and serve to widen the breach between the two classes of inhabitants.The Boer newspapers for a long time ignored the assaults of the
Uitlander press, but recently they have commenced to retaliate, and the
editorial war is a bitter one.An extract from the Randt Post will show
the nature and depth of bitterness displayed by the two classes of
newspapers:

"Though Dr.Leyds may be right, and the Johannesburg population safe in
case of war, we advise that, at the first act of war on the English
side, the women and children, and well-disposed persons of this town, be
given twenty-four hours to leave, and then the whole place be shot down;
in the event, we repeat--which God forbid!--of war coming."If, indeed, there must be shooting, then it will be on account of
seditious words and deeds of Johannesburg agitators and the
co-shareholders in Cape Town and London, and the struggle will be
promoted for no other object than the possession of the gold.Well,
then, let such action be taken that the perpetrators of these turbulent
proceedings shall, if caught, be thrown into the deep shafts of their
mines, with the debris of the batteries for a costly shroud, and that
the whole of Johannesburg, with the exception of the Afrikander wards,
be converted into a gigantic rubbish heap to serve as a mighty tombstone
for the shot-down authors of a monstrous deed."If it be known that these valuable buildings and the lives of the
wire-pullers are the price of the mines, then people will take good heed
before the torch of war is set alight.Friendly talks and protests are
no use with England.Let force and rough violence be opposed to the
intrigues and plots of Old England, and only then will the Boer remain
master."It is on Saturday nights that the bitterness of the Uitlander population
is most noticeable, since then the workers from the mines along the
Randt gather in the city and discuss their grievances, which then become
magnified with every additional glass of liquor.It is then that the
city streets and places of amusement and entertainment are crowded with
a throng that finds relaxation by abusing the Boers.The theatre
audiences laugh loudest at the coarsest jests made at the expense of the
Boers, and the bar-room crowds talk loudest when the Boers are the
subject of discussion.The abuse continues even when the not-too-sober
Uitlander, wheeled homeward at day-break by his faithful Zulu 'ricksha
boy, casts imprecations upon the Boer policeman who is guarding his
property.Johannesburg is one of the most expensive places of residence in the
world.Situated in the interior of the continent, thousands of miles
distant from the sources of food and supplies, it is natural that
commodities should be high in price.Almost all food stuffs are carried
thither from America, Europe, and Australia, and consequently the
original cost is trebled by the addition of carriage and customs duties.The most common articles of food are twice as costly as in America,
while such commodities as eggs, imported from Madeira, frequently are
scarce at a dollar a dozen.Butter from America is fifty cents a pound,
and fruits and vegetables from Cape Colony and Natal are equally high in
price and frequently unobtainable.Good board can not be obtained
anywhere for less than five dollars a day, while the best hotels and
clubs charge thrice that amount.Rentals are exceptionally high owing
to the extraordinary land values and the cost of erecting buildings.A
small, brick-lined, corrugated-iron cottage of four rooms, such as a
married mine-employee occupies, costs from fifty to seventy-five dollars
a month, while a two-story brick house in a respectable quarter of the
city rents for one hundred dollars a month.Every object in the city is mutely expressive of a vast expenditure of
money.The idea that everything--the buildings, food, horses, clothing,
machinery, and all that is to be seen--has been carried across oceans
and continents unconsciously associates itself with the cost that it has
entailed.Four-story buildings that in New York or London would be
passed without remark cause mental speculation concerning their cost,
merely because it is so patent that every brick, nail, and board in them
has been conveyed thousands of miles from foreign shores.Electric
lights and street cars, so common in American towns, appear abnormal in
the city in the veldt, and instantly suggest an outlay of great amounts
of money even to the minds which are not accustomed to reducing
everything to dollars and pounds.Leaving the densely settled centre of
the city, where land is worth as much as choice plots on Broadway, and
wandering into the suburbs where the great mines are, the idea of cost
is more firmly implanted into the mind.The huge buildings, covering
acres of ground and thousands of tons of the most costly machinery, seem
to be of natural origin rather than of human handiwork.It is almost
beyond belief that men should be daring enough to convey hundreds of
steamer loads of lumber and machinery halfway around the world at
inestimable cost merely for the yellow metal that Nature has hidden so
far distant from the great centres of population.The cosmopolitanism of the city is a feature which impresses itself most
indelibly upon the mind.In a half-day's stroll in the city
representatives of all the peoples of the earth, with the possible
exception of the American Indian, Eskimos, and South Sea islanders, will
be seen variously engaged in the struggle for gold.On the floors of the
stock exchanges are money barons or their agents, as energetic and sharp
as their prototypes of Wall and Throckmorton Streets.These are chiefly
British, French, and German.Outside, between "The Chains," are readily
discernible the distinguishing features of the Americans, Afrikanders,
Portuguese, Russians, Spaniards, and Italians.A few steps distant is
Commissioner Street, the principal thoroughfare, where the surging
throng is composed of so many different racial representatives that an
analysis of it is not an easy undertaking.He is considered an expert
who can name the native country of every man on the street, and if he
can distinguish between an American and a Canadian he is credited with
being a wise man.In the throng is the tall, well-clothed Briton, with silk hat and frock
coat, closely followed by a sparsely clad Matabele, bearing his master's
account books or golf-sticks.Near them a Chinaman, in circular
red-topped hat and flowing silk robes, is having a heated argument in
broken English with an Irish hansom-driver.Crossing the street are two
stately Arabs, in turbans and white robes, jostling easy-going Indian
coolies with their canes.Bare-headed Cingalese, their long, shiny hair
tied in knots and fastened down with circular combs, noiselessly gliding
along, or stopping suddenly to trade Oriental jewelry for Christian's
money; Malays, Turks, Egyptians, Persians, and New-Zealanders, each with
his distinctive costume; Hottentots, Matabeles, Zulus, Mashonas,
Basutos, and the representatives of hundreds of the other native races
south of the Zambezi pass by in picturesque lack of bodily adornment.It is an imposing array, too, for the majority of the throng is composed
of moderately wealthy persons, and even in the centre of Africa wealth
carries with it opportunities for display.John Chinaman will ride in a
'ricksha to his joss-house with as much conscious pride as the European
or American will sit in his brougham or automobile.Money is as easily
spent as made in Johannesburg, and it is a cosmopolitan habit to spend
it in a manner so that everybody will know it is being spent.To make a
display of some sort is necessary to the citizen's happiness.If he is
not of sufficient importance to have his name in the subsidized
newspapers daily he will seek notoriety by wearing a thousand pounds'
worth of diamonds on the street or making astonishing bets at the
race-track.In that little universe on the veldt every man tries to be
superior to his neighbour in some manner that may be patent to all the
city.When it is taken into consideration that almost all the
contestants were among the cleverest and shrewdest men in the countries
whence they came to Johannesburg, and not among the riffraff and
failures, then the intensity of the race for superiority can be
imagined.Johannesburg might be named the City of Surprises.Its youthful
existence has been fraught with astonishing works.It was born in a
day, and one day's revolution almost ended its existence.It grew from
the desert veldt into a garden of gold.Its granite residences, brick
buildings, and iron and steel mills sprang from blades of grass and
sprigs of weeds.It has transformed the beggar into a millionaire, and
it has seen starving men in its streets.It harbours men from every
nation and climate, but it is a home for few.It is far from the centre
of the earth's civilization, but it has often attracted the whole
world's attention.It supports its children, but by them it is cursed.Its god is in the earth upon which it rests, and its hope of future life
in that which it brings forth.And all this because a man upturned the
soil and called it gold.In the first place,
despite all efforts, the girl could not be brought to a proper
sense of money values.Her eyes were ever gaping in astonishment at
what Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister regarded as the most moderate
of expenditures, and it was only when the Beaubien herself mildly
hinted to them that ingenuousness was one of the girl's greatest
social assets, that they learned to smile indulgently at her wonder,
even while inwardly pitying her dense ignorance and lack of
sophistication.A second source of trial to her guardians was her delicate sense of
honor; and it was this that one day nearly sufficed to wreck their
standing with the fashionable Mrs.Gannette of Riverside Drive, a
pompous, bepowdered, curled and scented dame, anaemic of mind, but
tremendously aristocratic, and of scarcely inferior social dignity to
that of the envied Mrs.Gannette moved into the
neighborhood where dwelt the ambitious Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the latter
was taken by a mutual acquaintance to call upon her, and was
immediately received into the worldly old lady's good graces.And it
so happened that, after the gay season had closed that summer, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister to an informal
afternoon of bridge, and especially requested that they bring their
young ward, whose beauty and wonderful story were, through the
discreet maneuvers of her guardians, beginning to be talked about.Hawley-Crowles had been inducting Carmen
into the mysteries of the game; but with indifferent success, for the
girl's thoughts invariably were elsewhere engaged.On this particular
afternoon Carmen was lost in contemplation of the gorgeous dress, the
lavish display of jewelry, and the general inanity of conversation;
and her score was pitiably low.The following morning, to her great
astonishment, she received a bill from the practical Mrs.Gannette for
ten dollars to cover her losses at the game.For a long time the
bewildered girl mused over it.Then she called the chauffeur and
despatched him to the Gannette mansion with the money necessary to
meet the gambling debt, and three dollars additional to pay for the
refreshments she had eaten, accompanying it with a polite little note
of explanation.The result was an explosion that nearly lifted the asphalt from the
Drive; and Carmen, covered with tears and confusion, was given to
understand by the irate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles that her conduct was as
reprehensible as if she had attacked the eminent Mrs.Whereupon the sorrowing Carmen packed her effects and prepared to
depart from the presence of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, to the terrified
consternation of the latter, who alternately prostrated herself before
the girl and the offended Mrs.Gannette, and at length, after many
days of perspiring effort and voluminous explanation, succeeded in
restoring peace.When the Beaubien, who had become the girl's confidante, learned the
story, she laughed till her sides ached.And then her lips set, and
her face grew terribly hard, and she muttered, "Fools!"But she smiled
again as she gathered the penitent girl in her arms, and kissed her."You will learn many things, dearie, before you are through with New
York.And," she added, her brow again clouding, "you _will_ be through
with it--some day!"That evening she repeated the story at her table, and Gannette, who
happened to be present, swore between roars of laughter that he would
use it as a club over his wife, should she ever again trap him in any
of his numerous indiscretions.Again, the girl's odd views of life and its meaning which, despite her
efforts, she could not refrain from voicing now and then, caused the
worldly Mrs.Hawley-Crowles much consternation.Carmen tried
desperately to be discreet.Even Harris advised her to listen much,
but say little; and she strove hard to obey.But she would forget and
hurl the newspapers from her with exclamations of horror over their
red-inked depictions of mortal frailty--she would flatly refuse to
discuss crime or disease--and she would comment disparagingly at too
frequent intervals on the littleness of human aims and the emptiness
of the peacock-life which she saw manifested about her."I don't
understand--I can't," she would say, when she was alone with the
Beaubien."Why, with the wonderful opportunities which you rich people
have, how can you--oh, how can you toss them aside for the frivolities
and littleness that you all seem to be striving for!It seems to me
you must be mad--_loco_!And I know you are, for you are simply
mesmerized!"Then the Beaubien would smile knowingly and take her in her arms."We
shall see," she would often say, "we shall see."Thus the summer months sped swiftly past, with Carmen ever looking and
listening, receiving, sifting, in, but not of, the new world into
which she had been cast.In a sense her existence was as narrowly
routined as ever it had been in Simiti, for her days were spent at the
great organ, with frequent rides in the automobile through the parks
and boulevards for variation; and her evenings were jealously guarded
by Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose policy was to keep the girl in seclusion
until the advent of her formal introduction to the world of
fashionable society, when her associates would be selected only from
the narrow circle of moneyed or titled people with whom alone she
might mingle.To permit her to form promiscuous acquaintances now
might prove fatal to the scheming woman's cherished plans, and was a
risk that could not be entertained.And Carmen, suppressing her
wonder, and striving incessantly to curb her ready tongue, accepted
her environment as the unreal expression of the human mind, and
submitted--and waited.CHAPTER 10

The chill blasts had begun to swoop down from the frozen North, and
summer had gathered her dainty robes about her and fled shivering
before them.Hawley-Crowles stood at a window and gazed with
unseeing eyes at the withered leaves tossing in the wind.Carmen's sixteenth birthday was past by some months; the gay season
was at hand; and the day was speeding toward her which she had set for
the girl's formal _debut_.Already, through informal calls and
gatherings, she had made her charming and submissive ward known to
most of her own city acquaintances and the members of her particular
set.The fresh, beautiful girl's winning personality; her frank,
ingenuous manner; her evident sincerity and her naive remarks, which
now only gave hints of her radical views, had opened every heart wide
to her, and before the advent of the social season her wonderful story
was on everybody's tongue.There remained now only the part which the
woman had planned for the Beaubien, but which, thus far, she had found
neither the courage nor the opportunity to suggest to that influential
woman.Gazing out into the deserted street, she stamped her ample foot
in sheer vexation.The Beaubien had absorbed Carmen; had been
politely affable to her and her sister; had called twice during the
summer; and had said nothing.The
hint must come from the other side; and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles could have
wept with chagrin as she reflected gloomily on her own timorous
spirit.But as she stood in dejection before the window a vague idea flitted
into her brain, and she clutched at it desperately.Carmen had spoken
of the frequent calls of a certain Monsignor Lafelle at the Beaubien
mansion, although the girl had never met him."Old Gaspard de Beaubien was a
French Catholic."Nothing--except--why, to be sure,
the girl came from a Catholic country, and therefore was a Catholic!That was worth developing a little
further."Let us see," she reflected, "Kathleen Ames is coming out
this winter, too.Candidate for her mother's
social position, of course.The Reverend Darius Borwell, D.D., L.L.D., and any other D. that will
keep him glued to his ten-thousand-dollar salary, hooked them early in
the game.Now suppose--suppose Lafelle should tell the Beaubien
that--that there's--no, that won't do!But suppose I tell him that
here's a chance for him to back a Catholic against a Protestant for
the highest social honors in New York--Carmen versus Kathleen--what
would he say?I'm just as good a Catholic as Protestant.And Catholic, Methodist, or Hard-shell
Baptist, as suited his needs.Suppose I should tip
it off to Lafelle that I'm smitten with the pious intention of
donating an altar to Holy Saints Cathedral in memory of my late,
unlamented consort--what then?Yes,
it's not a bad idea at all."And thus it was that a few days later Mrs.Hawley-Crowles timed it so
carefully that she chanced to call on the Beaubien with Carmen shortly
after Monsignor Lafelle's car had pulled up at the same door.It was
the merest accident, too, that Carmen led her puffing guardian
directly into the morning room, where sat the Beaubien and Monsignor
in earnest conversation.Hawley-Crowles would have retired at
once, stammering apologies, and reprimanding Carmen for her assumption
of liberties in another's house; but the Beaubien was grace and
cordiality itself, and she insisted on retaining her three callers and
making them mutually acquainted.Hawley-Crowles found it easy to take
the contemplated plunge.Therefore she smiled triumphantly when, a
week later, Monsignor Lafelle alighted at her own door, in response to
a summons on matters pertaining to the Church."But, Madam," replied the holy man, after carefully listening to her
announcement, "I can only refer the matter to the Bishop.I am not
connected with this diocese.But I
shall be most pleased to lay it before him, with my endorsement.""As you say, Monsignor," sweetly responded the gracious Mrs."I sought your advice because I had met you through my
dear friend, Madam Beaubien.""It has been a great pleasure to know you and to be of service to you,
Madam," said Monsignor, rising to depart."But," he added with a
tender smile, "a pleasure that would be enhanced were you to become
one of us."Hawley-Crowles knew that at last the time had come."A moment,
please, Monsignor," she said, her heart beating quickly.It concerns my ward, the young girl
whom you met at Madam Beaubien's.""And just
budding into still more beautiful womanhood."Then she threw herself precipitately into her
topic, as if she feared further delay would result in the evaporation
of her boldness."Monsignor, it is, as you say, unfortunate that I
profess no religious convictions; and yet, as I have told you, I find
that as the years pass I lean ever more strongly toward your Church.Now you will pardon me when I say that I am sure it is the avowed
intention to make America dominantly Catholic that brings you to this
country to work toward that end--is it not so?"The man's handsome face lighted up pleasantly, but he did not reply."Now, Monsignor, I am going to be terribly frank; and if you
disapprove of what I suggest, we will both forget that the matter was
ever under discussion.To begin with, I heartily endorse your
missionary efforts in this godless country of ours.Nothing but the
strong arm of the Catholic Church, it seems to me, can check our
headlong plunge into ruin.But, Monsignor, you do not always work
where your labors are most needed.You may control political--"

"My dear lady," interrupted the man, holding up a hand and shaking his
head in gentle demurral, "the Catholic Church is not in politics.""But it is in society--or should be!""And
if the Catholic Church is to be supreme in America it must work from
the top down, as well as from the lower levels upward.At present our
wealthiest, most influential social set is absolutely domineered by a
Protestant--and under the influence of a Presbyterian minister at
that!Monsignor Lafelle's eyes twinkled, as he listened politely.But he
only stroked the white hair that crowned his shapely head, and
waited."Monsignor," continued the now thoroughly heated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles,
"why do not the women of your Church constitute our society leaders?Why do you not recognize the desirability of forcing your people into
every avenue of human activity?And would you resent a suggestion from
me as to how in one instance this might be accomplished?""Certainly not, Madam," replied Monsignor, with an expression of
wonder on his face."You are laughing at me, I do believe!"she exclaimed, catching the
glint in his gray eyes."Pardon me, dear lady, I really am deeply interested."Well, at any rate I have your promise to forget this conversation if
you do not approve of it," she said quizzically.He nodded his head to inspire her confidence; and she continued:

"Very well, now to the point.My ward, the little Inca princess, is
coming out shortly.I want her to have the _entree_ into the very best
society, into the most fashionable and exclusive set, as befitting her
rank."She stopped and awaited the effect of her words.Monsignor studied her for a moment, and then broke into a genial
laugh."There is nothing reprehensible in your wish, Madam," he said."Our social system, however imperfect, nevertheless exists,
and--dominant Catholic influence might improve it."Why, I really see nothing that I can do," he replied slowly.Hawley-Crowles was becoming exasperated with his apparent
dullness."You can do much," she retorted in a tone tinctured with
impatience."Since I have made you my Father Confessor to-day, I am
going to tell you that I intend to start a social war that will rip
this city wide open.It is going to be war in which Catholic is pitted
against Protestant.For a moment her blunt question startled him, and he stared at her
uncomprehendingly; but he quickly recovered his poise and replied
calmly, "Neither, Madam; it remains quite neutral.""Pardon me if I say it; not at all."she murmured, her eagerness subsiding."Then I've made an awful
mistake!""No," he amended gently, "you have made a good friend.And, as such, I
again urge you first to respect the leaning which you mentioned a
moment ago and become actively affiliated with our Church here in New
York."Certainly I will consider it," she responded, brightening with hope."And I will go so far as to say that I have long had it in mind.""Then, Madam, when that is accomplished, we may discuss the less
important matter of your ward's entrance into society--is it not so?"Hawley-Crowles rose, completely discomfited."But the girl,
Monsignor, is already a Catholic--comes from a Catholic country.It is
she whom I am pitting against the Protestant.""You are cruel," she retorted, affecting an air of injured innocence
as she stood before him with downcast eyes."But--if you--"

"Madam," said Monsignor, "plainly, what is it that you wish me to
do?"The sudden propounding of the question drew an equally sudden but less
thoughtful response."Tell the Beau--Madam Beaubien that you wish my ward to be received
into the best society, and for the reasons I have given you."And is my influence with Madam Beaubien, and hers with the members of
fashionable society, sufficient to effect that?"he asked, an odd look
coming into his eyes."She has but to say the word to J. Wilton Ames, and his wife will
receive us both," said the woman, carried away by her eagerness."And
that means strong Catholic influence in New York's most aristocratic
set!""Monsignor," continued the woman eagerly, "will your Church receive an
altar from me in memory of my late husband?"Then, slowly, and in a low, earnest tone, "It
would receive such a gift from one of the faith.When may we expect
you to become a communicant?"The woman paled, and her heart suddenly chilled.She had wondered how
far she might go with this clever churchman, and now she knew that she
had gone too far.But to retract--to have him relate this conversation
and her retraction to the Beaubien--were fatal!She had set her
trap--and walked into it.Then,
raising her eyes and meeting his searching glance, she murmured
feebly, "Whenever you say, Monsignor."When the man had departed, which he did immediately, the plotting
woman threw herself upon the davenport and wept with rage."Belle,"
she wailed, as her wondering sister entered the room, "I'm going to
join the Catholic Church!But I'd go through Sheol to beat that Ames
outfit!"CHAPTER 11


MONSIGNOR LAFELLE made another afternoon call on the Beaubien a few
days later.That lady, fresh from her bath, scented, powdered, and
charming in a loose, flowing Mandarin robe, received him graciously."But I can give you only a moment, Monsignor," she said, waving him to
a chair, while she stooped and tenderly took up the two spaniels."I
have a dinner to-night, and so shall not listen unless you have
something fresh and really worth while to offer.""My dear Madam," said he, bowing low before he sank into the great
leather armchair, "you are charming, and the Church is justly proud of
you.""Tut, tut, my friend," she returned, knitting her brows."That may be
fresh, I admit, but not worth listening to.And if you persist in that
vein I shall be obliged to have William set you into the street.""I can not apologize for voicing the truth, dear Madam," he replied,
as his eyes roved admiringly over her comely figure."The Church has
never ceased to claim you, however far you may have wandered from her.I am leaving for Canada shortly on a mission of
some importance.May I not take with me the consoling assurance that
you have at last heard and yielded to the call of the tender Mother,
who has never ceased to yearn for her beautiful, wayward daughter?""There," she said gently, "I thought
that was it.No, Monsignor, no," shaking her head."When only a wild,
thoughtless girl I became a Catholic in order that I might marry
Gaspard de Beaubien.The priest urged; and I--<DW30>!But
the past eighteen years have confirmed me in some views; and one is
that I shall gain nothing, either here or hereafter, by renewing my
allegiance to the Church of Rome."Monsignor sighed, and stroked his abundant white hair."I learned this morning," he said musingly, "that my
recent labors with the Dowager Duchess of Altern in England have not
been vain.She has become a communicant of Holy Church.""The Duchess of Altern--sister of Mrs.Why, she was a high Anglican--"

"Only a degree below the true Church, Madam.Her action is but
anticipatory of a sweeping return of the entire Anglican Church to the
true fold.And I learn further," he went on, "that the Duchess will
spend the winter in New York with her sister.Which means, of course,
an unusually gay season here, does it not?"The Beaubien quickly recovered from her astonishment."Well,
Monsignor," she laughed, "for once you really are interesting.Ames herself will be the next
convert?But one of your most intimate friends will
become a communicant of Holy Saints next Sunday."The Beaubien set the spaniels down
on the floor."Now, my dear Monsignor, you are positively refreshing."Am I not right when I insist that you have
wandered far, dear Madam?It is not 'he,' but'she,' your dear friend,
Mrs.The Beaubien's mouth opened wide and she sat suddenly upright and
gazed blankly at her raconteur.The man went on, apparently oblivious
of the effect his information had produced."Her beautiful ward, who
is to make her bow to society this winter, is one of us by birth.""Then you have been at work on Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward, have
you?"said the Beaubien severely, and there was a threatening note in
her voice."Why," returned Monsignor easily, "the lady sent for me to express her
desire to become affiliated with the Church.And I
have had no conversation with the girl, I assure you."Then:

"Will you tell me why, Monsignor, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles takes this
unusual step?"Is it unusual, Madam, for a woman who has seen much of the
world to turn from it to the solace and promise of the Church?"Hawley-Crowles it
is, decidedly."Monsignor, I do not.And by this time you
do, too.She is the last woman in the world to turn from it.""But the question you have just propounded reflects seriously upon
both the Church and me--"

"Bah!"interjected the Beaubien, her eyes flashing."Wait," she
commanded imperiously, as he rose."I have a few things to say to you,
since this is to be your last call.""Madam, not the last, I hope.For I shall not cease to plead the cause
of the Church to you--"

"Surely, Monsignor, that is your business.You are welcome in my
house at any time, and particularly when you have such delightful
scraps of gossip as these which you have brought to-day.But, a word
before you go, lest you become indiscreet on your return.Hawley-Crowles to any extent you wish, but let her ward
alone--_absolutely_!The cold, even tone in which the woman said this left no doubt in the
man's mind of her meaning.She was not trifling with him now, he knew.In her low-voiced words he found no trace of banter, of sophistry, nor
of aught that he might in any wise misinterpret."Now, Monsignor, I have some influence in New York, as you may
possibly know.Will you admit that I can do much for or against you?Drop your mask, therefore, and tell me frankly just what has induced
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to unite with your Church."The man knew he was pitting his own against a master mind.He
hesitated and weighed well his words before replying."Madam," said he
at length, with a note of reproach, "you misjudge the lady, the
Church, and me, its humble servant.Hawley-Crowles, I speak truly when I say that doubtless she
has been greatly influenced by love for her late husband."The Beaubien half rose from her chair."Jim Crowles--that raw,
Irish boob, who was holding down a job on the police force until Ames
found he could make a convenient tool of him!The man who was
Gannette's cat's-paw in the Fall River franchise steal!Now,
Monsignor, would you have me believe you devoid of all sense?""But," ejaculated the man, now becoming exasperated, and for the
moment so losing his self-control as to make wretched use of his
facts, "she is erecting an altar in Holy Saints as a memorial to
him!"Monsignor Lafelle again made as if to rise.He felt that he was guilty
of a miserable _faux pas_."Madam, I regret that I must be leaving.But the hour--"

"Stay, Monsignor!"The Beaubien roused up and laid a detaining hand
upon his arm."Our versatile friend, what other projects has she in
hand?"Why, really, I can not say--beyond the fact that the girl is to be
introduced to society this winter."Going to make a try for the Ames set?""That, I believe, Madam, would be useless without your aid."Hawley-Crowles say so, Monsignor?"demanded the woman,
leaning forward eagerly."Why, I believe I am not abusing her confidence when I say that she
intimated as much," he said, watching her closely and sparring now
with better judgment.Ames as New York's
fashionable society leader--"

"There is no such position as leader in New York society, Monsignor,"
interrupted the Beaubien coldly."There are sets and cliques, and
Mrs.Ames happens to be prominent in the one which at present
foolishly imagines it constitutes the upper stratum.Hawley-Crowles, with nothing but a tarnished name and a large bank
account to recommend her, now wishes to break into that clique and
attain social leadership, does she?Then the woman's eyes narrowed and grew hard.Leaning closer to
the churchman, she rested the tip of her finger on his knee."So, Monsignor," she said, with cold precision, "this is Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's method of renouncing the world, is it?And she would use both you and me, eh?And you are her ambassador
at the court of the Beaubien?Very well, then, she shall use us.But you and I will first make this compact, my dear Monsignor:
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles shall be taken into the so-called 'Ames set,'
and you shall cease importuning me to return to your Church, and
what is more, shall promise to have no conversation on church
matters with her ward, the young girl.If you do not agree to
this, Monsignor, I shall set in motion forces that will make your
return to New York quite undesirable."When she concluded, she
looked long and steadily into his eyes.Monsignor got slowly to his feet.he exclaimed in a hoarse
whisper, "my astonishment--"

"There," she said calmly, as she rose and took his hand, "please omit
the dramatics, Monsignor.And now you must go, for to-night I
entertain, and I have already given you more time than I intended.But, Monsignor, do you in future work with or against me?"Why, Madam," he replied quickly, "we could never be the latter!""And you always respect the wishes of a friend, especially if she is a
lady, do you not?""Always, Madam," he returned after a moment's hesitation, as he bowed
low over her hand.And, Monsignor," she added, when he reached the door,
"I shall be pleased to attend the dedication of the Hawley-Crowles
altar."When Monsignor's car glided away from her door the Beaubien's face
grew dark, and her eyes drew to narrow slits."So," she reflected, as
she entered the elevator to mount to her dressing room, "that is her
game, is it?The poor, fat simpleton has no interest in either the
girl or myself, other than to use us as stepping-stones.She forgets
that a stone sometimes turns under the foot.She entered her room and rang for her maid.Turning to the pier glass,
she threw on the electric light and scrutinized her features narrowly."It's going," she murmured, "fast!Oh, what a farce life is--what a howling, mocking farce!No--that little girl--if it is possible
for me to love, I love her.""I wonder what it is she does to me.I'm
hypnotized, I guess.Anyhow, I'm different when I'm with her.And to
think that Hawley-Crowles would sacrifice the child--humph!But, if
the girl is made of the right stuff--and I know she is--she will stand
up under it and be stronger for the experience.She has got something
that will make her stand!I once asked her what she had that I didn't,
and now I know--it is her religion, the religion that Borwell and
Lafelle and the whole kit of preachers and priests would corrupt if
they had half a chance!Very well, we'll see what it does under the
test.If it saves her, then I want it myself.But, as for that little
pin-headed Hawley-Crowles, she's already signed her own death-warrant.She shall get into the Ames set, yes.And I will use her, oh,
beautifully!to pay off certain old scores against Madam Ames--and
then I'll crush her like a dried leaf, the fat fool!"The Beaubien's position was, to say the least, peculiar, and one which
required infinite tact on her part to protect.It was for that reason
that the decorum which prevailed at her dinners was so rigidly
observed, and that, whatever the moral status of the man who sat at
her board, his conduct was required to be above reproach, on penalty
of immediate ejection from the circle of financial pirates, captains
of commercial jugglery, and political intriguers who made these feasts
opportunities for outlining their predatory campaigns against that
most anomalous of creatures, the common citizen.It was about this table, at whose head always sat the richly gowned
Beaubien, that the inner circle of financial kings had gathered almost
nightly for years to rig the market, determine the price of wheat or
cotton, and develop mendacious schemes of stock-jobbery whose golden
harvests they could calculate almost to a dollar before launching.As
the wealth of this clique of financial manipulators swelled beyond all
bounds, so increased their power, until at last it could be justly
said that, when Ames began to dominate the Stock Exchange, the
Beaubien practically controlled Wall Street--and, therefore, in a
sense, Washington itself.But always with a tenure of control
dubiously dependent upon the caprices of the men who continued to pay
homage to her personal charm and keen, powerful intellect.At the time of which we speak her power was at its zenith, and she
could with equal impunity decapitate the wealthiest, most aristocratic
society dame, or force the door of the most exclusive set for any
protegee who might have been kept long years knocking in vain, or
whose family name, perchance, headed a list of indictments for gross
peculations.At these unicameral meetings, held in the great, dark,
mahogany-wainscoted dining room of the Beaubien mansion, where a
single lamp of priceless workmanship threw a flood of light upon the
sumptuous table beneath and left the rest of the closely guarded room
shrouded in Stygian darkness, plans were laid and decrees adopted
which seated judges, silenced clergymen, elected senators, and
influenced presidents.There a muck-raking, hostile press was muffled.There business opposition was crushed and competition throttled.There
tax rates were determined and tariff schedules formulated.There
public opinion was disrupted, character assassinated, and the
death-warrant of every threatening reformer drawn and signed.In a
word, there Mammon, in the _role_ of business, organized and
unorganized, legitimate and piratical, sat enthroned, with wires
leading into every mart of the world, and into every avenue of human
endeavor, be it social, political, commercial, or religious.These
wires were gathered together into the hands of one man, the directing
genius of the group, J. Wilton Ames.Over him lay the shadow of the
Beaubien.An hour after the departure of Monsignor Lafelle the Beaubien, like a
radiant sun, descended to the library to greet her assembled guests.Some moments later the heavy doors of the great dining room swung
noiselessly open, and the lady proceeded unescorted to her position at
the head of the table.At her signal the half dozen men sat down, and
the butler immediately entered, followed by two serving men with the
cocktails and the first course.The chair at the far end of the table,
opposite the Beaubien, remained unoccupied."Ames is late to-night," observed the girthy Gannette, glancing toward
the vacant seat, and clumsily attempting to tuck his napkin into his
collar.The Beaubien looked sharply at him."Were you at the club this
afternoon, Mr.Gannette straightened up and became rigid.Pulling the napkin down
hastily, he replied in a thick voice, "Just a little game of
bridge--some old friends--back from Europe--"

The Beaubien turned to the butler.Gannette is not
drinking wine this evening."The butler bowed and removed the glasses
from that gentleman's place."Now, Lucile--" he began peevishly.The Beaubien held up a hand.Gannette glowered and sank down in his
chair like a swollen toad."May be Ames is trying to break into the C. and R. directors'
meeting," suggested Weston, himself a director in a dozen companies,
and a bank president besides."They tell me," said Fitch, "that for once Ames has been outwitted,
and that by a little bucket-shop broker named Ketchim."queried Kane, Board of Trade plunger, and the most
mettlesome speculator of the group."Why," explained Weston, "some months ago Ames tried to reach Ed.Stolz through Ketchim, the old man's nephew, and get control of C. and
R. But friend nephew dropped the portcullis just as Ames was dashing
across the drawbridge, and J. Wilton found himself outside, looking
through the bars.First time I've ever known that to happen.Now the
boys have got hold of it on 'Change, and Ames has been getting it from
every quarter.""Long time leaking out, seems to me," remarked Kane."But what's Ames
going to do about it?""He seems to have dropped the
matter.""I think you will find yourself mistaken," put in the Beaubien
evenly.queried Fitch, as all eyes turned upon the woman.Ames always gets what he goes
after, and he will secure control of C. and R.vigorously asserted Murdock, who had been an
interested listener."I have one thousand dollars that says he will," said the Beaubien,
calmly regarding the speaker.Murdock seemed taken back for the moment; but lost no time recovering
his poise.Drawing out his own book he wrote a check in the Beaubien's
name for the amount and sent it down the table to her.Fitch will hold the stakes," said the woman, handing him the two
slips of paper."And we will set a time limit of eighteen months.""By the way," remarked Peele, the only one of the group who had taken
no part in the preceding conversation, "I see by the evening paper
that there's been another accident in the Avon mills.Fellow named
Marcus caught in a machine and crushed all out of shape.That's the
third one down there this month.They'll force Ames to equip his mills
with safety devices if this keeps up.""Not while the yellow metal has any influence upon the Legislature,"
returned the Beaubien with a knowing smile."But," she added more
seriously, "that is not where the danger lies.The real source of
apprehension is in the possibility of a strike.And if war breaks out
among those Hungarians down there it will cost him more than to equip
all his mills now with safety devices."Gannette, who had been sulking in his chair, roused up."Speaking
of war," he growled, "has Ames, or any of you fellows, got a
finger in the muddle in South America?I've got interests down
there--concessions and the like--and by--!"He wandered off into
incoherent mutterings.The Beaubien gave a sharp command to the butler.cried Gannette, his apoplectic face becoming
more deeply purple, and his blear eyes leering angrily upon the calm
woman."I ain't a-goin' to stand this!I'm as sober
as any one here, an'--" William took the heavy man gently by the arm
and persuaded him to his feet.The other guests suppressed their
smiles and remained discreetly quiet."Have Henri take him to his club, William," said the Beaubien, rising.We will expect you Wednesday evening, and
we trust that we will not have to accept your excuses again."Gannette was led soddenly out.The Beaubien quietly resumed her seat.It was the second time the man had been dismissed from her table, and
the guests marveled that it did not mean the final loss of her favor.But she remained inscrutable; and the conversation quickly drifted
into new channels.A few moments later William returned and made a
quiet announcement:

"Mr.A huge presence emerged from the darkness into the light.The Beaubien
immediately rose and advanced to greet the newcomer.she
whispered, taking his hand.The man smiled down into her upturned, anxious face.His only reply
was a reassuring pressure of her hand.But she comprehended, and her
face brightened."Gentlemen," remarked Ames, taking the vacant chair, "the President's
message is out.I have been going over it with Hood--which accounts
for my tardiness," he added, nodding pleasantly to the Beaubien."Quoting from our chief executive's long list of innocent platitudes,
I may say that 'private monopoly is criminally unjust, wholly
indefensible, and not to be tolerated in a Republic founded upon the
premise of equal rights to all mankind.'"concurred Weston, holding up his glass and gazing
admiringly at the rich color of the wine."Quite my sentiments, too," murmured Fitch,
rolling his eyes upward and attempting with poor success to assume a
beatific expression."Furthermore," continued Ames, with mock gravity, "the interlocking of
corporation directorates must be prohibited by law; power must be
conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission to superintend the
financial management of railroads; holding-companies must cease to
exist; and corrective policies must be shaped, whereby so-called
'trusts' will be regulated and rendered innocuous."We are," said they all, in one voice."Carried," concluded Ames in a solemn tone.Then a burst of laughter
rose from the table; and even the inscrutable William smiled behind
his hand."But, seriously," said Weston, when the laughter had ceased, "I
believe we've got a President now who's going to do something, don't
you?""As long as the human mind
remains as it is there is nothing to fear, though Congress legislate
itself blue in the face.Reform is not to be made like a garment and
forced upon the people from the outside.Restrictive measures have not as yet, in all the history of
civilization, reformed a single criminal.""That we are puncture-proof," replied Ames with a light laugh."But what about your indictment in that cotton deal?Is Hood going to
find you law-proof there?""The case is settled," said Ames easily."I went into court this
morning and plead guilty to the indictment for conspiring to corner
the cotton market two years ago.I admitted that I violated the
Sherman law.The judge promptly fined me three thousand dollars, for
which I immediately wrote a check, leaving me still the winner by some
two million seven hundred thousand dollars on the deal, to say nothing
of compound interest on the three thousand for the past two years.You
see the beneficent effect of legislation, do you not?""By George, Ames, you certainly were stingy not to let us in on that!""Cotton belongs to me, gentlemen," replied Ames simply."Well," remarked Fitch, glancing about the table, "suppose we get down
to the business of the evening--if agreeable to our hostess," bowing
in the direction of the Beaubien."Has any one
anything new to offer?""There is a little
matter," he began, "that I have been revolving for some days.It occurred to
me some time ago that a franchise for a trolley line on that road
could be secured and ultimately sold for a round figure to the wealthy
residents whose estates lie along it, and who would give a million
dollars rather than have a line built there.After some preliminary
examination I got Hood to draft a bill providing for the building of
the road, and submitted it to Jacobson, Commissioner of Highways.He
reported that it would be the means of destroying the post road.I
convinced him, on the other hand, that it would be the means of lining
his purse with fifty thousand dollars.So he very naturally gave it
his endorsement.I then got in consultation with Senator Gossitch, and
had him arrange a meeting with the Governor, in Albany.I think," he
concluded, "that about five hundred thousand dollars will grease the
wheels all 'round.I've got the Governor on the hip in that Southern
Mexican deal, and he is at present eating out of my hand.I'll lay
this project on the table now, and you can take it up if you so
desire.""The scheme seems all right," commented Weston, after a short
meditation."Well, a net profit of half a million to split up among us would at
least provide for a yachting party next summer," remarked Ames
sententiously."And no work connected with it--in fact, the work has
been done.I shall want an additional five per cent for handling it."An animated discussion followed; and then Fitch offered a motion that
the group definitely take up the project.The Beaubien put the vote,
and it was carried without dissent."What about that potato scheme you were figuring on, Ames?"asked
Fitch at this juncture."I didn't get much encouragement from my
friends," he replied."I don't believe it," put in Weston emphatically."I have one million dollars that says it could," returned Ames calmly.Weston threw up his hands in token of surrender.he
exclaimed, scurrying for cover."Well," he said, "suppose we look into the scheme and
see if we don't want to handle it.It simply calls for a little
thought and work.He stopped and glanced at the Beaubien for approval.She nodded, and
he went on:

"I have lately been investigating the subject of various food supplies
other than wheat and corn as possible bases for speculation, and my
attention has been drawn strongly to a very humble one, potatoes."But Ames continued
unperturbed:

"I find that in some sections of the West potatoes are so plentiful at
times that they bring but twenty cents a bushel.My investigations
have covered a period of several months, and now I have in my
possession a large map of the United States with the potato sections,
prices, freight rates and all other necessary data indicated.My idea is to send agents into all these
sections next summer before the potatoes are turned up, and contract
for the entire crop at twenty-five cents a bushel.The agents will pay
the farmers cash, and agree to assume all expenses of digging,
packing, shipping, and so forth, allowing the farmer to take what he
needs for his own consumption.Needless to say, the potatoes will not
be removed from the fields, but will be allowed to rot in the ground.Those that do reach the market will sell for a dollar and a half in
New York and Chicago.""In other words," added Fitch, "you are simply figuring to corner the
market for the humble tuber, eh?""But--you say you have all the necessary data now?""All, even to the selection of a few of my agents.I can control
freight rates for what we may wish to ship.The rest of the crop will
be left to rot.And the
consumers will pay our price for what they must have.""And how much do you figure we shall
need to round the corner?""A million, cash in hand," replied Ames."Is this anything that the women can mix into?""You know they forced us to dump tons of our cold-storage stuff onto
the market two years ago.""That was when I controlled wheat," said Ames, "and was all tied up.It will be done so quietly
and thoroughly that it will all be over and the profits pocketed
before the women wake up to what we're doing.In this case there will
be nothing to store.And potatoes exposed in the field rot quickly,
you know."The rest of the group seemed to study the idea for some moments.Then
the practical Murdock inquired of Ames if he would agree to handle the
project, provided they took it up."Yes," assented Ames, "on a five per cent basis.And I am ready to put
agents in the field to-morrow.""Then, Madam Beaubien," said Fitch, "I move that we adopt the plan as
set forth by Mr.Ames, and commission him to handle it, calling upon
us equally for whatever funds he may need."A further brief discussion ensued; and then the resolution was
unanimously adopted."Say, Ames," queried Weston, with a glint of mischief in his eyes,
"will any of these potatoes be shipped over the C. and R.?"A laugh
went up around the table, in which Ames himself joined."Yes," he
said, "potatoes and cotton will both go over that road next summer,
and I shall fix the rebates."suggested Fitch, with a wink at
Murdock.Ames's mouth set grimly, and the smile left his face."Ketchim is
going to Sing Sing for that little deal," he returned in a low, cold
tone, so cold that even the Beaubien could not repress a little
shudder."I had him on Molino, but he trumped up a new company which
absorbed Molino and satisfied everybody, so I am blocked for the
present.But, mark me, I shall strip him of every dollar, and then put
him behind the bars before I've finished!"And no one sought to refute the man, for they knew he spoke truth.At midnight, while the cathedral chimes in the great hall clock were
sending their trembling message through the dark house, the Beaubien
rose, and the dinner was concluded.A few moments later the guests
were spinning in their cars to their various homes or clubs--all but
Ames.As he was preparing to leave, the Beaubien laid a hand on his
arm."Wait a moment, Wilton," she said."I have something important to
discuss with you."She led him into the morning room, where a fire was
blazing cheerily in the grate, and drew up a chair before it for him,
then nestled on the floor at his feet."I sent Gannette home this evening," she began, by way of introduction.I would drop him entirely, only you said--"

"We need him," interrupted Ames."I'll soil my hands by doing it; but it is for you.Now tell me," she
went on eagerly, "what about Colombia?Have you any further news from
Wenceslas?"The Church is
with the Government, and they will win--although your money may be
tied up for a few years.Still, you can't lose in the end."The woman sat for some moments gazing into the fire.Then:

"Lafelle was here again to-day.""Hold him, too," said Ames quickly."Looks as if I had made you a sort
of holding company, doesn't it?""But we
shall have good use for these fellows.""He gave me some very interesting news," she said; and then went on to
relate the conversation in detail.Ames laughed loudly as he
listened."And now, Wilton," said the Beaubien, a determined look
coming into her face, "you have always said that you never forgave me
for making you let Jim Crowles off, when you had him by the throat.Well, I'm going to give you a chance to get more than even.Jim's fat
widow is after your wife's scalp.I intend that she shall lose her own
in the chase.I've got my plans all laid, and I want your wife to meet
the lovely Mrs.Hawley-Crowles at the Fitch's next Thursday afternoon.It will be just a formal call--mutual introductions--and, later, an
invitation from Mrs.Meantime, I want you
to get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles involved in a financial way, and shear her
of every penny!"My dear," said he, taking her hand, "you are charming this
evening.she deprecated, although the smile she gave him
attested her pleasure in the compliment."Well," she continued
briskly, "if I'm so beautiful, you can't help loving me; and if you
love me, you will do what I ask."Really,
I've long since forgotten him.Do you realize that that was more than
ten years ago?""Please don't mention years, dear," she murmured, shuddering a little."Tell me, what can we do to teach this fat hussy a lesson?""Well," he suggested, laughing, "we might get Ketchim after her, to
sell her a wad of his worthless stocks; then when he goes down, as he
is going one of these days, we will hope that it will leave her on the
rocks of financial ruin, eh?""Why, among other innocent novelties, a scheme bearing the sonorous
title of Simiti Development Company, I am told by my brokers."Why--I've heard Carmen mention that name.I wonder--"

"Well, and who is Carmen?""My little friend--the one and only honest person I've ever dealt
with, excepting, of course, present company."And now where does this Carmen enter the
game?""Why, she's--surely you know about her!""Well, she is a little Colombian--"

"Colombian!"Came up with the engineers who
went down there for Ketchim to examine the Molino properties.She
lived all her life in a town called Simiti until she came up here."Ames leaned over and looked steadily into the fire."Never heard of
the place," he murmured dreamily."Well," said the Beaubien eagerly, "she's a--a wonderful child!I'm
different when I'm with her."He roused from his meditations and smiled down at the woman."Then I'd
advise you not to be with her much, for I prefer you as you are."Then the woman looked up at her
companion.The man started; then drew himself up and gave a little nervous laugh."Of you," he replied evasively, "always."She reached up and slapped his cheek tenderly."You were dreaming of
your awful business deals," she said."What have you in hand
now?--besides the revolution in Colombia, your mines, your mills, your
banks, your railroads and trolley lines, your wheat and potato
corners, your land concessions and cattle schemes, and--well, that's a
start, at least," she finished, pausing for breath.I'm buying every bale I can find, in Europe, Asia, and
the States.""But, Will, you've been caught in cotton before, you know.And I don't
believe you can get away with it again.Unless--"

"That's it--unless," he interrupted."And that's just the part I have
taken care of.The cotton schedule will go
through as I have it outlined.They
don't dare refuse to pass the measure.In a few
months the tariff on cotton products will be up.The new tariff-wall
sends the price of raw stuff soaring.I
was beaten on the last deal simply because of faulty weather
prognostications.I'll let you in, if you wish.But these other fellows have got
to stay out.""I haven't a penny to invest, Will," she replied mournfully."You got
me so terribly involved in this Colombian revolution.""Oh, well," he returned easily, "I'll lend you what you need, any
amount.And you can give me your advice and suggestions from time to
time.As for your Colombian investments, haven't I guaranteed them,
practically?""Not in writing," she said, looking up at him with a twinkle in her
eyes."No, certainly not," she returned, giving him a glance of admiration.Hawley-Crowles is going to be received into your
wife's set, and you are going to give her a good financial whipping?"Hawley-Crowles
shall go to the poor-house, if you say the word.But now, my dear,
have William order my car.Hawley-Crowles at Fitch's?"Yes, dear," murmured the Beaubien, reaching up and kissing him; "next
Thursday at three.Call me on the 'phone to-morrow."CHAPTER 12


The Ames building, a block from the Stock Exchange, was originally
only five stories in height.But as the Ames interests grew, floor
after floor was added, until, on the day that Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
pointed it out to Carmen from the window of her limousine, it had
reached, tower and all, a height of twenty-five stories, and was
increasing at an average rate of two additional a year.It was not its
size that aroused interest, overtopped as it was by many others, but
its uniqueness; for, though a hive of humming industry, it did not
house a single business that was not either owned outright or
controlled by J. Wilton Ames, from the lowly cigar stands in the
marble corridors to the great banking house of Ames and Company on the
second floor.The haberdashers, the shoe-shining booths, the soda
fountains, and the great commercial enterprises that dwelt about them,
each and all acknowledged fealty and paid homage to the man who
brooded over them in his magnificent offices on the twenty-fifth floor
in the tower above.It was not by any consensus of opinion among the financiers of New
York that Ames had assumed leadership, but by sheer force of what
was doubtless the most dominant character developed in recent
years by those peculiar forces which have produced the American
multimillionaire."And," he once added, when, despite his anger, he could
not but admire Ames's tactical blocking of his piratical move, which
the former's keen foresight had perceived threatened danger at
Washington, "it is not by any tacit agreement that we accept him,
but because he knows ten tricks to our one, that's all."To look at the man, now in his forty-fifth year, meant, generally, an
expression of admiration for his unusual physique, and a wholly
erroneous appraisal of his character.His build was that of a
gladiator.He stood six-feet-four in height, with Herculean shoulders
and arms, and a pair of legs that suggested nothing so much as the
great pillars which supported the facade of the Ames building.Those
arms and legs, and those great back-muscles, had sent his college
shell to victory every year that he had sat in the boat.They had won
every game on the gridiron in which he had participated as the
greatest "center" the college ever developed.For baseball he was a
bit too massive, much to his own disappointment, but the honors he
failed to secure there he won in the field events, and in the
surreptitiously staged boxing and wrestling bouts when, hidden away in
the cellar of some secret society hall, he would crush his opponents
with an ease and a peculiar glint of satisfaction in his gray eyes
that was grimly prophetic of days to come.His mental attitude toward
contests for superiority of whatever nature did not differ essentially
from that of the Roman gladiators: he entered them to win.If he fell,
well and good; he expected "thumbs down."If he won, his opponent need
look for no exhibition of generosity on his part.When his man lay
prone before him, he stooped and cut his throat.And he would have
loathed the one who forbore to do likewise with himself.In scholarship he might have won a place, had not the physical side of
his nature been so predominant, and his remarkable muscular strength
so great a prize to the various athletic coaches and directors.Ames
was first an animal; there was no stimulus as yet sufficiently strong
to arouse his latent spirituality.And yet his intellect was keen; and
to those studies to which he was by nature or inheritance especially
attracted, economics, banking, and all branches of finance, he brought
a power of concentration that was as stupendous as his physical
strength.His mental make-up was peculiar, in that it was the epitome
of energy--manifested at first only in brute force--and in that it was
wholly deficient in the sense of fear.Because of this his daring was
phenomenal.Immediately upon leaving college Ames became associated with his
father in the already great banking house of Ames and Company.But the
animality of his nature soon found the confinement irksome; his
father's greater conservatism hampered his now rapidly expanding
spirit of commercialism; and after a few years in the banking house he
withdrew and set up for himself.The father, while lacking the boy's
fearlessness, had long since recognized dominant qualities in him
which he himself did not possess, and he therefore confidently
acquiesced in his son's desire, and, in addition, gave him _carte
blanche_ in the matter of funds for his speculative enterprises.Four years later J. Wilton Ames, rich in his own name, already
becoming recognized as a power in the world of finance, with
diversified enterprises which reached into almost every country of the
globe, hastened home from a foreign land in response to a message
announcing the sudden death of his father.The devolving of his
parent's vast fortune upon himself--he was the sole heir--then
necessitated his permanent location in New York.And so, reluctantly
giving up his travels, he gathered his agents and lieutenants about
him, concentrating his interests as much as possible in the Ames
building, and settled down to the enjoyment of expanding his huge
fortune.A few months later he married, and the union amalgamated the
proud old Essex stock of Ames, whose forbears fought under the
Conqueror and were written in the Doomsday Book, to the wealthy and
aristocratic Van Heyse branch of old Amsterdam.To this union were
born a son and a daughter, twins.The interval between his graduation from college and the death of his
father was all but unknown to the cronies of his subsequent years in
New York.Though he had spent much of it in the metropolis, he had
been self-centered and absorbed, even lonely, while laying his plans
and developing the schemes which resulted in financial preeminence.With unlimited money at his disposal, he was unhampered in the choice
of his business clientele, and he formed it from every quarter of the
globe.Much of his time had been spent abroad, and he had become as
well known on the Paris bourse and the exchanges of Europe as in his
native land.Confident and successful from the outset; without any
trace of pride or touch of hauteur in his nature; as wholly lacking in
ethical development and in generosity as he was in fear; gradually
becoming more sociable and companionable, although still reticent of
certain periods of his past; his cunning and brutality increasing with
years; and his business sagacity and keen strategy becoming the talk
of the Street; with no need to raise his eyes beyond the low plane of
his material endeavors; he pursued his business partly for the
pleasure the game afforded him, partly for the power which his
accumulations bestowed upon him, and mostly because it served as an
adequate outlet for his tremendous, almost superhuman, driving energy.If he betrayed and debauched ideals, it was because he was utterly
incapable of rising to them, nor felt the stimulus to make the
attempt.If he achieved no noble purpose, it was because when he
glanced at the mass of humanity about him he looked through the lenses
of self.His glance fell always first upon J. Wilton Ames--and he
never looked beyond.The world had been created for him; the cosmos
but expressed his Ego.On the morning after his conversation with the Beaubien regarding the
social aspirations of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the financier sat at his
rich mahogany desk on the top floor of the Ames building in earnest
discussion with his lawyer, Alonzo Hood.The top floor of the tower
was divided into eight rooms.Two of these constituted Ames's inner
_sanctum_; one was Hood's private office; and the rest were devoted
to clerks and stenographers.A telegrapher occupied an alcove
adjoining Hood's room, and handled confidential messages over
private wires to the principal cities in the country.A private
telephone connected Ames's desk with the Beaubien mansion.Private
lines ran to the Stock Exchange and to various other points
throughout the city.The telegraph and telephone companies gave his
messages preference over all others.At a word he would be placed in
almost instant communication with New Orleans, San Francisco, London,
Berlin, or Cairo.Private lines and speaking tubes ran to every room
or floor of the building where a company, firm, or individual was
doing business.At the office of the Telegraph Service up-town he
maintained messengers who carried none but his own despatches.In
the railroad yards his private car stood always in readiness; and in
the harbor his yacht was kept constantly under steam.A motor car
stood ever in waiting in the street below, close to the shaft of a
private automatic elevator, which ran through the building for his
use alone.This elevator also penetrated the restaurant in the
basement of the building, where a private room and a special waiter
were always at the man's disposal.A private room and special
attendant were maintained in the Turkish baths adjoining, and he
had his own personal suite and valet at his favorite club up-town.This morning he was at his desk, as usual, at eight o'clock.Before
him lay the various daily reports from his mines, his mills, his
railroads, and his bank.These disposed of, there followed a quick
survey of the day's appointments, arranged for him by his chief
secretary.As the latter entered, Ames was
absorbed in the legend of the stock ticker."C. and R. closed yesterday at twenty-six," he commented.Then,
swinging back in his chair, "What's Stolz doing?""For one thing, he has made Miss Fagin his private stenographer,"
replied Hood."Now we will begin to get real information," he
remarked."Tell Miss Fagin you will give her fifty dollars a week from
now on; but she is to deliver to you a carbon copy of every letter she
writes for Stolz.And I want those copies on my desk every morning
when I come down.Hood," he continued, abruptly turning the
conversation, "what have you dug up about Ketchim's new company?""Very little, sir," replied Hood with a trace of embarrassment."His
lawyer is a fledgeling named Cass, young, but wise enough not to talk.I called on him yesterday afternoon to have a little chat about the
old Molino company, representing that I was speaking for certain
stockholders.But he told me to bring the stockholders in and he would
talk with them personally."Ames laughed, while the lawyer grinned sheepishly."Is that the sort
of service you are rendering for a hundred-thousand-dollar salary?""Hood, I'm ashamed of you!""I can't blame you; I am ashamed of myself," replied the lawyer."Well," continued Ames good-naturedly, "leave Ketchim to me.I've got
three men now buying small amounts of stock in his various companies.I'll call for receiverships pretty soon, and we will see this time
that he doesn't refund the money.Now about other matters: the Albany
post trolley deal is to go through.Work up
the details and let me have them at once.Have you got the senate bill
drawn for Gossitch?"As it stands now, the repealing
section gives any city the right to grant saloon licenses of
indefinite length, instead of for one year."We want the bill so drawn that it will become
practically impossible to revoke a license.""As it now reads," said Hood, "it makes a saloon license assignable.That creates a property right that can hardly be revoked.""As I figure, it will create a value of some
twenty millions for those who own saloons in New York.And if the United States ever reaches the point
where it will have to buy the saloons in order to wipe them out, it
will face a very handsome little expenditure."Ames, a very large part of the stock of American brewing
companies is owned in Europe.How are you--"

"Nominally, it is.But for two years, and more, I have been quietly
gathering in brewing stock from abroad, and to-day I have some ten
millions in my own control, from actual purchases, options, and so
forth.I'm going to organize a holding company, when the time arrives,
and I figure that within the next year or so we will practically
control the production of beer and spirituous liquors in the United
States and Europe.The formation of that company will be a task worthy
of your genius, Hood.""It will be a pleasure to undertake it," replied Hood with animation.Ames, I got in touch with Senator Mall last evening
at the club, and he assures me that the senate committee have so
changed the phraseology of the tariff bill on cotton products that the
clause you wish retained will be continued with its meaning unaltered.In fact, the discrimination which the hosiery interests desire will be
fully observed.Your suggestion as to an ad valorem duty of fifty per
cent on hose valued at less than sixty-five cents a dozen pairs is
exceptionally clever, in view of the fact that there are none of less
than that value.""Triumphant Republicanism," he commented."And
right in the face of the President's message.Wire Mall that I will be
in Washington Thursday evening to advise with him further about it.Hood, we've got a fight on in regard to
the President's idea of granting permission in private suits to use
judgments and facts brought out and entered in government suits
against combinations.And the
regulation of security issues of railroads--preposterous!If Mall and Gossitch and Wells don't oppose
that in the Senate, I'll see that they are up before the lunacy
commission--and I have some influence with that body!""There is nothing to fear, I think," replied Hood reassuringly."An
important piece of business legislation like that will hardly go
through this session.And then we will have time to prepare to
frustrate it.The suggestion to place the New York Stock Exchange
under government supervision is a much more serious matter, I think.""See here, Hood," said Ames, leaning forward and laying a hand upon
that gentleman's knee, "when that happens, we'll have either a
Socialist president or a Catholic in the White House, with Rome
twitching the string.Then I shall move to my Venezuelan estates, take
the vow of poverty, and turn monk.""Which reminds me again that by your continued relations with Rome you
are doing much to promote just that state of affairs," returned the
lawyer sententiously."But I find the Catholic Church
convenient--indeed, necessary--for the promotion of certain plans.But I shall
abruptly sever my relations with that institution some day--when I am
through with it.At present I am milking the Church to the extent of a
brimming pail every year; and as long as the udder is full and
accessible I shall continue to tap it.I tapped the Presbyterian
Church, through Borwell, last year, if you remember."Willett, chief secretary to Ames, entered at that moment with the
morning mail, opened and sorted, and replies written to letters of
such nature as he could attend to without suggestions from his chief."By the way," remarked Hood when he saw the letters, "I had word from
Collins this morning that he had secured a signed statement from that
fellow Marcus, who was crushed in the Avon mills yesterday.Marcus
accepted the medical services of our physicians, and died in our
hospital.Just before he went off, his wife accepted a settlement of
one hundred dollars.Looked big to her, I guess, and was a bird in the
hand."That reminds me," said Ames, looking up from his mail; "we are going
to close the mills earlier this year on account of the cotton
shortage.""Four thousand hands idle for three months, I suppose.we just escaped disaster last year, you remember.""It will be more than three months this time," commented Ames with a
knowing look.Then--"Hood, I verily believe you are a coward."Ames," replied the latter slowly, "I certainly would
hesitate to do some of the things you do.Yet you seem to get away
with them.""Perk up, Hood," laughed Ames."I've got real work for you as soon as
I get control of C. and R. I'm going to put you in as president, at a
salary of one hundred thousand per annum.Then you are going to buy
the road for me for about two million dollars, and I'll reorganize and
sell to the stockholders for five millions, still retaining control.The road is only a scrap heap, but its control is the first step
toward the amalgamation of the trolley interests of New England.Laws
are going to be violated, Hood, both in actual letter and in spirit.It's up to you to get around the
Interstate Commerce Commission in any way you can, and buttress this
little monopoly against competition and reform-infected legislatures."We'll send Crabbe to the Senate," Ames coolly replied."You seem to forget that senators are now elected by the people, Mr.The people are New York City, Buffalo, and
Albany.And Tammany at present is in my pocket.Buffalo and Albany can be swept by the Catholic vote.And I have that
in the upper right hand drawer of my private file.The 'people' will
therefore elect to the Senate the man I choose.In fact, I prefer
direct election of senators over the former method, for the people are
greater fools _en masse_ than any State Legislature that ever
assembled."He took up another letter from the pile on his desk and glanced
through it."Protests against the way
you nullified the Glaze-Bassett red-light injunction bill.I really didn't think it was in you."said Hood, puffing a little with
pride.But for that, the passage of the bill would have wiped out the
whole red-light district, and quartered the rents I now get from my
shacks down there.Now next year we will be better prepared to fight
the bill.The press will be with us then--a little cheaper and a
trifle more degraded than it is to-day."Ames read it and handed
it to his lawyer."The _Proteus_ has reached the African Gold Coast at
last," he said.Then he threw back his head and laughed heartily."Do
you know, Hood, the _Proteus_ carried two missionaries, sent to the
frizzle-topped Zulus by Borwell and his outfit.Deutsch and Company
cable that they have arrived.""But," said Hood in some perplexity, "the cargo of the _Proteus_ was
rum!""Just so," roared Ames; "that's where the joke comes in.I make it a
point that every ship of mine that carries a missionary to a foreign
field shall also carry a cargo of rum.The combination is one that the
Zulu finds simply irresistible!""So," commented Hood, "the Church goes down to Egypt for help!""I carry the missionaries free on my rum
boats.Great saving to the Board of Foreign Missions, you know."Hood looked at the man before him in undisguised admiration of his
cunning."And did you likewise send missionaries to China with your
opium cargoes?""I once sent Borwell himself to Hongkong on a boat
loaded to the rails with opium.We had insisted on his taking a needed
vacation, and so packed him off to Europe.In Bombay I cabled him to
take the _Crotus_ to Hongkong, transportation free.That was my last
consignment of opium to China, for restrictions had already fallen
upon our very Christian England, and the opium traffic was killed.I
had plans laid to corner the entire opium business in India, and I'd
have cleaned up a hundred million out of it, but for the pressure of
public sentiment.However, we're going to educate John Chinaman to
substitute whiskey for opium.But now," glancing at the great electric
wall clock, "I've wasted enough time with you.By the way, do you know
why this Government withheld recognition of the Chinese Republic?""No," replied Hood, standing in anticipation."Thirty thousand chests of opium," returned Ames laconically."Ames and Company had advanced to the English banks of Shanghai and
Hongkong half this amount, loaned on the opium.That necessitated a
few plain words from me to the President, and a quick trip from
Washington to London afterwards to interview his most Christian
British Majesty.A very pleasant and profitable trip, Hood, very!Hood threw his chief another look of intense admiration, and left the
room."Get Lafelle here some time to-day when I have a vacant hour,"
commanded Ames."Cable to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, of Cartagena, and
ask him if an American mining company is registered there under the
name of Simiti Development Company, and what properties they have and
where located.Tell him to cable reply, and follow with detailed
letter."He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes."The Congregation of
the Sacred Index has laid the ban on--what's the name of the book?"He
drew out a card-index drawer and selected a card, which he tossed to
the secretary.He seemed to
muse a while, then went on slowly."Carlos Madero, of Mexico, is in
New York.Learn where he is staying, and arrange an interview for me.Wire Senator Wells, Washington, that the bill for a Children's Bureau
must not be taken from the table.Wire the Sequana Coal
Company that I want their report to-morrow, without fail.Wire
Collins, at Avon, to tell the Spinners' Union I have nothing to
discuss with them.As Hood was chief of the Ames legal department, and Willett the chief
of his army of secretaries, so Hodson was the captain of his force of
brokers, a keen, sagacious trader, whose knowledge of the market and
whose ability in the matter of stock trading was almost uncanny."What's your selection for to-day, Hodson?"asked Ames, as the man
entered.Hodson laid on his desk three lists of suggested deals on the
exchanges of New York, London, and Paris.Ames glanced over them
hurriedly, drawing his pencil through certain that did not meet his
approval, and substituting others in which for particular reasons he
wished to trade that morning."What's your reason for thinking I ought
to buy Public Utilities?""They have the letting of the Hudson river tunnel contract," replied
Hodson.Ames studied the broker's face a moment.Then his own brightened, as
he began to divine the man's reason.he ejaculated, "you
think there's quicksand along the proposed route?""I know it," said Hodson calmly."Pick up ten thousand shares, if you can get them," returned Ames
quickly.Then--"I'm going to attend a meeting of the Council of
American Grain Exchanges at two to-day.I want you to be just outside
the door."Ames concluded, "I guess that's all.I'm at the bank at ten; at the Board of Trade at ten-thirty; Stock
Exchange at eleven; and lunch at Rector's at twelve sharp, returning
here immediately afterward."Hodson again bowed, and left the office to undertake his various
commissions.For the next half hour Ames pored over the morning's quota of letters
and messages, making frequent notes, and often turning to the
telephone at his hand.Then he summoned a stenographer and rapidly
dictated a number of replies."In my next vacant hour, following the one devoted to Lafelle, I want
to see Reverend Darius Borwell," he directed."Also," he continued,
"wire Strunz that I want a meeting of the Brewers' Union called at the
earliest possible date.By the way, ask Lafelle if he can spend the
night with me on board the _Cossack_, and if so, notify Captain
McCall.Here is a bundle of
requests for charity, for contributions to hospitals, orphan asylums,
and various homes.'Phone to the
City Assessor to come over whenever you can arrange an hour and go
over my schedule with me.By the way, tell Hood to take steps at once
to foreclose on the Bradley estate.Did you find out where Ketchim
does his banking?""Yes, sir," replied the secretary, "the Commercial State.""Very well, get the president, Mr.A few moments later Ames had purchased from the Commercial State bank
its note against the Ketchim Realty Company for ten thousand dollars."I thought Ketchim would be borrowing again," he chuckled, when he had
completed the transaction."His brains are composed of a disastrous
mixture of hypocrisy and greed.I've thrown another hook into him
now."At nine forty-five Ames left his private office and descended in his
elevator to the banking house on the second floor.He entered the
directors' room with a determined carriage, nodding pleasantly to his
associates.Taking his seat as chairman, he promptly called the
meeting to order.Some preliminary business occupied the first few minutes, and then
Ames announced:

"Gentlemen, when the State of New York offered the public sixty
millions of four per cent bonds last week, and I advised you to take
them at a premium of six per cent, you objected.I overruled you, and
the bank bought the bonds.Within forty-eight hours they were resold
at a premium of seven per cent, and the bank cleared six hundred
thousand.Now let me suggest that the
psychology of this transaction is worth your study.A commodity is a
drug on the market at one dollar, until somebody is willing to pay a
dollar and a half for it.Then a lot of people will want it, until
somebody else offers a bid of two.Then the price will soar, and the
number of those who covet the article and scramble for it will
increase proportionably.A murmur of admiration rose from the directors."I think," said one,
"that we had better send Mr.Ames to Washington to confer with the
President in regard to the proposed currency legislation.""That is already arranged," put in Ames."I meet the President next
Thursday for a conference on this matter.""Why, in that case," returned Ames with a knowing smile, "I think we
had better give him a little lesson to take out of office with
him--one that will ruin his second-term hopes--and then close our
bank."From the bank, the Board of Trade, the Stock Exchange, and his
luncheon with Senator Gossitch, Ames returned to his office for the
private interviews which his chief secretary had arranged.Then
followed further consultations with Hood over the daily, weekly, and
monthly reports which Ames required from all the various commercial,
financial, and mining enterprises in which he was interested; further
discussions of plans and schemes; further receipt and transmission of
cable, telegraphic, and telephone messages; and meetings with his
heads of departments, his captains, lieutenants, and minor officers,
to listen to their reports and suggestions, and to deliver his quick,
decisive commands, admonitions, and advice.From eight in the morning
until, as was his wont, Ames closed his desk and entered his private
elevator at five-thirty in the evening, his office flashed with the
superenergy of the man, with his intense activity, his decisive words,
and his stupendous endeavors, materialistic, absorptive, ruthless
endeavors.If one should ask what his day really amounted to, we can
but point to these incessant endeavors and their results in augmenting
his already vast material interests and his colossal fortune, a
fortune which Hood believed ran well over a hundred millions, and
which Ames himself knew multiplied that figure by five or ten.And the
fortune was increasing at a frightful pace, for he gave nothing, but
continually drew to himself, always and ever drawing, accumulating,
amassing, and absorbing, and for himself alone.Snapping his desk shut, he held a brief conversation over the wire
with the Beaubien, then descended to his waiting car and was driven
hastily to his yacht, the _Cossack_, where Monsignor Lafelle awaited
as his guest.It was one of the few pleasures which Ames allowed
himself during the warm months, to drop his multifarious interests and
spend the night aboard the _Cossack_, generally alone, rocking gently
on the restless billows, so typical of his own heaving spirit, as the
beautiful craft steamed noiselessly to and fro along the coast, well
beyond the roar of the huge _arena_ where human beings, formed of
dust, yet fatuously believing themselves made in the image of infinite
Spirit, strive and sweat, curse and slay, in the struggle to prove
their doubtful right to live.CHAPTER 13


The _Cossack_, with its great turbines purring like a sleeping kitten,
and its twin screws turning lazily, almost imperceptibly in the dark
waters, moved through the frosty night like a cloud brooding over the
deep.Yet it was a cloud of tremendous potentiality, enwrapping a
spirit of energy incarnate.From far aloft its burning eye pierced a
channel of light through the murky darkness ahead.In its wake it drew
a swell of sparkling phosphorescence, which it carelessly tossed off
on either side as a Calif might throw handfuls of glittering coins to
his fawning beggars.From somewhere in the structure above, the
crackling, hissing wireless mechanism was thrusting its invisible
hands out into the night and catching the fleeting messages that were
borne on the intangible pulsations of the mysterious ether.From time
to time these messages were given form and body, and despatched to the
luxurious suite below, where, in the dazzling sheen of silver and cut
glass, spread out over richest napery, and glowing beneath a torrent
of white light, sat the gigantic being whose will directed the
movements of this floating palace."You see, Lafelle, I look upon religion with the eye of the
cold-blooded business man, without the slightest trace of sentimentalism.From the business standpoint, the Protestant Church is a dead failure.It doesn't get results that are in any way commensurate with its
investment.But your Church is a success--from the point of dollars and
cents.In fact, in the matter of forming and maintaining a monopoly, I
take off my hat to the Vatican.Every day I learn something of value by studying your methods of
operating upon the public.And so you see why I take such pleasure in
talking with really astute churchmen like yourself."Monsignor Lafelle studied the man without replying, uncertain just
what interpretation to put upon the remark.The Japanese servant was
clearing away the remnants of the meal, having first lighted the
cigars of the master and guest."Now," continued Ames, leaning back in his luxurious chair and musing
over his cigar, "the purgatory idea is one of the cleverest schemes
ever foisted upon the unthinking masses, and it has proved a veritable
Klondike.if I could think up and put over a thing like that I'd
consider myself really possessed of brains."Ames," he replied adroitly, "you
do not know your Bible."I don't suppose I ever in my life read a whole
chapter in the book.I can't swallow such stuff, Lafelle--utterly
unreasonable, wholly inconsistent with facts and natural laws, as we
know and are able to observe them.Even as a child I never had any
use for fairy-tales, or wonder-stories.I always wanted facts,
tangible, concrete, irrefutable facts, not hypotheses.The Protestant
churches hand out a mess of incoherent guesswork, based on as many
interpretations of the Bible as there are human minds sufficiently
interested to interpret it, and then wax hot and angry when
hard-headed business men like myself refuse to subscribe to it.If they had anything tangible to
offer, it would be different.But I go to church for the looks of
the thing, and for business reasons; and then stick pins into myself
to keep awake while I listen to pedagogical Borwell tell what he
doesn't know about God and man.Then at the close of the service I
drop a five-dollar bill into the plate for the entertainment, and
go away with the feeling that I didn't get my money's worth.From a
business point of view, a Protestant church service is worth about
twenty-five cents for the music, and five cents for the privilege of
sleeping on a soft cushion.So you see I lose four dollars and
seventy cents every time I attend.You Catholic fellows, with your
ceremonial and legerdemain, give a much better entertainment.Besides, I like to hear your priests soak it to their cowering
flocks.""I shall have to class you with the incorrigibles," he
said with a rueful air."I am sorry you take such a harsh attitude
toward us.We are really more spiritual--"

Ames interrupted with a roar of laughter."Why, Lafelle, you old fraud, I look upon your
Church as a huge business institution, a gigantic trust, as mercenary
and merciless as Steel, Oil, or Tobacco!Why, you and I are in the
same business, that of making money!And I'd like to borrow some of
your methods.Only, you've got it over me, for you
hurl the weight of centuries of authority upon the poor, trembling
public; and I have to beat them down with clubs of my own making.Moreover, the law protects you in all your pious methods; while I have
to hire expensive legal talent to get around it.""You seem to be fairly successful, even at that," retorted Lafelle.Then, too politic to draw his host into an acrimonious argument that
might end in straining their now cordial and mutually helpful
friendship, he observed, looking at his cigar: "May I ask what you pay
for these?--for only an inexhaustible bank reserve can warrant their
like."He had struck the right chord, and Ames softened at once."These," he
said, tenderly regarding the thick, black weed in his fingers, "are
grown exclusively for me on my own plantation in Colombia.They cost
me about one dollar and sixty-eight cents each, laid down at my door
in New York.I searched the world over before I found the only spot
where such tobacco could be grown."continued Lafelle, lifting his glass of sparkling
champagne."On a little hillside, scarcely an acre in extent, in Granada, Spain,"
replied Ames."I have my own wine press and bottling plant there."Lafelle could not conceal his admiration for this man of luxury."And
does your exclusiveness extend also to your tea and coffee?""I grow tea for my table in both China and
Ceylon.And I have exclusive coffee plantations in Java and Brazil.But I'm now negotiating for one in Colombia, for I think that, without
doubt, the finest coffee in the world is grown there, although it
never gets beyond the coast line.""_Fortuna non deo_," murmured the churchman; "you man of chance and
destiny!""My friend," said he, "I have always insisted
that I possessed but a modicum of brains; but I am a gambler.With ordinary judgment and horse-sense, I take risks that
no so-called sane man would consider.The curse of the world is
fear--the chief instrument that you employ to hold the masses to your
churchly system.I know that as long as a
business opponent has fear to contend with, I am his master.Fear is
at the root of every ailment of mind, body, or environment.I repeat,
I know not the meaning of the word.Hence my position in the business
world.Hence, also, my freedom from the limitations of superstition,
religious or otherwise."Yes," replied Lafelle, drawing a long sigh, "in a sense I do.But you
greatly err, my friend, in deprecating your own powerful intellect.I
know of no brain but yours that could have put South Ohio Oil from one
hundred and fifty dollars up to over two thousand a share.I had a few
shares of that stock myself."Sorry I didn't know about it," he said.I didn't own a dollar's worth of South Ohio.Oh,
yes," he added, as he saw Lafelle's eyes widening in surprise, "I
pushed the market up until a certain lady, whom you and I both know,
thought it unwise to go further, and then I sprung the sudden
discovery of Colombian oil fields on them; and the market crashed
like a burst balloon.The lady cleared some two millions on the rig.No, I didn't have a drop of Colombian oil to grease the chute.It was
American nerve, that's all.""If you had lived in the Middle Ages you'd
have been burnt for possessing a devil!""On the contrary," quickly amended Ames, his eyes twinkling, "I'd have
been made a Cardinal."Both men laughed over the retort; and then Ames summoned the valet to
set in motion the great electrical pipe-organ, and to bring the
whiskey and soda.For the next hour the two men gave themselves up to the supreme luxury
of their magnificent environment, the stimulation of their beverage
and cigars, and the soothing effect of the soft music, combined with
the gentle movement of the boat.Then Ames took his guest into the
smoking room proper, and drew up chairs before a small table, on which
were various papers and writing materials."Now," he began, "referring to your telephone message of this morning,
what is it that you want me to do for you?Is it the old question of
establishing a nunciature at Washington?"Lafelle had been impatiently awaiting this moment.He therefore
plunged eagerly into his subject.Ames," said he, "I know you to
have great influence at the Capital.In the interests of humanity, I
ask you to use that influence to prevent the passage of the
immigration bill which provides for a literacy test."There was no need of this request; for, in the
interests, not of humanity, but of his own steamship companies, he
intended that there should be no restriction imposed upon immigration.But the Church was again playing into his hands, coming to him for
favors.And the Church always paid heavily for his support.he exclaimed with an assumption of interest, "so you ask me to
impugn my own patriotism!""I don't quite understand," he said."Why," Ames explained, "how long do you figure it will take, with
unrestricted immigration, for the Catholics to so outnumber the
Protestants in the United States as to establish their religion by law
and force it into the schools?""But your Constitution provides toleration for all
religions!""And the Constitution is quite flexible, and wholly subject to
amendment, is it not?"Lafelle flared out in unrestrained anger."What a bugaboo you
Protestants make of Roman Catholicism!"Why,
one would think that we Catholics were all anarchists!Are we such a
menace, such a curse to your Republican institutions?Do you ever stop
to realize what the Church has done for civilization, and for your
own country?And where, think you, would art and learning be now but
for her?Have you any adequate idea what the Church is doing
to-day for the poor, for the oppressed?You Protestants,
a thousand times more intolerant than we, treat us as if we were
Hindoo pariahs!This whole country is suffering from the delirium of
Roman Catholic-phobia!"There, my friend, calm yourself," soothed Ames, laying a hand on the
irate churchman's arm."And please do not class me with the
Protestants, for I am not one of them.You Catholic fellows have made
admirable gains in the past few years, and your steady encroachments
have netted you about ninety per cent of all the political offices in
and about Washington, so you have no complaint, even if the Church
isn't in politics.Meantime, his brain was working
rapidly."By the way, Lafelle," he said, abruptly resuming the
conversation, "you know all about church laws and customs, running way
back to mediaeval times.Can't you dig up some old provision whereby I
can block a fellow who claims to own a gold mine down in Colombia?If
you can, I'll see that the President vetoes every obnoxious
immigration bill that's introduced this term."Lafelle roused from his sulk and gulped down his wrath.Ames went on
to express his desire for vengeance upon one obscure Philip O. Ketchim,
broker, promoter, church elder, and Sunday school superintendent.Then at length Ames rose and rang for his valet."My God, Lafelle, the
idea's a corker!""From a book entitled 'Confessions of a Roman
Catholic Priest,' written anonymously, but, they say, by a young
attache of the Vatican who was insane at the time.However, he was apparently well informed on matters Colombian.""The law of _'en manos muertas'_," replied Lafelle."Well," exclaimed Ames, "again I take off my hat to your churchly
system!And now," he continued eagerly, "cable the Pope at once.I'll
have the operator send your code ashore by wireless, and the message
will go to Rome to-night.Tell the old man you've got influence at
work in Washington that is--well, more than strong, and that the
prospects for defeating the immigration bill are excellent."Lafelle arose and stood for a moment looking about the room."Before I
retire, my friend," he said, "I would like to express again the
admiration which the tasteful luxury of this smoking room has aroused
in me, and to ask, if I may, whether those stained-glass windows up
there are merely fanciful portraits?"Ames quickly glanced up at the faces of the beautiful women portrayed
in the rectangular glass windows which lined the room just below the
ceiling.They were exquisitely painted, in vivid colors, and so set as
to be illuminated during the day by sunlight, and at night by strong
electric lamps behind them."Because," returned Lafelle, "if I mistake not, I have seen a portrait
similar to that one," pointing up at one of the windows, where a sad,
wistful face of rare loveliness looked down upon them.In his complete absorption he had not noticed the
effect of his query upon Ames."I do not know," he replied slowly."London--Paris--Berlin--no, not there.And yet, it was in Europe, I am
sure."In the--Royal Gallery--at Madrid!""Yes," continued Lafelle confidently, still studying the portrait, "I
am certain of it.But," turning abruptly upon Ames, "you may have
known the original?""I assure you I never had that
pleasure," he said lightly."These art windows were set in by the
designer of the yacht.Adds much to the
general effect, don't you think?By the way, if a portrait similar to
that one hangs in the Royal Gallery at Madrid, you might try to learn
the identity of the original for me.It's quite interesting to feel
that one may have the picture of some bewitching member of royalty
hanging in his own apartments.By all means try to learn who the lady
is--unless you know."He stopped and searched the churchman's face.But--that picture
has haunted me from the day I first saw it in the Royal Gallery."Crafts, of 'Storrs and Crafts,'" replied Ames.Lafelle moved thoughtfully toward the door.The valet appeared at that
moment."Show Monsignor to his stateroom," commanded Ames."Good night,
Monsignor, good night.Remember, we dock at seven-thirty, sharp."Returning to the table, Ames sat down and rapidly composed a message
for his wireless operator to send across the dark waters to the city,
and thence to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, in Cartagena.This done, he
extinguished all the lights in the room excepting those which
illuminated the stained-glass windows above.Drawing his chair up in
front of the one which had stirred Lafelle's query, he sat before it
far into the morning, in absorbed contemplation, searching the sad
features of the beautiful face, pondering, revolving, sometimes
murmuring aloud, sometimes passing a hand across his brow, as if he
would erase from a relentless memory an impression made long since and
worn ever deeper by the recurrent thought of many years.CHAPTER 14


Almost within the brief period of a year, the barefoot, calico-clad
Carmen had been ejected from unknown Simiti and dropped into the midst
of the pyrotechnical society life of the great New World metropolis.Only an unusual interplay of mental forces could have brought about
such an odd result.But that it was a very logical outcome of the
reaction upon one another of human ambitions, fears, lust, and greed,
operating through the types of mind among which her life had been
cast, those who have followed our story thus far can have no doubt.The cusp of the upward-sweeping curve had been reached through the
insane eagerness of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to outdo her wealthy society
rivals in an arrogant display of dress, living, and vain, luxurious
entertaining, and the acquisition of the empty honor attaching to
social leadership.The coveted prize was now all but within the
shallow woman's grasp.she knew not that when her itching
fingers closed about it the golden bauble would crumble to ashes.The program as outlined by the Beaubien had been faithfully followed.Hawley-Crowles--whom, of course, she
had long desired to know more intimately--and an interchange of calls
had ensued, succeeded by a grand reception at the Ames mansion, the
first of the social season.Hawley-Crowles floated, as
upon a cloud, attired in a French gown which cost fifteen hundred
dollars, and shoes on her disproportioned feet for which she had
rejoiced to pay thirty dollars each, made as they had been from
specially selected imported leather, dyed to match her rich robe.It
was true, her pleasure had not been wholly unalloyed, for she had been
conscious of a trace of superciliousness on the part of some of the
gorgeous birds of paradise, twittering and hopping in their hampering
skirts about the Ames parlors, and pecking, with milk-fed content, at
the rare cakes and ices.But she only held her empty head the higher,
and fluttered about the more ostentatiously and clumsily, while
anticipating the effect which her charming and talented ward would
produce when she should make her bow to these same vain, haughty
devotees of the cult of gold.And she had wisely planned that Carmen's
_debut_ should follow that of Kathleen Ames, that it might eclipse her
rival's in its wanton display of magnificence.On the heels of the Ames reception surged the full flood of the
winter's social orgy.Early in November Kathleen Ames was duly
presented.The occasion was made one of such stupendous display that
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles first gasped, then shivered with apprehension,
lest she be unable to outdo it.She went home from it in a somewhat
chastened frame of mind, and sat down at her _escritoire_ to make
calculations.Could she on her meager annual income of one hundred and
fifty thousand hope to meet the Ames millions?She had already allowed
that her wardrobe would cost not less than twenty-five thousand
dollars a year, to say nothing of the additional expense of properly
dressing Carmen.But she now saw that this amount was hopelessly
inadequate.She therefore increased the figure to seventy-five
thousand.Could she maintain her
city home, entertain in the style now demanded by her social position,
and spend her summers at Newport, as she had planned?No, her income would not suffice; she would be obliged to
draw on the principal until Carmen could be married off to some
millionaire, or until her own father died.if he would only
terminate his useless existence soon!But, in lieu of that delayed desideratum, some expedient must be
devised at once.That obscure, retiring
woman was annually making her millions.A tip now and then from her, a
word of advice regarding the market, and her own limited income would
expand accordingly.She had not seen the Beaubien since becoming a
member of Holy Saints.But on that day, and again, two months later,
when the splendid altar to the late lamented and patriotic citizen,
the Honorable James Hawley-Crowles, was dedicated, she had marked the
woman, heavily veiled, sitting alone in the rear of the great church.She had shuddered as she
thought the tall, black-robed figure typified an ominous shadow
falling athwart her own foolish existence.But there was no doubt of Carmen's hold on the strange, tarnished
woman.And so, smothering her doubts and pocketing her pride, she
again sought the Beaubien, ostensibly in regard to Carmen's
forthcoming _debut_; and then, very adroitly and off-handedly, she
brought up the subject of investments, alleging that the added burden
of the young girl now rendered it necessary to increase the rate of
interest which her securities were yielding.The Beaubien proved herself the soul of candor and generosity.Not
only did she point out to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles how her modest income
might be quadrupled, but she even offered, in such a way as to make it
utterly impossible for that lady to take offense, to lend her whatever
amount she might need, at any time, to further Carmen's social
conquest.And during the conversation she announced that she herself
was acting on a suggestion dropped by the great financier, Ames, and
was buying certain stocks now being offered by a coming power in world
finance, Mr.Hawley-Crowles had heard of this man!Was he not
promoting a company in which her sister's husband, and the girl
herself, were interested?And if such investments were good enough for
a magnate of Ames's standing, they certainly were good enough for her.Indeed, why had she not thought of
this before!She would get Carmen to hypothecate her own interest in
this new company, if necessary.That interest of itself was worth a
fortune.Hawley-Crowles and Carmen so desired, the
Beaubien would advance them whatever they might need on that
security alone.Or, she would take the personal notes of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles--"For, you know, my dear," she said sweetly, "when
your father passes away you are going to be very well off, indeed, and
I can afford to discount that inevitable event somewhat, can I
not?"Hawley-Crowles soared into the empyrean, and this
self-absorbed woman, who never in her life had earned the equivalent
of a single day's food, launched the sweet, white-souled girl of
the tropics upon the oozy waters of New York society with such
_eclat_ that the Sunday newspapers devoted a whole page, profusely
illustrated, to the gorgeous event and dilated with much extravagance
of expression upon the charms of the little Inca princess, and
upon the very important and gratifying fact that the three hundred
fashionable guests present displayed jewels to the value of not less
than ten million dollars.The function took the form of a musicale, in which Carmen's rich
voice was first made known to the _beau monde_.The girl instantly
swept her auditors from their feet.The splendid pipe-organ, which
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles had hurriedly installed for the occasion,
became a thing inspired under her deft touch.It seemed in that
garish display of worldliness to voice her soul's purity, its
wonder, its astonishment, its lament over the vacuities of this
highest type of human society, its ominous threats of thundered
denunciation on the day when her tongue should be loosed and the
present mesmeric spell broken--for she was under a spell, even
that of this new world of tinsel and material veneer.Gannette wept on Carmen's shoulder, and went
home vowing that she would be a better woman and cut out her night-cap
of Scotch-and-soda.Others crowded about the girl and showered their
fulsome praise upon her.Ames and her daughter
Kathleen.They stared at the lovely _debutante_ with wonder and
chagrin written legibly upon their bepowdered visages.And before the
close of the function Kathleen had become so angrily jealous that she
was grossly rude to Carmen when she bade her good night.For her own
feeble light had been drowned in the powerful radiance of the girl
from Simiti.And from that moment the assassination of the character
of the little Inca princess was decreed.But, what with incessant striving to adapt herself to her environment,
that she might search its farthest nook and angle; what with ceaseless
efforts to check her almost momentary impulse to cry out against the
vulgar display of modernity and the vicious inequity of privilege
which she saw on every hand; what with her purity of thought; her rare
ideals and selfless motives; her boundless love for humanity; and her
passionate desire to so live her "message" that all the world might
see and light their lamps at the torch of her burning love for God and
her fellow-men, Carmen found her days a paradox, in that they were
literally full of emptiness.After her _debut_, event followed event
in the social life of the now thoroughly gay metropolis, and the poor
child found herself hustled home from one function, only to change her
attire and hurry again, weary of spirit, into the waiting car, to be
whisked off to another equally vapid.It seemed to the bewildered girl
that she would never learn what was _de rigueur_; what conventions
must be observed at one social event, but amended at another.Her
tight gowns and limb-hampering skirts typified the soul-limitation of
her tinsel, environment; her high-heeled shoes were exquisite torture;
and her corsets, which her French maid drew until the poor girl gasped
for air, seemed to her the cruellest device ever fashioned by the
vacuous, enslaved human mind.Frequently she changed her clothing
completely three and four times a day to meet her social demands.Night became day; and she had to learn to sleep until noon.She found
no time for study; none even for reading.And conversation, such as
was indulged under the Hawley-Crowles roof, was confined to insipid
society happenings, with frequent sprinklings of racy items anent
divorce, scandal, murder, or the debauch of manhood.From this she
drew more and more aloof and became daily quieter.It was seldom, too, that she could escape from the jaded circle of
society revelers long enough to spend a quiet hour with the Beaubien.But when she could, she would open the reservoirs of her soul and give
full vent to her pent-up emotions."Oh," she would often exclaim, as
she sat at the feet of the Beaubien in the quiet of the darkened music
room, and gazed into the crackling fire, "how can they--how can
they!"Then the Beaubien would pat her soft, glowing cheek and murmur, "Wait,
dearie, wait."And the tired girl would sigh and close her eyes and
dream of the quiet of little Simiti and of the dear ones there from
whom she now heard no word, and yet whom she might not seek, because
of the war which raged about her lowly birthplace.The gay season was hardly a month advanced when Mrs.Ames angrily
admitted to herself that her own crown was in gravest danger.The
South American girl--and because of her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her
blase sister--had completely captured New York's conspicuous circle.Hawley-Crowles apparently did not lack for funds, but entertained
with a display of reckless disregard for expense, and a carelessness
of critical comment, that stirred the city to its depths and aroused
expressions of wonder and admiration on every hand.The newspapers
were full of her and her charming ward.Surely, if the girl's social
prestige continued to soar, the Ames family soon would be relegated to
the social "has-beens."Ames and her haughty daughter held
many a serious conference over their dubious prospects.Night after night, when the Beaubien's dinner
guests had dispersed, he would linger to discuss the social war now in
full progress, and to exchange with her witty comments on the
successes of the combatants.One night he announced, "Lafelle is in
England; and when he returns he is coming by way of the West Indies.I
shall cable him to stop for a week at Cartagena, to see Wenceslas on a
little matter of business for me."Hawley-Crowles has become
nicely enmeshed in his net," she returned."The altar to friend Jim is
a beauty.Also, I hear that she is going to finance Ketchim's mining
company in Colombia.""I learned to-day that Ketchim's engineer, Harris,
has returned to the States.Couldn't get up the Magdalena river, on
account of the fighting.There will be nothing doing there for a year
yet.""Just as well," commented the Beaubien.Then abruptly--"By the way, I
now hold Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's notes to the amount of two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars.I want you to buy them from me and be ready to
turn the screws when I tell you."he exclaimed, pinching her
cheek.I'll take them off your hands to-morrow.And by the
way, I must meet this Carmen.""You let her alone," said the Beaubien quickly in a low voice.*       *       *       *       *

The inauguration of the Grand Opera season opened to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
another avenue for her astonishing social activities.With rare
shrewdness she had contrived to outwit Mrs.Ames and secure the center
box in the "golden horseshoe" at the Metropolitan.There, like a gaudy
garden spider in its glittering web, she sat on the opening night,
with her rapt _protegee_ at her side, and sent her insolent challenge
broadcast.Multimillionaires and their haughty, full-toileted dames were
ranged on either side of her, brewers and packers, distillers and
patent medicine concoctors, railroad magnates and Board of Trade
plungers, some under indictment, others under the shadow of death,
all under the mesmeric charm of gold.In the box at her left sat the
Ames family, with their newly arrived guests, the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her son.Ames was smiling
and affable when she exchanged calls with the gorgeous occupants of
the Hawley-Crowles box."So chawmed to meet you," murmured the heir of Altern, a callow youth
of twenty-three, bowing over the dainty, gloved hand of Carmen.Then,
as he adjusted his monocle and fixed his jaded eyes upon the fresh
young girl, "Bah Jove!"The gigantic form of Ames wedged in between the young man and Carmen."I've heard a lot about you," he said genially, in a heavy voice that
harmonized well with his huge frame; "but we haven't had an
opportunity to get acquainted until to-night."For some moments he stood holding her hand and looking steadily at
her.The girl gazed up at him with her trustful brown eyes alight, and
a smile playing about her mouth.While she chatted brightly Ames held her hand and laughed at her
frank, often witty, remarks.But then a curious, eager look came into
his face, and he became quiet and reflective.He seemed unable to take
his eyes from her.And when the girl gently drew her hand from his he
laughed again, nervously."I--I know something about Colombia," he said, "and speak the language
a bit.We'll have to get together often, so's I can brush up."Hawley-Crowles and her sister for the
first time--"Oh, so glad to see you both!Camorso's in fine voice
to-night, eh?"He wheeled about and stood again looking at Carmen, until she blushed
under his close gaze and turned her head away.But throughout the evening, whenever the girl looked in the
direction of the Ames family, she met the steady, piercing gaze of the
man's keen gray eyes.And they seemed to her like sharp steel points,
cutting into the portals of her soul.Night after night during the long season Carmen sat in the box and
studied the operas that were produced on the boards before her
wondering gaze.Hawley-Crowles was with her.And
generally, too, the young heir of Altern was there, occupying the
chair next to the girl--which was quite as the solicitous Mrs."Aw--deucedly fine show to-night, Miss Carmen," the youth ventured one
evening, as he took his accustomed place close to her."The music is always beautiful," the girl responded."But the play,
like most of Grand Opera, is drawn from the darkest side of human
life.It is a sordid picture of licentiousness and cruelty.Only for
its setting in wonderful music, Grand Opera is generally such a
depiction of sex-passion, of lust and murder, that it would not be
permitted on the stage.A few years from now people will be horrified
to remember that the preceding generation reveled in such blood
scenes--just as we now speak with horror of the gladiatorial contests
in ancient Rome.""But--aw--Miss Carmen," he
hazarded, "we must be true to life, you know!"Having delivered
himself of this oracular statement, the youth adjusted his monocle and
settled back as if he had given finality to a weighty argument."You voice the cant of the modern
writer, 'true lo life.'True to the horrible, human sense of life,
that looks no higher than the lust of blood, and is satisfied with it,
I admit.True to the unreal, temporal sense of existence, that is here
to-day, and to-morrow has gone out in the agony of self-imposed
suffering and death.True to that awful, false sense of life which we
must put off if we would ever rise into the consciousness of _real_
life, I grant you.But the production of these horrors on the stage,
even in a framework of marvelous music, serves only to hold before us
the awful models from which we must turn if we would hew out a better
existence.Are you the better for seeing an exhibition of wanton
murder on the stage, even though the participants wondrously sing
their words of vengeance and passion?""But--aw--they serve as warnings; they show us the things we ought not
to do, don't you know.""The sculptor who would chisel a beautiful form, does he
set before him the misshapen body of a hunchback, in order that he may
see what not to carve?""And we who would transform the
human sense of life into one of freedom from evil, can we build a
perfect structure with such grewsome models as this before us?You
don't see it now," she sighed; "you are in the world, and of it; and
the world is deeply under the mesmeric belief of evil as a stern
reality.But the day is coming when our musicians and authors will
turn from such base material as this to nobler themes--themes which
will excite our wonder and admiration, and stimulate the desire for
purity of thought and deed--themes that will be beacon lights, and
true guides.Hawley-Crowles frowned heavily as she listened to this
conversation, and she drew a sigh of relief when Carmen, sensing the
futility of any attempt to impress her thought upon the young man,
turned to topics which he could discuss with some degree of
intelligence.Late in the evening Ames dropped in and came directly to the
Hawley-Crowles box.He brought a huge box of imported candy and a
gorgeous bouquet of orchids, which he presented to Carmen.Hawley-Crowles beamed upon him like the effulgent midday sun."Kathleen wants you, Reggy," Ames abruptly announced to the young man,
whose lips were molding into a pout.His huge bulk loomed over the younger man like a
mountain as he took him by the shoulders and turned him toward the
exit.protested the youth, with a vain show
of resistance.Ames said nothing; but his domineering personality forced the boy out
of the box and into the corridor.Then he took the seat which his evicted nephew
had vacated, and bent over Carmen.With a final hopeless survey of the
situation, Reginald turned and descended to the cloak room, muttering
dire but futile threats against his irresistible relative.Ames's manner unconsciously assumed an air of
patronage."This is the first real opportunity I've had to talk with
you.Tell me, what do you think of New York?""Well," she began uncertainly, "since I have
thawed out, or perhaps have become more accustomed to the cold, I have
begun to make mental notes.But they
are not yet classified, and so I can hardly answer your question, Mr.But I am sure of one thing, and that is that for the first few
months I was here I was too cold to even think!""Yes," he agreed, "the change from the tropics was
somewhat abrupt."It is like awaking from a deep sleep," answered Carmen meditatively."In Simiti we dream our lives away.In New York all is action; loud
words; harsh commands; hurry; rush; endeavor, terrible, materialistic
endeavor!Every person I see seems to be going somewhere.He may not
know where he is going--but he is on the way.He may not know why he
is going--but he must not be stopped.He has so few years to live; and
he must pile up money before he goes.He must own an automobile; he
must do certain things which his more fortunate neighbor does, before
his little flame of life goes out and darkness falls upon him.I
sometimes think that people here are trying to get away from
themselves, but they don't know it.I think they come to the opera
because they crave any sort of diversion that will make them forget
themselves for a few moments, don't you?"well, I can't say," was Ames's meaningless reply, as he sat
regarding the girl curiously."And," she continued, as if pleased to have an auditor who at least
pretended to understand her, "the thing that now strikes me most
forcibly is the great confusion that prevails here in everything, in
your government, in your laws, in your business, in your society, and,
in particular, in your religion.Why, in that you have hundreds of
sects claiming a monopoly of truth; you have hundreds of churches,
hundreds of religious or theological beliefs, hundreds of differing
concepts of God--but you get nowhere!Why, it has come to such a pass
that, if Jesus were to appear physically on earth to-day, I am sure he
would be evicted from his own Church!""Well, yes, I guess that's so," commented Ames, quite at sea in such
conversation."But we solid business men have found that religious
emotion never gets a man anywhere.Makes a man
effeminate, and utterly unfits him for business.I wouldn't have a man
in my employ who was a religious enthusiast.""But Jesus was a religious enthusiast," she protested."I doubt if there ever was such a person," he answered dryly."Why, the Bible--"

"Is the most unfortunate and most misunderstood piece of literature
ever written," he interrupted."And the Church, well, I regard it as
the greatest fraud ever perpetrated upon the human race.""You mean that to apply to every church?"But their thoughts were running in widely divergent
channels.The conversational topic of the moment had no interest
whatsoever for the man.But this brilliant, sparkling girl--there was
something in those dark eyes, that soft voice, that brown hair--by
what anomaly did this beautiful creature come out of desolate,
mediaeval Simiti?Ames, you do not know what religion is.""It is that which binds us to God."No, he knew not the meaning of the word.His thought
broke restraint and flew wildly back--but he caught it, and rudely
forced it into its wonted channel.But, did he love his fellow-men?What would that profit him in dollars and cents?The thought brought a cynical laugh to
his lips.Carmen looked up at him wonderingly."You will have to, you
know," she said quixotically.Then she reached out a hand and laid it on his.He looked down at it,
so soft, so white, so small, and he contrasted it with the huge, hairy
bulk of his own.He felt it, felt
himself yielding.He was beginning to look beyond the beautiful
features, the rare grace and charm of physical personality, which had
at first attracted only the baser qualities of his nature, and was
seeing glimpses of a spiritual something which lay back of all
that--infinitely more beautiful, unspeakably richer, divine, sacred,
untouchable."Of course you will attend the Charity Ball, Mr.Hawley-Crowles jarred upon his ear like a shrill discord."But I shall be represented by my family.Hawley-Crowles, taking the query to
herself."That is, if my French dressmaker does not fail me.She
arched her brows at him as she propounded this innocent question."I'll tell you what it is this year," he sagely
replied.He gave a sententious nod of
his head."I overheard Kathleen and her mother discussing plans.And--do you want to know next season's innovation?He stopped and laughed heartily at his own treasonable
deceit.Hawley-Crowles eagerly, as she drew her
chair closer."One condition," replied Ames, holding up a thick finger."Well, I want to get better acquainted with your charming ward," he
whispered."Of course; and I want you to know her better." wigs," said Ames, with a knowing look.Hawley-Crowles settled back with a smile of supreme satisfaction.She would boldly anticipate next season at the coming Charity Ball.Then, leaning over toward Ames, she laid her fan upon his arm."Can't
you manage to come and see us some time, my sister and Carmen?"Just call me up a little in advance."The blare of trumpets and the crash of drums drew their attention
again to the stage.A business
associate in a distant box had beckoned him.Hawley-Crowles
dismissed him reluctantly; then turned her wandering attention to the
play.But Carmen sat shrouded in thoughts that were not stimulated by the
puppet-show before her.The tenor shrieked out his tender passion, and
the tubby soprano sank into his inadequate arms with languishing
sighs.Carmen heeded not their stage amours.She saw in the glare
before her the care-lined face of the priest of Simiti; she saw the
grim features and set jaw of her beloved, black-faced Rosendo, as he
led her through the dripping jungle; she saw Anita's blind, helpless
babe; she saw the little newsboy of Cartagena; and her heart welled
with a great love for them all; and she buried her face in her hands
and wept softly.CHAPTER 15

"Wait, my little princess, wait," the Beaubien had said, when Carmen,
her eyes flowing and her lips quivering, had again thrown herself into
that strange woman's arms and poured out her heart's surcease."I want to go back to Simiti, to Padre Jose, to my home," wailed the
girl."I don't understand the ways and the thoughts of these people.They don't know God--they don't know what love is--they don't know
anything but money, and clothes, and sin, and death.When I am with
them I gasp, I choke--"

"Yes, dearest, I understand," murmured the woman softly, as she
stroked the brown head nestling upon her shoulder.And many even of the 'four hundred' are suffering from the
same disease; but they would die rather than admit it.To no one could the attraction which had drawn Carmen and the Beaubien
together seem stranger, more inexplicable, than to that lone woman
herself.And both acknowledged it, nor
would have had it otherwise.To Carmen, the Beaubien was a sympathetic
confidante and a wise counselor.The girl knew nothing of the woman's
past or present life.She tried to see in her only the reality which
she sought in every individual--the reality which she felt that Jesus
must have seen clearly back of every frail mortal concept of humanity.And in doing this, who knows?--she may have transformed the sordid,
soiled woman of the world into something more than a broken semblance
of the image of God.To the Beaubien, this rare child, the symbol of
love, of purity, had become a divine talisman, touching a dead soul
into a sense of life before unknown.If Carmen leaned upon her, she,
on the other hand, bent daily closer to the beautiful girl; opened her
slowly warming heart daily wider to her; twined her lonely arms daily
closer about the radiant creature who had come so unexpectedly into
her empty, sinful life."But, mother dear"--the Beaubien had long since begged Carmen always
to address her thus when they were sharing alone these hours of
confidence--"they will not listen to my message!They laugh and jest
about real things!"And yet you tell me that the Bible says wise men
laughed at the great teacher, Jesus."And his message--oh, mother dearest, his message would have
helped them so, if they had only accepted it!It would have changed
their lives, healed their diseases, and saved them from death.And my
message"--her lip quivered--"my message is only his--it is the message
of love.But--I am so out of place among them.Their talk is so coarse, so
low and degraded.They don't
know what miserable failures they all are.Hawley-Crowles--"

The Beaubien's jaw set.--she will not let me speak of God in her house.She told me to keep
my views to myself and never voice them to her friends.And she says I
must marry either a millionaire or a foreign noble."And become a snobbish expatriate!Marry a decadent count, and
then shake the dust of this democratic country from your feet forever!Go to London or Paris or Vienna, and wear tiaras and coronets, and
speak of disgraceful, boorish America in hushed whispers!She forgets that the tarnished name she bears was
dragged up out of the ruck of the impecunious by me when I received
Jim Crowles into my house!And that I gave him what little gloss he
was able to take on!""Mother dear--I would leave them--only, they need love, oh, so much!"The Beaubien strained her to her bosom."They need you, dearie; they
little realize how they need you!I, myself, did not know until you
came to me.There, I didn't mean to let those tears get away from
me."She laughed softly as Carmen looked up anxiously into her face."Now come," she went on brightly, "we must plan for the Charity
Ball."A look of pain swept over the girl's face.The Beaubien bent and
kissed her."You will not leave society
voluntarily.They
will light their own lamps at yours--or they will thrust you from
their doors.And then," she muttered, as her teeth snapped together,
"you will come to me."Close on the heels of the opera season followed the Charity Ball, the
Horse Show, and the Fashion Show in rapid succession, with numberless
receptions, formal parties, and nondescript social junketings
interspersed.During these fleeting hours of splash and glitter Mrs.Hawley-Crowles trod the air with the sang-froid and exhilaration of an
expert aviator.Backed by the Beaubien millions, and with the
wonderful South American girl always at her right hand, the
worldly ambitious woman swept everything before her, cut a social
swath far wider than the glowering Mrs.Ames had ever attempted, and
marched straight to the goal of social leadership, almost without
interference.She had apparently achieved other successes, too, of
the first importance.She had secured the assistance of Ames himself
in matters pertaining to her finances; and the Beaubien was
actively cooeperating with her in the social advancement of Carmen.It is true, she gasped whenever her thought wandered to her notes
which the Beaubien held, notes which demanded every penny of her
principal as collateral.And she often meditated very soberly over
the large sums which she had put into the purchase of Simiti stock,
at the whispered suggestions of Ames, and under the irresistibly
pious and persuasive eloquence of Philip O. Ketchim, now president
of that flourishing but as yet non-productive company.But then, one
day, an idea occurred to her, and she forthwith summoned Carmen into
the library."You see, my dear," she said, after expounding to the girl certain of
her thoughts anent the famous mine, "I do not want Mr.Ketchim to have
any claim upon you for the expense which he incurred on account of
your six months in the Elwin school.That thought, as well as others
relating to your complete protection, makes it seem advisable that you
transfer to me your share in the mine, or in the Simiti company.See,
I give you a receipt for the same, showing that you have done this as
part payment for the great expense to which I have been put in
introducing you to society and in providing for your wants here.It is
merely formal, of course.And it keeps your share still in our
family, of which you are and always will be a member; but yet removes
all liability from you.Of course, you know nothing about business
matters, and so you must trust me implicitly.Which I am sure you do,
in view of what I have done for you, don't you, dear?"Of course Carmen did; and of course she unhesitatingly transferred her
claim on La Libertad to the worthy Mrs.Whereupon the
good woman tenderly kissed the innocent child, and clasped a string of
rich pearls about the slender, white neck.And Carmen later told the
Beaubien, who said nothing, but frowned darkly as she repeated the
tidings over her private wire to J. Wilton Ames.But that priest of
finance only chuckled and exclaimed: "Excellent, my dear!By the way, I had a cable from Lafelle this morning, from
Cartagena.But the
Beaubien hung up the receiver with a presentiment that everything was
far from right, despite his bland assurance.And she regretted
bitterly now that she had not warned Carmen against this very thing.The Charity Ball that season was doubtless the most brilliant function
of its kind ever held among a people who deny the impossible.The
newspapers had long vied with one another in their advertisements and
predictions; they afterward strove mightily to outdo themselves in
their vivid descriptions of the gorgeous _fete_.The decorative
effects far excelled anything ever attempted in the name of
"practical" charity.The display of gowns had never before been even
closely approximated.The scintillations from jewels whose value
mounted into millions was like the continuous flash of the electric
spark.And the huge assemblage embraced the very cream of the
nobility, the aristocracy, the rich and exclusive caste of a great
people whose Constitution is founded on the equality of men, and who
are wont to gather thus annually for a few hours to parade their
material vestments and divert their dispirited mentalities under the
guise of benefaction to a class for whom they rarely hold a loving
thought.Hawley-Crowles had planned and executed a _coup_.Ames had subscribed the munificent sum of twenty-five thousand
dollars to charity a week before the ball.Hawley-Crowles had
waited for this.Then she gloated as she telephoned to the various
newspaper offices that her subscription would be fifty thousand.Did
she give a new note to the Beaubien for this amount?That she
did--and she obtained the money on the condition that the little Inca
princess should lead the grand march.Hawley-Crowles
knew that she must gracefully yield first place to the South American
girl; and yet she contrived to score a triumph in apparent defeat.Ames and her daughter Kathleen at the
last moment refused to attend the function, alleging fatigue from a
season unusually exacting.Hawley-Crowles had
previously secured the languid young Duke of Altern as a partner for
Carmen--and then was most agreeably thwarted by Ames himself, who,
learning that his wife and daughter would not attend, abruptly
announced that he himself would lead the march with Carmen.Was it not quite proper that the city's leading man of
finance should, in the absence of his wife and daughter, and with
their full and gratuitous permission--nay, at their urgent request, so
it was told--lead with this fair young damsel, this tropical flower,
who, as rumor had it, was doubtless a descendant of the royal dwellers
in ancient Cuzco?"Quite proper, _O tempora, O mores_!"murmured one Amos A. Hitt,
erstwhile Presbyterian divine, explorer, and gentleman of leisure, as
he settled back in his armchair in the fashionable Weltmore apartments
and exhaled a long stream of tobacco smoke through his wide nostrils."And, if I can procure a ticket, I shall give myself the pleasure of
witnessing this sacred spectacle, produced under the deceptive mask of
charity," he added.In vain the Beaubien labored with Ames when she learned of his
intention--though she said nothing to Carmen.Ames had yielded to her
previously expressed wish that he refrain from calling at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion, or attempting to force his attentions upon the
young girl.But in this matter he remained characteristically
obdurate.For the angry
Beaubien, striving to shield the innocent girl, had vented her
abundant wrath upon the affable Ames, and had concluded her
denunciation with a hint of possible exposure of certain dark facts of
which she was sole custodian.Ames smiled, bowed, and courteously
kissed her hand, as he left her stormy presence; but he did not yield.Through the perfumed air and the garish light tore the crashing notes
of the great band.The loud hum of voices ceased, and all eyes turned
to the leaders of the grand march, as they stepped forth at one end of
the great auditorium.Then an involuntary murmur arose from the
multitude--a murmur of admiration, of astonishment, of envy.The
gigantic form of Ames stood like a towering pillar, the embodiment of
potential force, the epitome of human power, physical and mental.His
massive shoulders were thrown back as if in haughty defiance of
comment, critical or commendatory.The smile which flitted about his
strong, clean-shaven face bespoke the same caution as the gentle
uplifting of a tiger's paw--behind it lay all that was humanly
terrible, cunning, heartless, and yet, in a sense, fascinating.His
thick, brown hair, scarcely touched with gray, lay about his great
head like a lion's mane.He raised a hand and gently pushed it back
over the lofty brow.Then he bent and offered an arm to the slender
wisp of a girl at his side.murmured a tall, angular man in the crowd."I don't know, Hitt," replied the friend addressed."But they say she
belongs to the Inca race."The graceful girl moving by the side of her giant escort seemed like a
slender ray of light, a radiant, elfish form, transparent, intangible,
gliding softly along with a huge, black shadow.She was simply clad,
all in white.About her neck hung a string of pearls, and at her waist
she wore the rare orchids which Ames had sent her that afternoon.No one marked the pure simplicity of her attire.The absence of sparkling jewels and resplendent raiment evoked no
comment.The multitude saw but her wonderful face; her big eyes,
uplifted in trustful innocence to the massive form at her side; her
rich brown hair, which glittered like string-gold in the strong light
that fell in torrents upon it.There's a nimbus about her head!""I could almost believe it," whispered that gentleman, straining his
long neck as she passed before him.Immediately behind Carmen and Ames strode the enraptured Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who saw not, neither heard, and who longed for no
further taste of heaven than this stupendous triumph which she had won
for herself and the girl.Her heavy, unshapely form was squeezed into
a marvelous costume of gold brocade.A double ballet ruffle of stiff
white tulle encircled it about the hips as a drapery.The bodice was
of heavy gold net.A pleated band of pale moire, in a delicate shade
of pink, crossed the left shoulder and was caught at the waist in a
large rose bow, ambassadorial style.A double necklace of diamonds,
one bearing a great pendant of emeralds, and the other an alternation
of emeralds and diamonds, encircled her short, thick neck.A diamond
coronet fitted well around her wonderful amber- wig--for, true
to her determination, she had anticipated the now _passee_ Mrs.Ames
and had boldly launched the innovation of  wigs among the smart
set.An ivory, hand-painted fan, of great value, dangled from her
thick wrist.And, as she lifted her skirts to an unnecessary height,
the gaping people caught the glitter of a row of diamonds in each
high, gilded heel.At her side the young Duke of Altern shuffled, his long, thin body
curved like a kangaroo, and his monocle bent superciliously upon the
mass of common clay about him."Aw, beastly crush, ye know," he
murmured from time to time to the unhearing dame at his right.And
then, as she replied not, he fell to wondering if she fully realized
who he was.Around and across the great hall the gorgeous pageant swept.The
big-mouthed horns bellowed forth their noisy harmony.In the distant
corridors great illuminated fountains softly plashed.At the tables
beyond, sedulous, touting waiters were hurriedly extracting corks from
frosted bottle necks.The rare porcelain and cut glass shone and
glittered in rainbow tints.The revelers waxed increasingly merry and
care-free as they lightly discussed poverty over rich viands and
sparkling Burgundy.Still further beyond, the massive oak doors, with
their leaded-glass panes, shut out the dark night and the bitter
blasts of winter.And they shut out, too, another, but none the less
unreal, externalization of the mortal thought which has found
expression in a social system "too wicked for a smile.""God, no--I'd get arrested!The frail, hungry woman who stood before the great doors clutched her
wretched shawl closer about her thin shoulders.Her teeth chattered as
she stood shivering in the chill wind.At the corner of the building the cold blast almost swept her off her
feet.A man, dirty and unkempt, who had been waiting in an alley, ran
out and seized her."I say, Jude, ain't ye goin' in?Git arrested--ye'd spend the night in
a warm cell, an' that's better'n our bunk, ain't it?""I'm goin' to French Lucy's," the woman whispered hoarsely.Ye've lost yer looks, Jude, an' ol' Lucy ain't a-goin' to take
ye in.We gotta snipe somepin quick--or starve!Look, we'll go down to
Mike's place, an' then come back here when it's out, and ye kin pinch
a string, or somepin, eh?For a moment she stood listening
to the music from within.A sob shook her, and she began to cough
violently.The man took her arm, not unkindly; and together they moved
away into the night.*       *       *       *       *

"Well, little girl, at last we are alone.He had, late in the evening,
secured seats well hidden behind a mass of palms, and thither had led
Carmen.Ever see
anything like this in Simiti?"She was
glad to get away for a moment from the crowd, from the confusion, and
from the unwelcome attentions of the now thoroughly smitten young Duke
of Altern."No," she finally made answer, "I didn't know there were such things
in the world."A new toy--one that would last a long time."Yes," he went on genially, "I'll wager there's millions of dollars'
worth of jewelry here to-night.""And are the people going to sell it and give the
money to the poor?""But--this is a--a charity--"

"Oh, I see.No, it's the money derived from the sale of
tickets that goes to the poor.""But--aren't you interested in the poor?""Of course, of course," he hastened to assure her, in his easy casual
tone.For a long time the girl sat reflecting, while he studied her,
speculating eagerly on her next remark.Then it came abruptly:

"Mr.Ames, I have thought a great deal about it, and I think you
people by your charity, such as this, only make more charity
necessary.Why don't you do away with poverty altogether?"Well, that's quite impossible, you know.'The poor
ye have always with you', eh?She was
deeply serious, for charity to her meant love, and love was all in
all."No," she finally replied, shaking her head, "you do _not_ know your
Bible.It is the poor thought that you have always with you, the
thought of separation from good.And that thought becomes manifested
outwardly in what is called poverty."He regarded her quizzically, while a smile played about his mouth."Why don't you get at the very root of the trouble, and destroy the
poverty-thought, the thought that there can be any separation from
God, who is infinite good?""Well, my dear girl, as for me, I don't know anything about God.As
for you, well, you are very innocent in worldly matters.Poverty, like
death, is inevitable, you know.""Well, well," he returned brightly, "that's good news!Then there is
no such thing as 'the survival of the fittest,' and the weak needn't
necessarily sink, eh?"Ames, that
you have survived as one of the fittest?"Well, now--what would you say about that?""I should say decidedly no," was the blunt reply.A dark shade crossed his face, and he bit his lip.People did not
generally talk thus to him.And yet--this wisp of a girl!how beautiful, as she sat there
beside him, her head erect, and her face delicately flushed.He
reached over and took her hand."You are the kind," she went on, "who give money to the poor, and then
take it away from them again.All the money which these rich people
here to-night are giving to charity has been wrested from the poor.And you give only a part of it back to them, at that.This Ball is
just a show, a show of dress and jewels.Why, it only sets an example
which makes others unhappy, envious, and discontented."My dear little girl," he said in a patronizing tone, "don't you think
you are assuming a great deal?I'm sure I'm not half so bad as you
paint me.""Well, the money you give away has got to come from
some source, hasn't it?And you manipulate the stock market and put
through wheat corners and all that, and catch the poor people and take
their money from them!But your idea of charity makes
me pity you.Up here I find a man can pile up hundreds of millions by
stifling competition, by debauching legislatures, by piracy and
legalized theft, and then give a tenth of it to found a university,
and so atone for his crimes.Oh, I know a lot
about such things!I've been studying and thinking a great deal since
I came to the United States."And there was a touch of
aspersion in his voice."I've come with a message," she replied eagerly."Well," he said sharply, "let me warn and advise you: don't join the
ranks of the muck-rakers, as most ambitious reformers with messages
do.I can tear down as easily as you or
anybody else.But to build something better is entirely another
matter.""Well, what is it, if I may
ask?"Well, perhaps that's so," he said, bending toward her and
again attempting to take her hand."I guess," she said, drawing back quickly, "you don't know what love
is, do you?""Of course I will," she said brightly.And you'll have to do just as I tell you," holding up an admonitory
finger."I'm yours to command, little woman," he returned in mock seriousness."Well," she began very softly, "you must first learn that love is just
as much a principle as the Binomial Theorem in algebra.And you must apply it just as you would apply any
principle, to everything."You sweet little thing," he murmured absently, gazing down into her
glowing face.I
wonder--I wonder if you really are a daughter of the Incas.""Yes," she said, "I am a
princess."You look like--I wonder--pshaw!"And--do you know?--I wish I might
be your prince."But then her bright
smile faded, and she looked off wistfully down the long corridor."I'll send him a challenge
to-night!""No," she murmured gently, "you can't.And,
oh, he was so good to me!He made me leave that country on account of
the war."This innocent girl little knew that one of
the instigators of that bloody revolution sat there beside her.Then a
new thought flashed into his brain."What is the full name of this
priest?""Jose--Jose de Rincon," she whispered reverently.Jose de Rincon--of Simiti--whom Wenceslas had made the scapegoat of
the revolution!And who, according to a
recent report from Wenceslas, had been arrested and--

"A--a--where did you say this--this Jose was, little girl?"You know, he never was a priest at heart.But, though he saw the
truth, in part, he was not able to prove it enough to set himself
free; and so when I came away he stayed behind to work out his
problem.And he will work it all out," she mused abstractedly, looking
off into the distance; "he will work it all out and come--to me.I
am--I am working with him, now--and for him.And--" her voice dropped
to a whisper, "I love him, oh, so much!"His mouth opened; then shut again with a
sharp snap.That beautiful creature now belonged to him, and to none
other!Were there other claimants, he would crush them without mercy!As for this apostate priest, Jose--humph!if he still lived he should
rot the rest of his days in the reeking dungeons of San Fernando!"When he comes to me," she said softly, "we are
going to give ourselves to the whole world.""And--perhaps--perhaps, by that time, you will be--be--"

"Well?"snapped the man, irritated by the return of her thought to
himself.Perhaps by that time you will--you will love everybody," she
murmured."Perhaps you won't go on piling up big mountains of money
that you can't use, and that you won't let anybody else use.""You will know then that Jesus founded his great empire on love.Your
empire, you know, is human business.But you will find that such
empires crumble and fall."Say," he exclaimed, turning full upon her and seeming to bear her
down by his tremendous personality, "you young and inexperienced
reformers might learn a few things, too, if your prejudices could be
surmounted.Has it ever occurred to you that we men of business think
not so much about accumulating money as about achieving success?Do
you suppose you could understand that money-making is but a side issue
with us?""Yes," the girl went on, as if in quiet soliloquy, "I suppose you
are--a tremendous worldly success.And this Ball--it is a splendid
success, too.Thousands of dollars will be raised for the poor.And
then, next year, the same thing will have to be done again.Your
charities cost you hundreds of millions every year up here.And,
meantime, you rich men will go right on making more money at the
expense of your fellow-men--and you will give a little of it to the
poor when the next Charity Ball comes around.It's like a circle,
isn't it?"she said, smiling queerly up at him."It has no end, you
know."Ames had now decided to swallow his annoyance and meet the girl with
the lance of frivolity."Yes, I guess that's so," he began."But of
course you will admit that the world is slowly getting better, and
that world-progress must of necessity be gradual.We can't reform all
in a minute, can we?""I don't know how fast you might reform if you
really, sincerely tried.And if
you, a great, big, powerful man, with the most wonderful opportunities
in the world, should really try to be a success, why--well, I'm sure
you'd make very rapid progress, and help others like you by setting
such a great example.For you are a wonderful man--you really are."Ames looked at her long and quizzically.Then
he took her hand, this time without resistance."Tell me, little girl--although I know there can be no doubt of
it--are you a success?"he ejaculated, "would
you mind telling me just why?"She smiled up at him, and her sweet trustfulness drew his sagging
heartstrings suddenly taut."Because," she said simply, "I strive every moment to 'acquire that
mind which was in Christ Jesus.'"From amusement to wonder, to irritation, to
anger, then to astonishment, and a final approximation to something
akin to reverent awe had been the swift course of the man's emotions
as he sat in this secluded nook beside this strange girl.The
poisoned arrows of his worldly thought had broken one by one against
the shield of her protecting faith.His badinage had returned to
confound himself.The desire to possess had utterly fled before the
conviction that such thought was as wildly impossible as iniquitous.Then he suddenly became conscious that the little body beside him had
drawn closer--that it was pressing against him--that a little hand had
stolen gently into his--and that a soft voice, soft as the summer
winds that sigh among the roses, was floating to his ears."To be really great is to be like that wonderful man, Jesus.It is to
know that through him the great Christ-principle worked and did those
things which the world will not accept, because it thinks them
miracles.It is to know that God is love, and to act that knowledge.It is to know that love is the Christ-principle, and that it will
destroy every error, every discord, everything that is unlike itself.It is to yield your present false sense of happiness and good to the
true sense of God as infinite good.It is to bring every thought into
captivity to this Christ-principle, love.It is to stop looking at
evil as a reality.It is to let go your hold on it, and let it fade
away before the wonderful truth that God is everywhere, and that there
isn't anything apart from Him.*       *       *       *       *

How long they sat in the quiet that followed, neither knew.Then the
man suffered himself to be led silently back to the ball room again.And when he had recovered and restored his worldly self, the bright
little image was no longer at his side."Stand here, Jude, an' when they begins to come out to their gasoline
carts grab anything ye can, an' git.The shivering woman crept closer to the curb, and the man slouched
back against the wall close to the exit from which the revelers would
soon emerge.A distant clock over a jeweler's window chimed the hour
of four.A moment later the door opened, and a lackey came out and
loudly called the number of the Hawley-Crowles car.That ecstatically
happy woman, with Carmen and the obsequious young Duke of Altern,
appeared behind him in the flood of light.As the big car drew softly up, the wretched creature whom the man had
called Jude darted from behind it and plunged full at Carmen.But the
girl had seen her coming, and she met her with outstretched arm.The
glare from the open door fell full upon them.With a quick movement the girl
tore the string of pearls from her neck and thrust it into Jude's
hand.The latter turned swiftly and darted into the blackness of the
street.Then Carmen hurriedly entered the car, followed by her
stupefied companions.It had all been done in a moment of time.Hawley-Crowles, when she had recovered her
composure sufficiently to speak.And the Duke of Altern rubbed his weak eyes
and tried hard to think.Hawley-Crowles sought her bed that morning the east was
red with the winter sun."The loss of the pearls is bad enough," she
exclaimed in conclusion, glowering over the young girl who sat before
her, "for I paid a good three thousand for the string!But, in
addition, to scandalize me before the world--oh, how could you?And
this unspeakable Jude--and that awful house--heavens, girl!Who would
believe your story if it should get out?"The worried woman's face was
bathed in cold perspiration."But--she saved me from--from that place," protested the harassed
Carmen."She was poor and cold--I could see that.Why should I have
things that I don't need when others are starving?"Hawley-Crowles shook her weary head in despair.Reed, who had sat fixing the girl with her cold eyes throughout the
stormy interview following their return from the ball, now offered a
suggestion."The thing to do is to telephone immediately to all the
newspapers, and say that her beads were stolen last night.""But they weren't stolen," asserted the girl."I gave them to her--"

"Go to your room!"Hawley-Crowles, at the limit of her
endurance."And never, under any circumstances, speak of this affair
to any one--never!"The social crown, which had rested none too securely upon the gilded
wig of the dynamic Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, had been given a jolt that set
it tottering.*       *       *       *       *

It was very clear to Mrs.J. Wilton Ames after the Charity Ball that
she was engaged in a warfare to the death, and with the most
relentless of enemies.Nothing short of the miraculous could now
dethrone the detested Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her beautiful,
mysterious ward.She dolefully acknowledged to herself and to the
sulking Kathleen that she had been asleep, that she had let her foot
slip, and that her own husband's conduct in leading the grand march
with Carmen bade fair to give the _coup de grace_ to a social prestige
which for many weeks had been decidedly on the wane."Mamma, we'll have to think up some new stunts," said the dejected
Kathleen over the teacups the noon following the ball."Why, they've
even broken into the front page of the newspapers with a fake jewelry
theft!Look, they pretend that the little minx was robbed of her
string of pearls last night on leaving the hall.Ames's lip curled in disdain as she read the news item."An Inca
princess, indeed!Why doesn't
somebody take the trouble to investigate her?They'd probably find her
an outcast.""Couldn't papa look her up?"She had no wish to discuss her husband, after
the affair of the previous evening.And, even in disregard of that,
she would not have gone to him with the matter.For she and her
consort, though living under the same roof, nevertheless saw each
other but seldom.At times they met in the household elevator; and for
the sake of appearances they managed to dine together with Kathleen in
a strained, unnatural way two or three times a week, at which times no
mention was ever made of the son who had been driven from the parental
roof.There were no exchanges of confidences or affection, and Mrs.Ames knew but little of the working of his mentality.She was wholly
under the dominance of her masterful husband, merely an accessory to
his mode of existence.He used her, as he did countless others, to
buttress a certain side of his very complex life.As for assistance in
determining Carmen's status, there was none to be obtained from him,
strongly attracted by the young girl as he had already shown himself
to be.Indeed, she might be grateful if the attachment did not lead to
far unhappier consequences!"Larry Beers said yesterday that he had something new," she replied
irrelevantly to Kathleen's question."He has in tow a Persian dervish,
who sticks knives through his mouth, and drinks melted lead, and bites
red-hot pokers, and a lot of such things.Larry says he's the most
wonderful he's ever seen, and I'm going to have him and a real Hindu
_swami_ for next Wednesday evening."New York's conspicuous set indeed would have languished often but for
the social buffoonery of the clever Larry Beers, who devised new
diversions and stimulating mental condiments for the jaded brains of
that gilded cult.His table ballets, his bizarre parlor circuses, his
cunningly devised fads in which he set forth his own inimitable
antics, won him the motley and the cap and bells of this tinseled
court, and forced him well out into the glare of publicity, which was
what he so much desired.And by that much it made him as dangerous as any stupid anarchist who
toils by candle-light over his crude bombs.For by it he taught the
great mass of citizenship who still retained their simple ideals of
reason and respect that there existed a social caste, worshipers of
the golden calf, to whom the simple, humdrum virtues were quite
unendurable, and who, utterly devoid of conscience, would quaff
champagne and dance on the raw, quivering hearts of their fellow-men
with glee, if thereby their jaded appetites for novelty and
entertainment might be for the moment appeased.And so Larry Beers brought his _swami_ and dervish to the Ames
mansion, and caused his hostess to be well advertised in the
newspapers the following day.And he caused the eyes of Carmen to
bulge, and her thought to swell with wonder, as she gazed.And he
caused the bepowdered nose of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to stand a bit
closer to the perpendicular, while she sat devising schemes to cast a
shade over this clumsy entertainment.The chief result was that, a week later, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, still
running true to form, retorted with a superb imitation of the French
_Bal de l'Opera_, once so notable under the Empire.The Beaubien had
furnished the inspiring idea--and the hard cash."Why do I continue
to lend her money and take her notes?I don't--I don't seem to feel that way now.Or is it because I hate that Ames woman so?I wonder if I do still
hate her?At any rate I'm glad to see Carmen oust the proud hussy from
her place.It's worth all I've spent, even if I burn the notes I hold
against Jim Crowles's widow."And often after that, when at night the Beaubien had sought her bed,
she would lie for hours in the dim light meditating, wondering.I'm not the same woman I was when she came into my life.Oh,
God bless her--if there is a God!"The mock _Bal de l'Opera_ was a magnificent _fete_.All the members of
the smart set were present, and many appeared in costumes representing
flowers, birds, and vegetables.Carmen went as a white rose; and her
great natural beauty, set off by an exquisite costume, made her the
fairest flower of the whole garden.The Duke of Altern, costumed as a
long carrot, fawned in her wake throughout the evening.The tubbily
girthy Gannette, dressed to represent a cabbage, opposed her every
step as he bobbed before her, showering his viscous compliments upon
the graceful creature.Kathleen Ames appeared as a bluebird; and she
would have picked the fair white rose to pieces if she could, so
wildly jealous did she become at the sight of Carmen's further
triumph.About midnight, when the revelry was at its height, a door at the end
of the hall swung open, and a strong searchlight was turned full upon
it.The orchestra burst into the wailing dead march from _Saul_, and
out through the glare of light stalked the giant form of J. Wilton
Ames, gowned in dead black to represent a King Vulture, and with a
blood-red fez surmounting his cruel mask.As he stepped out upon the
platform which had been constructed to represent the famous bridge in
"_Sumurun_," and strode toward the main floor, a murmur involuntarily
rose from the assemblage.It was a murmur of awe, of horror, of fear.The "_monstrum horrendum_" of Poe was descending upon them in the garb
which alone could fully typify the character of the man!When he
reached the end of the bridge the huge creature stopped and distended
his enormous sable wings.cried Gannette, as he thought of his tremendous financial
obligations to Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away from the awful spectacle."I want to
go," she said to the petrified Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had known
nothing of this feature of the program.Straight to the trembling, white-clad girl the great, black vulture
stalked.The revelers fell away from him on either side as he
approached.Carmen turned again and watched him come.A light came into her eyes, and a smile
wreathed her mouth.And when Ames reached her and extended his huge,
black wings again, she walked straight into them with a look of joy
upon her beautiful face.Then the wings closed and completely hid the
fair, white form from the gaping crowd.For a few moments dead silence reigned throughout the hall.Then the
orchestra crashed, the vulture's wings slowly opened, and the girl,
who would have gone to the stake with the same incomprehensible smile,
stepped out.The black monster turned and strode silently, ominously,
back to the end of the hall, crossed the bridge, and disappeared
through the door which opened at his approach.said the shaken Gannette to his perspiring wife.That girl's done for; and Ames has taken this
way to publicly announce the fact!There was another astonished watcher in the audience that evening.It
was the eminent Monsignor Lafelle, recently back from Europe by way of
the West Indies.And after the episode just related, he approached
Carmen and Mrs."A very clever, if startling, performance," he commented; "and with
two superb actors, Mr.Ames and our little friend here," bowing over
Carmen's hand."I am _so_ glad you could accept our invitation, Monsignor.I haven't got my breath yet," panted the steaming Mrs."Do take us, Monsignor, to the refectory.A few moments later, over their iced drinks, Lafelle was relating
vivid incidents of his recent travels, and odd bits of news from
Cartagena."No, Miss Carmen," he said, in reply to her anxious
inquiries, "I did not meet the persons you have mentioned.And as for
getting up the Magdalena river, it would have been quite impossible.Dismiss from your mind all thought of going down there now.And the
little town of Simiti which you mention, I doubt not it is quite shut
off from the world by the war."Carmen turned aside that he might not see the tears which welled into
her eyes."Your entertainment, Madam," continued Lafelle, addressing the now
recovered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "is superb, as have been all of your
social projects this winter, I learn.The thought which you expressed
to me some months ago regarding Catholic activity in social matters
certainly was well founded.I perceive that our Protestant rivals have
all but retired from the field."Hawley-Crowles swelled with pride.Carmen regarded the churchman
with wonder."And have you not found a sense of peace, of satisfaction and comfort,
since you united with the true Church?""Are you not
at last at rest?""Quite so," sighed the lady, though the sigh was scarcely one of
unalloyed relief."And our little friend here--can she still
remain an alien, now that she has some knowledge of her indebtedness
to the Church?""Why--"

It was now Lafelle's turn to sigh, as he directed himself again to
Mrs."She does not see, Madam, that it was by the
ladder of Holy Church that she mounted to her present enviable social
height.""But--what--what do you mean?""May I not come and explain it to her?"Then he suddenly
thought of his last conversation with the Beaubien.But he shrugged
his shoulders, and a defiant look sat upon his features.Hawley-Crowles dared not refuse the request.She knew she was now
too deeply enmeshed for resistance, and that Lafelle's control over
her was complete--unless she dared to face social and financial ruin.And under that thought she paled and grew faint, for it raised the
curtain upon chaos and black night."Would it be convenient for me to call to-morrow afternoon?"Hawley-Crowles in a scarcely audible
voice."By the way," Lafelle said, suddenly turning the conversation, "how,
may I ask, is our friend, Madam Beaubien?"Hawley-Crowles again trembled slightly."I--I have not seen her
much of late, Monsignor," she said feebly."A strong and very liberal-minded woman," returned Lafelle with
emphasis."I trust, as your spiritual adviser, Madam, I may express
the hope that you are in no way influenced by her."cried Carmen, who had bounded to her feet, her eyes ablaze,
"Madam Beaubien is a noble woman!"Lafelle grasped her hand and drew her back into her
chair.Madam Beaubien is a very dear
friend of ours, and we greatly admire her strength of character.She
certainly does not require your defense!A few moments later he rose and offered his arms to his companions to
lead them back to the hall.Delivering Carmen into the charge of the
eagerly waiting Duke of Altern, Lafelle remarked, as he took leave of
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I trust you will permit me to talk with your
beautiful ward to-morrow afternoon--alone."And when the lady
interpreted the significance of his look, her heart beat rapidly, as
she bowed her acknowledgment of abject submission.ejaculated the young Duke, clutching Carmen."Ye know, I
was deucedly afraid you had gone home, or that Uncle Wilton had you.Ye know, I think I'm jealous of him!"Carmen laughed merrily at the fellow.His grotesque costume made him
appear still more ridiculous."It's nothing to laugh at, Miss Carmen!It's a bally bore to have a
regular mountain like him always getting in the way; and to-night I
just made up my mind I wouldn't stand it any longer, bah Jove!He fixed his monocle savagely in his eye and strode rapidly toward
the refreshment hall.She heard his murmur of
gratification when his gaze lighted upon the chairs and table which
he had evidently arranged previously in anticipation of this
_tete-a-tete_."Ye know," he finally began, after they were seated and he had sat
some minutes staring at the girl, "ye know, you're deucedly clevah,
Miss Carmen!I told mother so to-day, and this time she had to agree.And that about your being an Inca princess--ye know, I could see that
from the very first day I met you.Mighty romantic, and all that,
don't ye know!"replied the girl, her thought drifting back to distant
Simiti."And all about that mine you own in South America--and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles making you her heiress--and all that--bah Jove!It's--it's romantic, I tell you!"His head continued to nod emphasis
to his thought long after he finished speaking."Ye know," he finally resumed, drawing a gold-crested case from a
pocket and lighting a monogrammed cigarette, "a fellow can always tell
another who is--well, who belongs to the aristocracy.Ames, ye
know, said she had some suspicions about you.But I could see right
off that it was because she was jealous.Mother and I knew what you
were the minute we clapped eyes on you.That's because we belong to
the nobility, ye know.""Bah Jove, Miss Carmen, I'm going to say it!""Mother wanted me to marry Lord Cragmont's filly; but, bah Jove, I
say, I'm going to marry you!"Carmen now heard, and she quickly sat up, her eyes wide and staring.You're a princess, ye know,
and so you're in our class.I'm not one of the kind that hands out a
title to the red-nosed daughter of any American pork packer just to
get her money.The girl I marry has got to be my equal.""It's all right for you to have money, of course.I won't marry a
pauper, even if she's a duchess.But you and I, Miss Carmen, are just
suited to each other--wealth and nobility on each side.I've got
thirty thousand good British acres in my own right, bah Jove!"By now Carmen had fully recovered from her surprise.She reflected a
moment, then determined to meet the absurd youth with the spirit of
levity which his audacity merited."But, Reginald," she said in mock
seriousness, "though your father was a duke, how about your mother?Was she not just an ordinary American girl, a sister of plain Mrs.Now on my side--"

"Now, Miss Carmen," cried the boy petulantly, "can't you see that, by
marrying my father, my mother became ennobled?Bah Jove, you don't
understand!he whispered, leaning far over the table toward her."Then we've simply _got_ to marry!""But," protested the girl, "in my country people love those whom they
marry.I haven't heard a word of that from you."It was
love that made me offer you my name and title!""My dear Reginald, you don't love me.You are madly in love, it is true; but it is
with the young Duke of Altern.""See here, you can't talk to me that way, ye know!""Bah Jove, I'm offering to make you a duchess--and I love you, too,
though you may not think it!""Of course you love me, Reginald," said Carmen in gentle reply, now
relinquishing her spirit of badinage; "and I love you.But I do not
wish to marry you."The young man started under the shock and stared at her in utter lack
of comprehension.Was it possible that this unknown girl was refusing
him, a duke?"A--a--I don't get you, Miss Carmen," he stammered."Come," she said, rising and holding out a hand."Let's not talk about
this any more.I do love you, Reginald,
but not in the way that perhaps you would like.I love the real _you_;
not the vain, foolish, self-adoring human concept, called the Duke of
Altern.And the love I feel for you will help you, oh, far more than
if I married you!"I--I expected we'd be engaged--I told mother--"

"Very well, Reginald, we are engaged.Engaged in handling this little
problem that has presented itself to you.And I will help
you to solve it in the right way.Reginald dear, I
didn't mean to treat your proposal so lightly.We're just awfully good friends, aren't we?And I do
love you, more than you think."Leaving the bewildered youth in the hall, Carmen fell afoul of the
very conservative Mrs.Gannette, whose husband, suffering from a sense
of nausea since the appearance of Ames as a King Vulture, had some
moments before summoned his car and driven to his favorite club to
flood his apprehensions with Scotch high-balls.Gannette, shaking a finger at
Carmen."I saw you with Reginald just now.Tell me, dear, when shall we be able to call you the Duchess
of Altern?Carmen's spirits sank, as, without reply, she submitted to the banal
boredom of this blustering dame's society gabble.Gannette hooked
her arm into the girl's and led her to a divan."It's a great affair,
isn't it?"she panted, settling her round, unshapely form out over the
seat.Thought that was better adapted to my shape.But when
I got the cloth form around me, do you know, I couldn't get through
the door!And my unlovely pig of a husband said if I came looking like
that he'd get a divorce."The corpulent dame shook and wheezed with
the expression of her abundant merriment."Well," she continued, "it wasn't his threat that hindered me,
goodness knows!A divorce would be a relief, after living forty years
with him!Speaking of divorce,
he's just got one.Billy Patterson
dared him to exchange wives with him one evening when they were having
a little too much gaiety at the Worley home, and the doctor took the
dare.Kate Worley gets an alimony of
fifty thousand per.Why, he has a
practice of not less than two hundred and fifty thousand a year!""I supposed," murmured Carmen, "that amount of money is a measure of
his ability, a proof of his great usefulness.""He's simply in with the
wealthy, that's all.Carmen glanced at the pale, slender woman across the hall, seated
alone, and wearing a look of utter weariness."I'd like to meet her," she said, suddenly drawn by the woman's mute
appeal for sympathy."She's going to be
dropped.Hawley-Crowles was thinking of to invite her to-night!Her estate is
being handled by Ames and Company, and J. Wilton says there won't be
much left when it's settled--

"My goodness!"she exclaimed, abruptly flitting to another topic.Look at her skirt--flounced at the knees, and
full in the back so's to give a bustle effect.I wish I could wear
togs cut that way--

"They say, my dear," the garrulous old worldling prattled on, "that
next season's styles will be very ultra.Hats
small and round, like the heads of butterflies.Waists and jackets
very full and quite loose in the back and shoulders, so's to give the
appearance of wings.Belts, but no drawing in at the waist.Skirts
plaited, plaits opening wide at the knees and coming close together
again at the ankle, so's to look like the body of a butterfly.Then
butterfly bows sprinkled all over.""Oh dear," she
lamented, "I'd give anything if I had a decent shape!I'd like to wear
those shimmering, flowing, transparent summer things over silk tights.I'd look like a potato busted wide open.Now you can
wear those X-ray dresses all right--

"Say, Kathleen Ames has a new French gown to wear to the Dog Show.Skirt slit clear to the knee, with diamond garter around the leg just
below.Carmen heard little of this vapid talk, as she sat studying the pale
woman across the hall.She had resolved to meet her just as soon as
the loquacious Mrs.But that
genial old gossip gave no present evidence of a desire to change."I'm _so_ glad you're going to marry young Altern," she said, again
swerving the course of her conversation."He's got a fine old ruined
castle somewhere in England, and seems to have wads of money, though I
hear that everything is mortgaged to Ames.Still, his bare title is worth something to an American girl.And you'll do a lot for his family.You know--but
don't breathe a word of this!--his mother never was recognized
socially in England, and she finally had to give up the fight.For a
while Ames backed her, but it wouldn't do.His millions couldn't buy
her the court entree, and she just had to quit.That's why she's over
here now.The old Duke--he was lots older than she--died a couple of
years ago.Ran through everything and drank himself to death.Before
and since that happy event the Duchess did everything under the
heavens to get a bid to court.She gave millions to charity and to
entertainments.You're
a princess, royal Inca, and such like.So you see what you're expected to do for the Altern crowd--

"Dear!catching her breath and switching quickly to another
theme, "have you heard about the Hairton scandal?You see, young Sidney Ames--"

Carmen's patience had touched its limit.she
begged, holding out a hand.Gannette raised her lorgnette and looked at the girl.The scandal's about Ames's son, you know.The
reason he doesn't go in society.You see--"

"My dear Mrs.Gannette," Carmen looked up at her with a beseeching
smile."You wouldn't deliberately give me poison to drink, would
you?"blustered that garrulous lady in astonishment."Then why do you poison my mind with such conversation?""You sit there pouring into my mentality thought after thought that is
deadly poisonous, don't you know it?""You don't mean to harm me, I know," pleaded the girl."But if you
only understood mental laws you would know that every thought entering
one's mind tends to become manifested in some way.Thoughts of
disease, disaster, death, scandal--all tend to become externalized in
discordant ways, either on the body, or in the environment.You don't
want any such things manifested to me, do you?But you might just as
well hand me poison to drink as to sit there and pour such deadly
conversation into me."Gannette slowly drew herself up with the hauteur of a grandee."I do not want to listen to these unreal
things which concern only the human mind," she said earnestly."Nor
should you, if you are truly aristocratic, for aristocracy is of the
thought.I am not going to marry Reginald.But one's thought--that alone is one's claim to _real_
aristocracy.I know I have offended you, but only because I refuse to
let you poison me.She left the divan and the petrified dame, and hurriedly mingled with
the crowd on the floor.Gannette, when she again found
herself.Carmen went directly to the pale woman, still sitting alone, who had
been one of the objects of Mrs.The
woman glanced up as she saw the girl approaching, and a look of wonder
came into her eyes."I am Carmen Ariza," she said simply.The woman roused up and tried to appear composed."Will you ride with me to-morrow?""Then we can talk
all we want to, with nobody to overhear.she
abruptly added, unable longer to withstand the appeal which issued
mutely from the lusterless eyes before her."I am poverty-stricken," returned the woman sadly."But I will give you money," Carmen quickly replied."My dear child," said the woman, "I haven't anything but money.That
is why I am poverty-stricken."the girl exclaimed, sinking into a chair at her side."Well,"
she added, brightening, "now you have me!And will you call me up,
first thing in the morning, and arrange to ride with me?"Yes," she murmured, "I will--gladly."In the small hours of the morning there were several heads tossing in
stubborn wakefulness on their pillows in various New York mansions.CHAPTER 17


On the morning following Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's very successful
imitation of the _Bal de l'Opera_, Monsignor Lafelle paid an early
call to the Ames _sanctum_.And the latter gentleman deemed the visit
of sufficient importance to devote a full hour to his caller.When the
churchman rose to take his leave he reiterated:

"Our friend Wenceslas will undertake the matter for you, Mr.Ames, but
on the conditions which I have named.But Rome must be communicated
with, and the substance of her replies must be sent from Cartagena to
you, and your letters forwarded to her.That might take us into early
summer.Ketchim's engineers will
make any further attempt before that time to enter Colombia.Harris is in Denver, at his old home, you
tell me.So we need look for no immediate move from them.""Quite satisfactory, Lafelle," returned Ames genially."In future, if
I can be of service to you, I am yours to command.Willett will
hand you a check covering your traveling expenses on my behalf."When the door closed after Lafelle, Ames leaned back in his chair and
gave himself up to a moment's reflection."I wonder," he mused, "I
wonder if the fellow has something up his sleeve that he didn't show
me?I'm going to drop him after this trap is
sprung.He's got Jim Crowles's widow all tied up, too.if he begins work on that girl I'll--"

He was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone bell.shouted Ames, "you say the girl insulted your
wife last evening?I don't believe she could--Yes, yes, I mean, I
don't think she meant to--certainly not, no aspersion whatever
intended--What?the girl will have to apologize?--Well!well--No,
not in a thousand years!--Yes, I'll back her!And if your society
isn't good enough for her--and I don't think it is--why, I'll form
a little coterie all by myself!""I want a dozen brokers watching Gannette now until I call them off,"
he commanded."I want you to take personal charge of them."Lucile
already has Gannette pretty well wound up in his Venezuelan
speculations--and they are going to smash--Lafelle has fixed that.And
I've bought her notes against Mrs.Hawley-Crowles for about a
million--which I have reinvested for her in Colombia.She'll
feed out of my hand now!La Libertad is mine when the trap falls.So
is C. and R. And that little upstart, Ketchim, goes to Sing Sing!"He turned to the morning paper that lay upon his desk."I don't like
the way the Colombian revolution drags," he mused."But certainly it
can't last much longer.And then--then--"

His thoughts wandered off into devious channels."So Jose de Rincon
is--well!But--where on earth did
that girl come from?There's a lot of experience coming to
her.And then she'll drop a few of her pious notions.Lucile says--but
Lucile is getting on my nerves!"*       *       *       *       *

Monsignor Lafelle found Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward awaiting him
when his car drove up at two that afternoon.Carmen had not left the
house during the morning, for Elizabeth Wall had telephoned early that
a slight indisposition would necessitate postponement of the
contemplated ride."Well," reflected Carmen, as she turned from the 'phone, "one who
knows that God is everywhere can never be disappointed, for all good
is ever present."And then she set about preparing for the expected
call of Monsignor Lafelle.When that dignitary entered the parlor Mrs.Hawley-Crowles graciously
welcomed him, and then excused herself."I will leave her with you,
Monsignor," she said, indicating Carmen, and secretly glad to escape a
presence which she greatly feared.Lafelle bowed, and then waved
Carmen to a seat."I have come to-day, Miss Carmen," he began easily, "on a mission of
vastest importance as concerning your welfare.I have talked with the acting-Bishop there, who, it seems,
is not wholly unacquainted with you.""Then," cried Carmen eagerly, "you know where Padre Jose is?And the
others--"

"No," replied Lafelle."I regret to say I know nothing of their
present whereabouts."I have long since done that," said Carmen softly."It is of yourself that I wish to speak," continued Lafelle."I have
come to offer you the consolation, the joy, and the protection of the
Church.Hawley-Crowles, has found peace
with us.Will you longer delay taking a step toward which you are by
race, by national custom, and by your Saviour admonished?I have come
to invite you to publicly confess your allegiance to the Church of
Rome.Hawley-Crowles, is one
of us.And you, my
daughter, now need the Church," he added with suggestive emphasis.Hawley-Crowles had hinted the probable
mission of the churchman, and the girl was prepared."I thank you, Monsignor," she replied simply."My child, it is quite
necessary!""But I have my salvation, ever present."My dear child, do not lean upon your pretty theories in the hope that
they will open the door of heaven for you.There is no salvation
outside of the Church.""Monsignor," said Carmen gently, "such talk is very foolish.Can you
prove to me that your Church ever sent any one to heaven?Have you any
but a very mediaeval and material concept of heaven?It is the consciousness of good only, without a trace of
materiality or evil.And I enter into that consciousness by means of
the Christ-principle, which Jesus gave to the world.It is very
simple, is it not?And it makes all your pomp and ceremony, and your
penance and rites quite unnecessary."He had certain suspicions, but he was not
ready to voice them.Carmen went on:

"Monsignor, I love my fellow-men, oh, _so_ much!I want to see every
one work out his salvation, as Jesus bade us all do, and without any
hindrance from others.And I ask but that same privilege from every
one, yourself included.Let me work out my salvation as my Father has
directed.""I have no wish to hinder you, child.On
the contrary, I offer you the assistance and infallible guidance of
the Church.Beginning nineteen
centuries ago, when we were divinely appointed custodian of the
world's morals, our history has been a glorious one.We have in that
time changed a pagan world into one that fears God and follows His
Christ.""But for nineteen hundred years, Monsignor, the various so-called
Christian sects of the world have been persecuting and slaying one
another over their foolish beliefs, basing their religious theories
upon their interpretations of the Bible.Surely that is not a glorious
history!"You unwittingly argue directly for our cause, my child.The
result which you have just cited proves conclusively that the
Scriptures can not be correctly interpreted by every one.That is
perfectly patent to you, I see.Thus you acknowledge the necessity of
an infallible guide.That is to be found only in the spiritual
Fathers, and in the Pope, the holy Head of the Church of Rome, the
present Vicegerent of Christ on earth.""Then your interpretation of the Bible is the only correct one?""And you Catholics are the only true followers of Christ?"Come, Monsignor, I will get my coat and hat.he asked in amazement, as he slowly got to
his feet."Jesus said: 'He that believeth on
me, the works that I do shall he do also.'I am going to take you over
to the home of old Maggie, our cook's mother.You will
heal her, for you are a true follower of Christ.""Well--but, hasn't she a doctor?""Yes, but he can't help her.You should be able to do the works
which he did.You can change the wafer and wine into the flesh and
blood of Jesus.How much easier, then, and vastly more practical, to
cure a sick woman!Wait, I will be back in a minute.""But, you impetuous child, I shall go on no such foolish errand as
that!""If the woman were dying or dead, and you were
summoned, you would go, would you not?"And if she were dying you would put holy oil on her, and pray--but it
wouldn't make her well.And if she were dead, you would say Masses for
the repose of her soul.Monsignor, did it never occur to you that the
great works which you claim to do are all done behind the veil of
death?You can do but little for mankind here; but you pretend to do
much after they have passed beyond the grave.Is it quite fair to the
poor and ignorant, I ask, to work that way?Did it never strike you as
remarkable and very consistent that Jesus, whenever he launched a
great truth, immediately ratified it by some great sign, some sign
which the world now calls a miracle?The Gospels are full of such
instances, where he first taught, then came down and immediately
healed some one, thus at once putting his teaching to the proof.Your Church has taught and thundered and denounced
for ages, but what has it proved?You teach the so-called practical Christianity which makes a reality
of evil and an eternal necessity of hospitals and orphan asylums.If
you did his works the people would be so uplifted that these things
would be wiped out.Your Church has had nineteen hundred years in
which to learn to do the works which he did.Now come over to Maggie's
with me and prove that you are a true follower and believer, and that
the Church has given you the right sort of practical instruction!"Gradually the girl's voice waxed stronger while she delivered this
polemic.Slowly the churchman's face darkened, as he moved backward
and sank into his chair."Now, Monsignor, having scolded you well," the girl continued, smiling
as she sat down again, "I will apologize.But you needed the
scolding--you know you did!And nearly all who profess the name of
Christ need the same.Monsignor, I love you all, and every one,
whether Catholic or Protestant, or whatever his creed.But that does
not blind my eyes to your great need, and to your obstinate refusal to
make any effort to meet that need."A cynical look came into the man's face."May I ask, Miss Carmen, if
you consider yourself a true follower and believer?""Monsignor," she quickly replied, rising and facing him, "you hope by
that adroit question to confound me.Listen: when I was a child my purity of thought was such that I knew
no evil.I could not see sickness or
death as anything more than unreal shadows.And that wonderful
clearness of vision and purity of thought made me a channel for the
operation of the Christ-principle, God himself.And thereby the sick
were healed in my little home town.Then, little by little, after my
beloved teacher, Jose, came to me, I lost ground in my struggle to
keep the vision clear.They did not mean to, but he and my dearest
padre Rosendo and others held their beliefs of evil as a reality so
constantly before me that the vision became obscured, and the
spirituality alloyed.The unreal forces of evil seemed to concentrate
upon me.I know why now, for the greatest good always stirs up the
greatest amount of evil--the highest truth always has the lowest lie
as its opposite and opponent.I see now, as never before, the
unreality of evil.I see now, as never before, the marvelous truth
which Jesus tried, oh, _so_ hard, to impress upon the dull minds of
his people, the truth which you refuse to see.And ceaselessly I am
now striving to acquire 'that mind,' that spiritual consciousness,
which was in him.I have been
wonderfully shielded, led, and cared for.And I shall heal, some day,
as he did.I shall regain my former spirituality, for it has never
really been lost.But, Monsignor, do not ask me to come into your
Church and allow my brightening vision to become blurred by your very
inadequate concept of God--a God who is moved by the petitions of
Saints and Virgin and mortal men.Unless," she added,
brightening, "you will let me teach your Church what I know."You see," she
said, "your Church requires absolute submission to its age-worn
authority.According to you, I have nothing to give.Very well, if
your Church can receive nothing from me, and yet can give me nothing
more than its impossible beliefs, undemonstrable this side of the
grave, at least--then we must consider that a gulf is fixed between
us."Oh, Monsignor," she pleaded, after a moment's silence, "you see, do
you not?When Jesus said that he gave his disciples power over all
evil, did he not mean likewise over all physical action, and over
every physical condition?But did he mean that they alone should have
such power?No, he meant that every
one who followed him and strove ceaselessly for spirituality of
thought should acquire that spirituality, and thereby cleanse himself
of false beliefs, and make room for the Christ-principle to operate,
even to the healing of the sick, to the raising of those mesmerized by
the belief of death as a power and reality, and to the dematerializing
of the whole material concept of the heavens and earth.Can't you, a
churchman, see it?And can't you see how shallow your views are?Don't
you know that even the physical body is but a part of the human,
material concept, and therefore a part of the 'one lie' about God, who
is Spirit?"But now his time had come to speak in
rebuttal.And yet, he would make no attempt to assail her convictions.He knew well that she would not yield--at least, to-day."Miss Carmen," he said gently, "the Church is ever doing beneficent
deeds which do not come to light, and for which she receives no praise
from men.Hawley-Crowles's elevation to social
leadership came through her.There is also a rumor that the Church
afforded you an asylum on your first night in this city, when, if
ever, you needed aid.The Church shielded and cared for you even in
Simiti.Indeed, what has she not done for you?"Monsignor," replied Carmen, "I am not unmindful of the care always
bestowed upon me.But my gratitude is to my
God, who has worked through many channels to bless me.Leave it there, and fear not that I shall prove ungrateful
to Him, to whom my every thought is consecrated."Then he spoke low and earnestly, while he held
his gaze fixed upon the girl's bright eyes."Miss Carmen, if you knew
that the Church now afforded you the only refuge from the dangers that
threaten, you would turn to her as a frightened child to its mother.""I fear nothing, Monsignor," replied the girl, her face alight with a
smile of complete confidence."I am not the kind who may be driven by
fear into acceptance of undemonstrable, unfounded theological beliefs.Fear has always been a terrible weapon in the hands of those who have
sought to force their opinions upon their fellow-men.But it is
powerless to influence me.Indeed, according to the Bible
allegory, it began in the very garden of Eden, when poor, deceived
Adam confessed to God that he was afraid.If God was infinite then, as
you admit you believe Him to be now, who or what made Adam afraid?For, 'God hath not given us
the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.'"But, surely, Miss Carmen, you will not stubbornly close your eyes to
threatening evil?""Monsignor, I close my eyes to all that is unlike God.I know nothing but Him and His perfect manifestation."The picture which he and the
young girl formed was one of rare beauty and interest: he, weighted
with years, white of hair, but rugged of form, with strikingly
handsome features and kindly eyes--she, a child, delicate, almost
wraith-like, glowing with a beauty that was not of earth, and, though
untutored in the wiles of men, still holding at bay the sagacious
representative of a crushing weight of authority which reached far
back through the centuries, even to the Greek and Latin Fathers who
put their still unbroken seal upon the strange elaborations which they
wove out of the simple words of the Nazarene.When the churchman again looked up and felt himself engulfed in the
boundless love which emanated from that radiant, smiling girl, there
surged up within him a mighty impulse to go to her, to clasp her in
his arms, to fall at her feet and pray for even a mite of her own rare
spirituality.The purpose which he had that morning formulated died
within him; the final card which he would have thrown lay crushed in
his hand."The people believe you a child of the ancient Incas," he said slowly,
taking her hand."What if I should say that I know better?""I would say that you were right, Monsignor," she replied gently,
looking up into his face with a sweet smile."Then you admit the identity of your father?"The man bent for a moment over the little white hand, and then
immediately left the house.CHAPTER 18

Monsignor Lafelle in his interview with Carmen had thrown out a hint
of certain rumors regarding her; but the days passed, and the girl
awoke not to their significance.Then, one morning, her attention was
attracted by a newspaper report of the farewell address of a young
priest about to leave his flock.When she opened the paper and caught
sight of the news item she gave a little cry, and immediately forgot
all else in her absorption in the closing words:

  "--and I have known no other ambition since the day that little
  waif from a distant land strayed into my life, lighting the dead
  lamp of my faith with the torch of her own flaming spirituality.She said she had a message for the people up here.Would to God
  she might know that her message had borne fruit!"The newspaper slipped from the girl's hands to the floor.Her eyes,
big and shining, stared straight before her."And I will lead the
blind by a way that they know not--" she murmured.It was Miss Wall, ready now for the postponed
ride.Carmen clapped her hands and sang for joy as she summoned the
car and made her preparations."We'll go over to his church," she said
aloud.She hurried back to the newspaper to get the
address of the church from which he had spoken the preceding day."They will know where he is," she said happily."Oh, isn't it just
wonderful!"A few minutes later, with Miss Wall at her side, she was speeding to
the distant suburb where the little church was located."We are going to find a priest," she said simply."Oh, you mustn't ask
me any questions!Hawley-Crowles doesn't like to have me talk
about certain things, and so I can't tell you."But the happy, smiling countenance
disarmed suspicion."Now tell me," Carmen went on, "tell me about yourself.I'm a
missionary, you know," she added, thinking of Father Waite.Well, are you trying to convert the society world?""Yes, by Christianity--not by what the missionaries are now teaching
in the name of Christianity.I'll tell you all about it some day.Now
tell me, why are you unhappy?Why is your life pitched in such a minor
key?Perhaps, together, we can change it to a major."Miss Wall could not help joining in the merry laugh."I am unhappy," she said, "because I have arrived
nowhere."Carmen looked at her inquiringly."Well," she said, "that shows you
are on the wrong track, doesn't it?""I'm tired of life--tired of everything, everybody!"Miss Wall sank
back into the cushions with her lips pursed and her brow wrinkled."No, you are not tired of life," said Carmen quietly; "for you do not
know what life is.""No, I suppose not," replied the weary woman."Oh, don't mention that name, nor quote Scripture to me!"cried the
woman, throwing up her hands in exasperation."I've had that stuff
preached at me until it turned my stomach!I hope you are not an
emotional, weepy religionist."Padre Jose used to say--"

"Who's he?"demanded Miss Wall, somewhat curtly."Oh, he is a priest--"

"A priest!do you constantly associate with priests, and talk
religion?""Well," she responded, "I've had a good deal
to do with both.""Tell me something about your
life," she said."Surely I am a princess," returned Carmen, laughing merrily."Listen;
I will tell you about big, glorious Simiti, and the wonderful castle I
lived in there, and about my Prime Minister, Don Rosendo, and--well,
listen, and then judge for yourself if I am not of royal extraction!"Laughing again up into the mystified face of Miss Wall, the
enthusiastic girl began to tell about her former life in far-off
Guamoco.As she listened, the woman's eyes grew wide with interest.At times
she voiced her astonishment in sudden exclamations.And when the girl
concluded her brief recital, she bent upon the sparkling face a look
of mingled wonder and admiration.After going through all
that, how can you be so happy now?And with all your kin down there in
that awful war!"Don't you think I am a princess now?"Carmen asked, smiling up at
her."And--you don't want to know what it was that kept me through it all,
and that is still guiding me?"The bright, animated face looked so
eagerly, so lovingly, into the world-scarred features of her
companion."Not if you are going to talk religion.Tell me, who is this priest
you are seeking to-day, and why have you come to see him?"He is the one who found me--when I got lost--and took
me to my friends."The big car whirled around a corner and stopped before a dingy little
church edifice surmounted by a weather-beaten cross.On the steps of a
modest frame house adjoining stood a man.Carmen threw wide the door of the car and sprang out.A light came into the startled man's eyes.Then he
stepped back, that he might better see her.More than a year had
passed since he had taken her, so oddly garbed, and clinging tightly
to his hand, into the Ketchim office.And in that time, he thought,
she had been transformed into a vision of heavenly beauty.And
with that she threw her arms about him and kissed him loudly on both
cheeks.The man and Miss Wall gave vent to exclamations of astonishment.He
 violently; Miss Wall sat with mouth agape.pursued the girl, again grasping his
hands."An angel from heaven could not be more
welcome," he said.But his voice was low, and the note of sadness was
prominent."Well, I am an angel from heaven," said the laughing, artless girl.But,
whoever I am, I am, oh, so glad to see you again!I--" she looked
about carefully--"I read your sermon in the newspaper this morning."Yes, I meant you," he softly answered."Come with me now," said the eager girl."Impossible," he replied, shaking his head."Then, will you come and see me?""Why have
you never been to see me?Didn't you know I was still in the city?""I used to see your name in the papers, often.And I have followed your career with great interest.But--you moved in
a circle--from which I--well, it was hardly possible for me to come to
see you, you know--"

"It was!""But, never mind, you are coming now.Here," drawing a card from her bag, "this is the address of Madam
Beaubien.Will you come there to-morrow afternoon, at two, and talk
with me?"He looked at the card which she thrust into his hand, and then at the
richly-gowned girl before him.But he
nodded his head slowly."Tell me," she whispered, "how is Sister Katie?"Ah, if the girl could have known how that great-hearted old soul had
mourned her "little bairn" these many months."I will go to see her," said Carmen."But first you will come to me
to-morrow."She beamed upon him as she clasped his hands again.Then
she entered the car, and sat waving her hand back at him as long as he
could see her.It would be difficult to say which of the two, Miss Wall or Father
Waite, was the more startled by this abrupt and lively _rencontre_.But to Carmen, as she sat back in the car absorbed in thought, it had
been a perfectly natural meeting between two warm friends."You haven't anything but money, and
fine clothes, and automobiles, and jewels, you think.asked the wondering woman, marveling at this strange
girl who went about embracing people so promiscuously.The woman's lip trembled slightly when she heard this, but she did not
reply."And I'm going to love you," the girl continued.You're
tired of society gabble and gossip; you're tired of spending on
yourself the money you never earned; you're not a bit of use to
anybody, are you?You're a sort of tragedy, aren't
you?There are just lots of them in high society, just as
weary as you.And they lack the very
greatest thing in all of life, the very thing that no amount of money
will buy, just love!they don't realize that, in
order to get, they must give.In order to be loved, they must
themselves love.Now you start right in and love the whole world, love
everybody, big and little.And, as you love people, try to see only
their perfection.Never look at a bad trait, nor a blemish of any
sort.In a week's time you will be a new woman.""I have _always_ done it," replied Carmen."I don't know anything but
love.I never knew what it was to hate or revile.I never could see
what there was that deserved hatred or loathing.I don't see anything
but good--everywhere.""I--I don't mind your talking
that way to me," she whispered."But I just couldn't bear to listen to
any more religion."Love is the
tie that binds all together and all to God.Why, Miss Wall--"

"Call me Elizabeth, please," interrupted the woman."Well then, Elizabeth," she said softly, "all creeds have got to merge
into just one, some day, and, instead of saying 'I believe,' everybody
will say 'I understand and I love.'Why, the very person who loved
more than anybody else ever did was the one who saw God most clearly!He knew that if we would see God--good everywhere--we would just
simply _have_ to love, for God _is_ love!"Do you love me, Carmen, because you pity me?""God's children are not to be
pitied--and I see in people only His children.""Well, why, then, do you love me?"The girl replied quickly: "God is love."And now," she continued cheerily, "we are going to work together,
aren't we?And then you are
going to see just what is right for you to do--what work you are to
take up--what interests you are to have."Tell me, Carmen, why are you in society?What keeps you there, in an
atmosphere so unsuited to your spiritual life?""But--"

"Well, Elizabeth dear, every step I take is ordained by Him, who is my
life.I leave everything to Him, and then
keep myself out of the way.If He wishes to use me elsewhere, He will
remove me from society.How could this girl, who, in her
few brief years, had passed through fire and flood, still love the
hand that guided her!CHAPTER 19


To the great horde of starving European nobility the daughters of
American millionaires have dropped as heavenly manna.It was but dire
necessity that forced low the bars of social caste to the transoceanic
traffic between fortune and title.Hawley-Crowles might ever aspire to the purchase of a
decrepit dukedom had never entered her thought.A tottering earldom
was likewise beyond her purchasing power.She had contented herself
that Carmen should some day barter her rare culture, her charm, and
her unrivaled beauty, for the more lowly title of an impecunious count
or baron.But to what heights of ecstasy did her little soul rise when
the young Duke of Altern made it known to her that he would honor her
beautiful ward with his own glorious name--in exchange for La Libertad
and other good and valuable considerations, receipt of which would be
duly acknowledged."I--aw--have spoken to her, ye know, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," that worthy
young cad announced one afternoon, as he sat alone with the successful
society leader in the warm glow of her living room.she said we were engaged, ye know--really!Said we were awfully good
friends, ye know, and all that.For Reginald had done much thinking of late--and his creditors were
restless.Hawley-Crowles,
beaming like a full-blown sunflower.Only--ye know, she'll have to be--coached a bit, ye
know--told who we are--our ancestral history, and all that.Why, she just couldn't help loving you!""No--aw--no, of course--that is--aw--she has excellent
prospects--financial, I mean, eh?Mines, and all that, ye know--eh?""Why, she owns the grandest gold mine in all South America!I--aw--I never was so attracted to a girl in all me
blooming life!You will--a--speak to her, eh?"Never fear, Reginald" she's yours.Certainly not--not when she knows about our family.And--aw--mother will talk with you--that is, about the details.She'll
arrange them, ye know.And the haughty mother of the young Duke did call shortly thereafter
to consult in regard to her son's matrimonial desires.The nerve-racking
round of balls, receptions, and other society functions was quite
forgotten by the elated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose ears tingled
deliciously under the pompous boastings of the Dowager Lady Altern.Hawley-Crowles was convinced, after a
half hour's conversation with this proud mother, that the royal house
of Brunswick was but an impudent counterfeit!Reed, who had
hastily appraised it, had said that there was a mountain of gold there,
only awaiting Yankee enterprise.There was proof positive
that she was an Inca princess.Hawley-Crowles was so honored
by the deep interest which the young Duke manifested in the wonderful
girl!And she would undertake negotiations with her at once.Hawley-Crowles had to plan very carefully.She was terribly
in debt; yet she had resources.The Beaubien was inexhaustible.Ames,
too, might be depended upon.And La Libertad--well, there was Mr.Philip O. Ketchim to reckon with.So she forthwith summoned him to a
consultation.But, ere her talk with that prince of finance, another bit of good
fortune fell into the lady's spacious lap.Reed had written that he
was doing poorly with his western mining ventures, and would have to
raise money at once.He therefore offered to sell his interest in the
Simiti Company.Moreover, he wanted his wife to come to him and make
her home in California, where he doubtless would spend some years.Hawley-Crowles offered him twenty-five thousand dollars for his
Simiti interest; of which offer Reed wired his immediate acceptance.Then the lady packed her rueful sister Westward Ho!and laid her newly
acquired stock before the Beaubien for a large loan.That was but a
day before Ketchim called."Madam," said that suave gentleman, smiling piously, "you are a
genius.Our ability to announce the Duke of Altern as our largest
stockholder will result in a boom in the sales of Simiti stock.The
Lord has greatly prospered our humble endeavors.Er--might I ask,
Madam, if you would condescend to meet my wife some afternoon?We are
rapidly acquiring some standing in a financial way, and Mrs.Ketchim
would like to know you and some of the more desirable members of your
set, if it might be arranged."Hawley-Crowles beamed her joy.She drew herself up with a regnant
air.The people were coming to her, their social queen, for
recognition!"And there's my Uncle Ted, you know, Madam.He's president of the C.
and R."Hawley-Crowles nodded and looked wise."Possibly we can arrange
it," she said.What is Joplin
Zinc doing?"The lady wondered, for Joplin Zinc was not yet in operation, according
to the latest report.*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, while Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was still laying her plans to herd
the young girl into the mortgaged dukedom of Altern, Father Waite kept
his appointment, and called at the Beaubien mansion on the afternoon
Carmen had set.He was warmly received by the girl herself, who had
been watching for his coming."Now," she began like a bubbling fountain, when they were seated in
the music room, "where's Jude?Why, I haven't the slightest idea to whom you refer," returned
the puzzled man."The woman who took me to the Sister Superior," explained Carmen."Well," said the girl confidently, "I saw her, but she got away from
me.But I shall find her--it is right that I should.Now tell me, what
are you going to do?"Earn my living some way," he replied meditatively."You have lots of friends who will help you?""I am an apostate, you know.""Well, that means that you're free.The chains have dropped, haven't
they?""You are not dazed, nor confused!Why, you're like a prisoner coming
out of his dungeon into the bright sunlight.You're only blinking,
that's all.And, as for confusion--well, if I would admit it to be
true I could point to a terrible state of it!Just think, a duke wants
to marry me; Mrs.Hawley-Crowles is determined that he shall; I am an
Inca princess, and yet I don't know who I am; my own people apparently
are swallowed up by the war in Colombia; and I am in an environment
here in New York in which I have to fight every moment to keep myself
from flying all to pieces!But I guess God intends to keep me here for
the present.Oh, yes, and Monsignor Lafelle insists that I am a
Catholic and that I must join his Church.""Is Monsignor Lafelle working with
Madam Beaubien, your friend?"Hawley-Crowles--"

"Was it through him that she became a communicant?"Ames's sister, the Dowager Duchess, in England.The young Duke is also
going to join the faith, I learn.He stopped suddenly and
looked searchingly at her.At that moment a maid entered, bearing a card.Close on her heels
followed the subject of their conversation, Monsignor himself.As he entered, Carmen rose hastily to greet him.Then, as he straightened up, his glance fell upon Father Waite.For a moment the two men stood
eying each other sharply.Then Lafelle looked from Father Waite to
Carmen quizzically."I beg your pardon," he said, "I was not aware
that you had a caller.Madam Beaubien, is she at home?"murmured Lafelle, looking significantly from the girl to Father
Waite, while a smile curled his lips.He bowed again, and turned toward the exit.She had caught the
churchman's insinuating glance and instantly read its meaning."Monsignor Lafelle, you will remain!"The churchman's brows arched with surprise, but he came back and stood
by the chair which she indicated."And first," went on the girl, standing before him like an incarnate
Nemesis, her face flushed and her eyes snapping, "you will hear from
me a quotation from the Scripture, on which you assume to be
authority: 'As a man thinketh in his heart, so _is_ he!'"Finally a bland
smile spread over his features, and he sat down."Now, Monsignor Lafelle," she continued severely, "you have urged me
to unite with your Church.When you asked me to subscribe to your
beliefs I looked first at them, and then at you, their product.You
have come here this afternoon to plead with me again.The thoughts
which you accepted when you saw Father Waite here alone with me, are
they a reflection of love, which thinketh no evil?Or do they reflect
the intolerance, the bigotry, the hatred of the carnal mind?You told
me that your Church would not let me teach it.Think you I will let it
or you teach me?"Father Waite sat amazed at the girl's stinging rebuke.When she
concluded he rose to go.You have left the Church
of which Monsignor Lafelle is a part.Either you have done that
Church, and him, a great injustice--or he does ignorant or wilful
wrong in insisting that I unite with it.""My dear child," said Lafelle gently, now recovered and wholly on his
guard, "your impetuosity gets the better of your judgment.This is no
occasion for a theological discussion, nor are you sufficiently
informed to bear a part in such.As for myself, you unintentionally do
me great wrong.As I have repeatedly told you, I seek only your
eternal welfare.Else would I not labor with you as I do.""Is my eternal welfare dependent upon
acceptance of the Church's doctrines?""No," he said, in a scarcely audible voice.A cynical look came into Lafelle's eyes.But he replied affably: "When
preachers fall out, the devil falls in.Waite, comes
quite consistently from one who has impudently tossed aside
authority.""My authority, Monsignor," returned the ex-priest in a low tone, "is
Jesus Christ, who said: 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.'"murmured Lafelle; "then it was love that prompted you to abandon
your little flock?""I left my pulpit, Monsignor, because I had nothing to give my people.I no longer believe the dogmas of the Church.And I refused longer to
take the poor people's money to support an institution so politically
religious as I believe your Church to be.I could no longer take their
money to purchase the release of their loved ones from an imagined
purgatory--a place for which there is not the slightest Scriptural
warrant--"

"You mistake, sir!""Very well, Monsignor," replied Father Waite; "grant, then, that there
is such Scriptural warrant; I would nevertheless know that the
existence of purgatory was wholly incompatible with the reign of an
infinite God of love.And, knowing that, I have ceased to extort gifts
of money from the ignorance of the living and the ghastly terrors of
the dying--"

"And so deceive yourself that you are doing a righteous act in
removing their greatest consolation," the churchman again interrupted,
a sneer curving his lip.The consolation which the stupifying drug affords, yes!Ah, Monsignor, as I looked down into the faces of my poor people, week
after week, I knew that no sacerdotal intervention was needed to remit
their sins, for their sins were but their unsolved problems of life.Oh, the poor, grief-stricken mothers who bent their tear-stained eyes
upon me as I preached the 'authority' of the Fathers!Well I knew
that, when I told them from my pulpit that their deceased infants, if
baptized, went straight to heaven, they blindly, madly accepted my
words!And when I went further and told them that their dead babes had
joined the ranks of the blessed, and could thenceforth be prayed to,
could I wonder that they rejoiced and eagerly grasped the false
message of cheer?They believed because they wanted it to be so.And
yet those utterances of mine, based upon the accepted doctrine of
Holy Church, were but narcotics, lulling those poor, afflicted minds
into a false sense of rest and security, and checking all further
human progress.""It is to be regretted," he said
coldly, "that such narrowness of view should be permitted to impede
the salvation of souls.""Ah, how many souls
have I not saved!--and yet I know not whether they or I be really
saved!From misery,
disease, suffering in this life?Ah, my friend, saved only from the torments of a hell and a purgatory
constructed in the fertile minds of busy theologians!""Some other day, perhaps--when it may be
more convenient for us both--and you are alone--"

Carmen laughed."Don't quit the field, Monsignor--unless you surrender
abjectly.And you were quite
indiscreet, if you will recall.""You write my faults in brass," he gently
lamented."When you publish my virtues, if you find that I am
possessed of any, I fear you will write them in water.""Your virtues should advertise themselves,
Monsignor.""Ah, then do you not see in me the virtue of desiring your welfare
above all else, my child?""And the welfare of this great country, which you have come here to
assist in making dominantly Catholic, is it not so, Monsignor?"Then he smiled genially back at the girl."It is an ambition which I am not ashamed to own," he returned
gently."But, Monsignor," Carmen continued earnestly, "are you not aware of
the inevitable failure of your mission?Do you not know that mediaeval
theology comports not with modern progress?""True, my child," replied the churchman."And more, that our
so-called modern progress--modernism, free-thinking, liberty of
conscience, and the consequent terrible extravagance of beliefs and
false creeds--constitutes the greatest menace now confronting this
fair land."Monsignor," said Carmen, "in the Middle Ages the Church was supreme.Emperors and kings bowed in submission before her.Would you be willing, for the sake of Church
supremacy to-day, to return to the state of society and civilization
then obtaining?"I point you to Mexico, Cuba, the Philippines, South America, all
Catholic now or formerly, and I ask if you attribute not their
oppression, their ignorance, their low morals and stunted manhood, to
the dominance of churchly doctrines, which oppose freedom of
conscience and press and speech, and make learning the privilege of
the clergy and the rich?""It is an old argument, child," deprecated Lafelle."May I not point
to France, on the contrary?""She has all but driven the Church from her borders.""And England, though Anglican,
calls herself Catholic.Germany is
forsaking Luther, as she sees the old light shining still undimmed."The latter read in her glance an
invitation further to voice his own convictions."Monsignor doubtless misreads the signs of the times," he said slowly."The hour has struck for the ancient and materialistic theories
enunciated with such assumption of authority by ignorant, often
blindly bigoted theologians, to be laid aside.The religion of our
fathers, which is our present-day evangelical theology, was derived
from the traditions of the early churchmen.They put their seal upon
it; and we blindly accept it as authority, despite the glaring,
irrefutable fact that it is utterly undemonstrable.Why do the people
continue to be deceived by it?only because of its mesmeric
promise of immortality beyond the grave."Monsignor bowed stiffly in the direction of Father Waite."Fortunately,
your willingness to plunge the Christian world into chaos will fail of
concrete results," he said coldly."I but voice the sentiments of millions, Monsignor.For them, too, the
time has come to put by forever the paraphernalia of images, candles,
and all the trinkets used in the pagan ceremonial which has so
quenched our spirituality, and to seek the undivided garment of the
Christ.""The world to-day, Monsignor, stands at the door of a new era, an era
which promises a grander concept of God and religion, the tie which
binds all to Him, than has ever before been known.And we are at
last beginning to work with true scientific precision and system.As
in chemistry, mathematics, and the physical sciences, so in matters
religious, we are beginning to _prove_ our working hypotheses.And so
a new spiritual enlightenment is come.People are awaking to a dim
perception of the meaning of spiritual life, as exemplified in Jesus
Christ.And they are vaguely beginning to see that it is possible to
every one.The abandonment of superstition, religious and other, has
resulted in such a sudden expansion of the human mind that the most
marvelous material progress the world has ever witnessed has come
swiftly upon us, and we live more intensely in a single hour to-day
than our fathers lived in weeks before us.Oh, yes, we are already
growing tired of materiality.But, Monsignor, let not the Church boast itself that the
acceptance of her mediaeval dogmas will meet the world's great need.That need will be met, I think, only as we more and more clearly
perceive the tremendous import of the mission of Jesus, and learn how
to grasp and apply the marvelous Christ-principle which he used and
told us we should likewise employ to work out our salvation."During Father Waite's earnest talk Lafelle sat with his eyes fixed
upon Carmen.When the ex-priest concluded, the churchman ignored him
and vouchsafed no reply.said the girl, after waiting some moments in
expectation.Then, nodding his shapely head, he said in
a pleading tone:

"Have I no champion here?Would you, too, suddenly abolish the Church,
Catholic and Protestant alike?Why, my dear child, with your
ideals--which no one appreciates more highly than I--do you continue
to persecute me so cruelly?Can not you, too, sense the unsoundness of
the views just now so eloquently voiced?"You speak wholly without authority or proof,
as is your wont.""Well," he said, "there are several hundred
million Catholics and Protestants in the world to-day.Would you
presume to say that they are all mistaken, and that you are right?Indeed, I think you set the
Church an example in that respect.""Monsignor, there were once several hundred millions who believed that
the earth was flat, and that the sun revolved about it.But the--"

"And, Monsignor, there are billions to-day who believe that matter is
a solid, substantial reality, and that it possesses life and
sensation.There are billions who believe that the physical eyes see,
and the ears hear, and the hands feel.Yet these beliefs are all
capable of scientific refutation."I am not unacquainted with philosophical speculation," he returned
suggestively."This is not mere speculation, Monsignor," put in Father Waite."The
beliefs of the human mind are its fetish.Such beliefs become in time
national customs, and men defend them with frenzy, utterly wrong and
undemonstrable though they be.Then they remain as the incubus of true
progress.By them understanding becomes degraded, and the human mind
narrows and shrinks.And the mind that clings to them will then
mercilessly hunt out the dissenting minds of its heretical neighbors
and stone them to death for disagreeing.So now, you would stone me
for obeying Christ's command to take up my bed on the Sabbath day.""Still you blazon my faults," he said in
a tone of mock sadness, and addressing Carmen."But, like the Church
which you persecute, I shall endure.We have been martyred throughout
the ages.Our wayward children forsake us,"
nodding toward Father Waite, "and yet we welcome their return when
they have tired of the husks.The press teems with slander against us;
we are reviled from east to west.But our reply is that such slander
and untruth can best be met by our leading individual lives of such an
exemplary nature as to cause all men to be attracted by our holy
light.""I agree with you, Monsignor," quickly replied Carmen."Scurrilous
attacks upon the Church but make it a martyr.Vilification returns
upon the one who hurls the abuse.One can not fling mud without
soiling one's hands.I oppose not men, but human systems of thought.Whatever is good will stand, and needs no defense.And there is no excuse, for salvation is at hand.""_Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts_,"
she replied earnestly."_To him that soweth righteousness_--right
thinking--_shall be a sure reward_.Ah, Monsignor, do you at heart
believe that the religion of the Christ depends upon doctrines, signs,
dogmas?But signs and proofs naturally and inevitably
follow the right understanding of Jesus' teachings, even according to
these words: _These signs shall follow them that believe_.Paul gave the
formula for salvation, when he said: _But we all with open face beholding
as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord_.Can you see that, taking Jesus as our model and
following his every command--seeing Him only, the Christ-principle, which
is God, good, without any admixture of evil--we change, even though
slowly, from glory to glory, step by step, until we rise out of all
sense of evil and death?And this is done by the Spirit which is God.""Yes," said Father Waite, taking up the conversation when she paused."Even the poorest human being can understand that.Why, then, the
fungus growth of traditions, ceremonies, rites and forms which have
sprung up about the Master's simple words?Why the wretched
formalistic worship throughout the world?Why the Church's frigid,
lifeless traditions, so inconsistent with the enlarging sense of God
which marks this latest century?The Church has yet to prove its
utility, its right to exist and to pose as the religious teacher of
mankind.Else must it fall beneath the axe which is even now at the
root of the barren tree of theology.Her theology, like the Judaism of
the Master's day, has no prophets, no poets, no singers.And her
priests, as in his time, have sunk into a fanatical observance of
ritual and form.""And yet," observed Carmen, "you still urge me to unite with it."Moreover, it irked him sore to be made a
target for the unassailable logic of the apostate Waite.Then, too,
the appearance of the ex-priest there that afternoon in company with
this girl who held such radical views regarding religious matters
portended in his thought the possibility of a united assault upon the
foundations of his cherished system.She
nettled and exasperated him.Did he
have the power to silence her?he asked, with a show of gaiety."Yes," replied Carmen, "you may go now."He, Monsignor, a dignitary of
Holy Church?He turned upon the girl and her
companion, furious with anger."I have been very patient with you both," he said in a voice that he
could not control.Abuse the Church
as you will, the fact remains that the world fears her and trembles
before her awful voice!Because the world recognizes her mighty
power, a power of unified millions of human beings and exhaustless
wealth.She is the leader, the guide, the teacher, the supreme object
of worship of a countless army who would lay down their lives to-day
for her.Her subjects gather from every quarter of the globe.They are
English, French, German, American--_but they are Catholics first_!Emperor, King, Ruler, or Government--all are alike subject to her
supreme, divine authority!Nationalities, customs, family ties--all
melt away before her, to whom her followers bow in loyal consecration.The power which her supreme leader and head wields is all but
omnipotent!He is by divine decree Lord of the world.Hundreds of
millions bend before his throne and offer him their hearts and swords!I say, you have good reason to quake!The onward march of Holy Church is not disturbed by the croaking
calumnies of such as you who would assault her!And to you I say,
beware!"His face was purple, as he stopped and mopped his damp brow."What we have to beware of, Monsignor," said Father Waite gravely, "is
the steady encroachments of Rome in this country, with her weapons of
fear, ignorance, and intolerance--"

"Intolerance!Why, in this country, whose
Constitution provided toleration for every form of religion--"

Carmen had risen and gone to the man."Monsignor," she said, "the
founders of the American nation did provide for religious tolerance--and
they were wise according to their light.But we of this day are
still wiser, for we have some knowledge of the wonderful working of
mental laws.I, too, believe in toleration of opinion.You are
welcome to yours, and I to mine.But--and here is the great point--the
opinion which Holy Church has held throughout the ages regarding those
who do not accept her dogmas is that they are damned, that they are
outcasts of heaven, that they merit the stake and rack.The Church's
hatred of heretics has been deadly.Her thought concerning them has
not been that of love, such as Jesus sent out to all who did not
agree with him, but deadly, suggestive hatred.Now our Constitution
does not provide for tolerance of hate and murder-thoughts, which enter
the minds of the unsuspecting and work destruction there in the form
of disease, disaster, and death.That is what we object to in you,
Monsignor.And toward such thoughts we have a right to be very intolerant, even to
the point of destroying them in human mentalities.Again I say, I war
not against people, but against the murderous carnal thought of the
human mind!"Monsignor had fallen back before the girl's strong words.His face
had grown black, and his hands were working convulsively."Monsignor," continued Carmen in a low, steady voice, "you have
threatened me with something which you apparently hold over me.You
are very like the people of Galilee: if you can not refute by reason,
you would circumvent by law, by the Constitution, by Congress.Instead of threatening us with the flames
of hell for not being good, why do you not show us by the great
example of Jesus' love how to be so?Are you manifesting love now--or
the carnal mind?I judge your Church by such as manifest it to me.How, then, shall I judge it by you to-day?"He rose slowly and took her by the hand."I beg your pardon," he said
in a strange, unnatural voice.And I assure you that you quite
misunderstand me, and the Church which I represent."Surely, Monsignor," returned the girl heartily."A debate such as
this is stimulating, don't you think so?""Ah, Monsignor," she said lightly, as she stepped into the room.Why have you avoided me since your return to America?""Madam," replied Lafelle, in some confusion, "no one regrets more than
I the press of business which necessitated it.But your little friend
has told me I may return.""Always welcome, Monsignor," replied the Beaubien, scanning him
narrowly as she accompanied him to the door."By the way, you forgot
our little compact, did you not?""Madam, I came out of a sense of duty.""Of that I have no doubt, Monsignor.She returned again to the music room, where Carmen made her acquainted
with Father Waite, and related the conversation with Lafelle.While
the girl talked the Beaubien's expression grew serious.Then Carmen
launched into her association with the ex-priest, concluding with:
"And he must have something to do, right away, to earn his living!"She always did when Carmen, no matter how
serious the conversation, infused her sparkling animation into it."That isn't nearly as important as to know what he thinks about
Monsignor's errand here this afternoon, dearie," she said."Madam," he said with great seriousness, "I would
be very wide awake."The Beaubien studied him for a moment."I think--I think--" He hesitated, and looked at Carmen."I think he--has been greatly angered by--this girl--and by my
presence here."Then abruptly: "What are you going to do
now?""I have funds enough to keep me some weeks, Madam, while making plans
for the future.""Then remain where I can keep in touch with you."For the Beaubien had just returned from a two hours' ride with J.
Wilton Ames, and she felt that she needed a friend.CHAPTER 20


The Beaubien sat in the rounded window of the breakfast room.Carmen
nestled at her feet.The maid had just removed the remains of the
light luncheon."Dearest, please, _please_ don't look so serious!"The Beaubien twined her fingers through the girl's flowing locks."I
will try, girlie," she said, though her voice broke.Carmen looked up into her face with a wistful yearning."Ever since Monsignor Lafelle and Father Waite
were here you have been so quiet; and that was nearly a week ago.I
know I can help, if you will only let me.""By knowing that God is everywhere, and that evil is unreal and
powerless," came the quick, invariable reply.Why, if I were chained to a stake, with fire all around me, I'd
know it wasn't true!""I think you are chained--and the fire has been kindled," said the
woman in a voice that fell to a whisper."Then your thought is wrong--all wrong!And wrong thought just _can't_
be externalized to me, for I know that 'There shall no mischief happen
to the righteous,' that is, to the right-thinking.The Beaubien got up and walked slowly around
the room, as if to summon her strength."I'm going to tell you," she said firmly."You are right, and I have
been wrong.I--I
have lost a great deal of money."I have discovered in the past few months that there are better
things in life.But--" her lips tightened, and her eyes half
closed--"he can _not_ have you!"Listen, child: I know not why it is, but you awaken something in
every life into which you come.The woman I was a year ago and the
woman I am to-day meet almost as strangers now.The only answer I
can give is, you.I don't know what you did to people in South
America; I can only surmise.Yet of this I am certain, wherever you
went you made a path of light.But the effect you have on people
differs with differing natures.Just why this is, I do not know.It
must have something to do with those mental laws of which I am so
ignorant, and of which you know so much."Carmen looked at her in wondering anticipation.The Beaubien smiled
down into the face upturned so lovingly, and went on:

"From what you have told me about your priest, Jose, I know that you
were the light of his life.He loved you to the complete obliteration
of every other interest.You have not said so; but I know it.How,
indeed, could it be otherwise?On the other hand, that heartless
Diego--his mad desire to get possession of you was only animal.Why
should you, a child of heaven, arouse such opposite sentiments?""Dearest," said the girl, laying her head on the woman's knees, "that
isn't what's worrying you.""No--but I think of it so often.And, as for me, you have turned me
inside-out.""Well, I think this side wears better,
don't you?""It is softer--it may not," returned the woman gently."But I have no
desire to change back."Ames
and I have been--no, not friends.I had no higher ideals than he, and
I played his game with him.And at a time when he had
involved me heavily financially.The Colombian revolution--his cotton
deal--he must have foreseen, he is so uncanny--he must have known that
to involve me meant control whenever he might need me!He needs me
now, for I stand between him and you.""God stands between me and every
form of evil!"She sat down on the arm of the Beaubien's chair."Is it
because you will not let him have me that he threatens to ruin you
financially?"He couldn't ruin me in reputation, for--" her voice again faded
to a whisper, "I haven't any."cried the girl, throwing her arms about the
woman's neck."Your true self is just coming to light!The Beaubien suddenly burst into a flood of tears.The strain of weeks
was at last manifesting."Oh, I have been in the gutter!--he dragged
me through the mire!--and I let him!I schemed and plotted with him; I ruined and pillaged
with him; I murdered reputations and blasted lives with him, that I
might get money, dirty, blood-stained money!Oh, Carmen, I didn't know
what I was doing, until you came!And now I'd hang on the cross if I
could undo it!And he has you and me in his
clutches, and he is crushing us!"She bent her head and sobbed
violently."Be still, and _know_ that I am
God."The Beaubien raised her head and smiled feebly through her
tears."He governs all, dearest," whispered Carmen, as she drew the woman's
head to her breast.cried the Beaubien, starting up.No, we will stay and meet them, right here!"The Beaubien's hand shook as she clasped Carmen's."I can't turn to
Kane, nor to Fitch, nor Weston.I've
ruined Gannette myself--for him!Hawley-Crowles--"

"Mrs.sobbed the suffering woman, clinging to the girl."I lent her money--took her notes--which I sold again to Mr."Well, you can buy them back, can't you?"Most that I have is mortgaged to him on the investments I made at his
direction," wailed the woman."I will try--I am trying, desperately!But--there is Monsignor Lafelle!"And I'm sure he holds something over
you and me.But, I will send for him--I will renew my vows to his
Church--anything to--"

"Listen, dearest," interrupted Carmen.If I am the cause of it all, I can--"

"You will not!"The desperate woman put her head in the girl's lap and sobbed
bitterly."There is a way out, dearest," whispered Carmen."I _know_ there is,
no matter what seems to be or to happen, for 'underneath are the
everlasting arms.'Hawley-Crowles told me this
morning that Mrs.Ames intends to give a big reception next week.And--it will be right, I
know."And Carmen sat with the repentant woman all that day, struggling with
her to close the door upon her sordid past, and to open it wide to
"that which is to come."*       *       *       *       *

The days following were busy ones for many with whom our story is
concerned.Every morning saw Carmen on her way to the Beaubien, to
comfort and advise.Every afternoon found her yielding gently to the
relentless demands of society, or to the tiresome calls of her
thoroughly ardent wooer, the young Duke of Altern.Carmen would have
helped him if she could.But she found so little upon which to build.And she bore with him largely on account of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, for
whom she and the Beaubien were now daily laboring.The young man
tacitly assumed proprietorship over the girl, and all society was agog
with expectation of the public announcement of their engagement.Hawley-Crowles still came and went upon a tide of unruffled joy.The cornucopia of Fortune lay full at her feet.Her broker, Ketchim,
basked in the sunlight of her golden smiles--and quietly sold his own
Simiti stock on the strength of her patronage.Society fawned and
smirked at her approach, and envied her brilliant success, as it
copied the cut of her elaborate gowns--all but the deposed Mrs.Ames
and her unlovely daughter, who sulked and hated, until they received a
call from Monsignor Lafelle.This was shortly after that gentleman's
meeting with Carmen and Father Waite in the Beaubien mansion.And he
left the Ames home with an ominous look on his face."The girl is a
menace," he muttered, "and she deserves her fate."The Ames grand reception, promising to be the most brilliant event of
the year, barring the famous _Bal de l'Opera_, was set for Thursday.Hawley-Crowles nor Carmen had received invitations.To the former it was evident that there was some mistake."For it
can't be possible that the hussy doesn't intend to invite us!"Hawley-Crowles
drenched with tears of anxiety and vexation."I'd call her up and ask,
if I dared," she groaned.And, to the
amazement of the exclusive set, the brilliant function was held
without the presence of its acknowledged leaders, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
and her ward, the Inca princess.*       *       *       *       *

On Wednesday night Harris arrived from Denver.His arrival was
instantly made known to J. Wilton Ames, who, on the morning following,
summoned both him and Philip O. Ketchim to his private office.There
were present, also, Monsignor Lafelle and Alonzo Hood.The latter was observed to change color as he
timidly entered the room and faced the waiting audience."Be seated, gentlemen," said Ames genially, after cordially shaking
hands with them and introducing the churchman.Then, turning to
Harris, "You are on your way to Colombia, I learn.Going down to
inaugurate work on the Simiti holdings, I suppose?"Harris threw a quick glance at Ketchim.The latter sat blank,
wondering if there were any portions of the earth to which Ames's long
arms did not reach."As a matter of fact," Ames continued, leaning back in his chair and
pressing the tips of his fingers together before him, "a hitch seems
to have developed in Simiti proceedings.Ketchim," turning suddenly and sharply upon that gentleman, "because
my brokers have picked up for me several thousand shares of the
stock.""But," proceeded Ames calmly, "now that I have put money into it, I
learn that the Simiti Company has no property whatever in Colombia."A haze slowly gathered before Ketchim's eyes."How do you make that out, Mr.he
heard Harris say in a voice that seemed to come from an infinite
distance."I myself saw the title papers which old Rosendo had, and
saw them transferred to Mr.Moreover,
I personally visited the mine in question."The
property was relocated by this Rosendo, and he secured title to it
under the name of the Chicago mine.It was that name which deceived
the clerks in the Department of Mines in Cartagena, and caused them to
issue title, not knowing that it really was the famous old La
Libertad.""Well, I don't see that there is any ground for confusion.""Simply this," returned Ames evenly: "La Libertad mine, since the
death of its former owner, Don Ignacio de Rincon, has belonged to the
Church.""By what right does it belong to the
Church?""By the ancient law of _'en manos muertas'_, my friend," replied Ames,
unperturbed."Our friend, Monsignor Lafelle, representing the Church, will
explain," said Ames, waving a hand toward that gentleman."I deeply regret this unfortunate
situation, gentlemen," he began.Ames has pointed out,
the confusion came about through issuing title to the mine under the
name Chicago.Don Ignacio de Rincon, long before his departure from
Colombia after the War of Independence, drew up his last will, and,
following the established custom among wealthy South Americans of that
day, bequeathed this mine, La Libertad, and other property, to the
Church, invoking the old law of _'en manos muertas'_ which, being
translated, means, 'in dead hands.'Pious Catholics of many lands have
done the same throughout the centuries.Such a bequest places property
in the custody of the Church; and it may never be sold or disposed of
in any way, but all revenue from it must be devoted to the purchase of
Masses for the souls in purgatory.It was through the merest chance, I
assure you, that your mistake was brought to light.Ames, had purchased stock in your company, I took the
pains to investigate while in Cartagena recently, and made the
discovery which unfortunately renders your claim to the mine quite
null."turning savagely
upon the paralyzed Ketchim."That," interposed Ames with cruel significance, "is a matter which he
will explain in court."Fleeting visions of the large blocks of stock which he had sold; of
the widows, orphans, and indigent clergymen whom he had involved; of
the notes which the banks held against him; of his questionable deals
with Mrs.Hawley-Crowles; and of the promiscuous peddling of his own
holdings in the now ruined company, rushed over the clouded mind of
this young genius of high finance.His tongue froze, though his
trembling body dripped with perspiration.Somehow he found the door, and groped his way to a descending
elevator.And somehow he lived through that terror-haunted day and
night.But very early next morning, while his blurred eyes were drinking in
the startling report of the Simiti Company's collapse, as set forth in
the newspaper which he clutched in his shaking hand, the maid led in a
soft-stepping gentleman, who laid a hand upon his quaking shoulder and
read to him from a familiar-looking document an irresistible
invitation to take up lodgings in the city jail.*       *       *       *       *

There were other events forward at the same time, which came to light
that fateful next day.Hawley-Crowles, after a
night of mingled worry and anger over the deliberate or unintentional
exclusion of herself and Carmen from the Ames reception the preceding
night, descended to her combined breakfast and luncheon.At her plate
lay the morning mail, including a letter from France.She tore it
open, hastily scanned it, then dropped with a gasp into her chair."Father--married to--a French--adventuress!The long-cherished hope of a speedy inheritance of his snug fortune
lay blasted at her feet.The telephone bell rang sharply, and she rose dully to answer it.The
call came from the city editor of one of the great dailies."It is
reported," said the voice, "that your ward, Miss Carmen Ariza, is the
illegitimate daughter of a <DW64> priest, now in South America.We
would like your denial, for we learn that it was for this reason that
you and the young lady were not included among the guests at the Ames
reception last evening."Hawley-Crowles's legs tottered under her, as she blindly wandered
from the telephone without replying.Carmen--the daughter of a priest!Her father a <DW64>--her mother, what?The stunned woman mechanically took up the morning paper which lay on
the table.Her glance was at once attracted to the great headlines
announcing the complete exposure of the Simiti bubble.Her eyes nearly
burst from her head as she grasped its fatal meaning to her.With a
low, inarticulate sound issuing from her throat, she turned and groped
her way back to her boudoir.*       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, the automobile in which Carmen was speeding to the
Beaubien mansion was approached by a bright, smiling young woman, as
it halted for a moment at a street corner.Carmen recognized her as
a reporter for one of the evening papers, who had called often at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion that season for society items."I was on my way
to see you.Our office received a report this morning from some source
that your father--you know, there has been some mystery about your
parentage--that he was really a priest, of South America.His
name--let me think--what did they say it was?"The problem
of her descent had really become a source of amusement to her."It began with a D, if I am not mistaken.I'm not up on Spanish
names," the young woman returned pleasantly."Well, I'm sure I can't say."But--you think it was, don't you?""Well, I don't believe it was Padre Diego--he wasn't a good man."I was in his house, in Banco.He used to insist that I
was his child."By the way, you knew a woman named Jude, didn't you?But she took you out of a house down on--"

"Yes.And I've tried to find her ever since.""You know Father Waite, too, the ex-priest?""You and he going to work together, I suppose?""Why, I'm sure I don't know.You think this Diego might
have been your father?That is, you can't say positively that he
wasn't?"You can come up to the
house and talk about South America, if you want to."She nodded pleasantly, and the car moved away.The innocent, ingenuous
girl was soon to learn what modern news-gathering and dissemination
means in this great Republic.But she rode on, happy in the thought
that she and the Beaubien were formulating plans to save Mrs."We'll arrange it somehow," said the Beaubien, looking up from her
papers when Carmen entered."Go, dearie, and play the organ while I
finish this.Then I will return home with you to have a talk with Mrs.For hours the happy girl lingered at the beloved organ.The Beaubien
at her desk below stopped often to listen.And often she would hastily
brush away the tears, and plunge again into her papers."I suppose I
should have told Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," she said."But I couldn't give
her any hope.And yet," she reflected
sadly, "who would believe _me_?"The morning papers lay still unread
upon her table.Late in the afternoon the Beaubien with Carmen entered her car and
directed the chauffeur to drive to the Hawley-Crowles home.As they
entered a main thoroughfare they heard the newsboys excitedly crying
extras.Of a sudden a vague, unformed presentiment of impending evil came to
the girl.She half rose, and clutched the Beaubien's hand.Then there
flitted through her mind like a beam of light the words of the
psalmist: "A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee."She sank back against
the Beaubien's shoulder and closed her eyes.Presently the chauffeur turned and said something
through the speaking tube.cried the Beaubien, springing from the seat.A loud cry escaped her as she took the sheet and glanced at the
startling headlines.James Hawley-Crowles, financially ruined,
and hurled to disgrace from the pinnacle of social leadership by the
awful exposure of the parentage of her ward, had been found in her
bedroom, dead, with a revolver clasped in her cold hand.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The chill winds of another autumn swirled through the masonry-lined
canons of the metropolis and sighed among the stark trees of its
deserted parks.They caught up the tinted leaves that dropped from
quivering branches and tossed them high, as Fate wantons with human
hopes before she blows her icy breath upon them.They shrieked among
the naked spars of the _Cossack_, drifting with her restless master
far out upon the white-capped waves.They moaned in low-toned agony
among the marble pillars of the Crowles mausoleum, where lay in
pitying sleep the misguided woman whose gods of gold and tinsel had
betrayed her.On the outskirts of the Bronx, in a newly opened suburb, a slender
girl, with books and papers under her arm, walked slowly against the
sharp wind, holding her hat with her free hand, and talking rapidly to
a young man who accompanied her.Toward them came an old <DW64>,
leaning upon a cane.As he stepped humbly aside to make room, the girl
looked up.Then, without stopping, she slipped a few coins into his
coat pocket as she passed.The <DW64> stood in dumb amazement.He was poor--his clothes were thin
and worn--but he was not a beggar--he had asked nothing.The girl
turned and threw back a smile to him.Then of a sudden there came into
the old man's wrinkled, care-lined face such a look, such a
comprehension of that love which knows neither Jew nor Gentile, Greek
nor Barbarian, as would have caused even the Rabbis, at the cost of
defilement, to pause and seek its heavenly meaning.A few blocks farther on the strong wind sternly disputed the girl's
right to proceed, and she turned with a merry laugh to her companion.But as she stood, the wind fell, leaving a heap of dead leaves about
her feet.She stooped and
took up a two-dollar bill.Her companion threw her a wondering look; but the girl made no
comment.In silence they went on, until a few minutes more of brisk
walking brought them to a newly built, stucco-coated bungalow.Running
rapidly up the steps, the girl threw wide the door and called, "Mother
dear!"The Beaubien rose from her sewing to receive the hearty embrace.she said, devouring the sparkling creature with eager
eyes.Lewis begins his law course at once, and I may take
what I wish.Hitt's coming to call to-night and bring a
friend, a Mr.The Beaubien drew the girl to her and kissed her again and again.Then
she glanced over her shoulder at the man with a bantering twinkle in
her eyes and said, "Don't you wish you could do that?"Yes he can, too, mother," asserted the girl."I'm afraid it wouldn't look well," he said."And, besides, I don't dare lose my heart to her."With a final squeeze the girl tore herself from the Beaubien's
reluctant arms and hurried to the little kitchen."What is it
to-night, Jude?"she demanded, catching the domestic in a vigorous
embrace."Well, then, liver and bacon, with floating island," she whispered,
very mysteriously.Returning to the little parlor, Carmen encountered the fixed gaze of
both the Beaubien and Father Waite.she demanded, stopping and
looking from one to the other.said the Beaubien, in a tone of mock
severity."Oh," laughed the girl, running to the woman and seating herself in
the waiting lap, "he told, didn't he?Can't I ever trust you with a
secret?"in a tone of rebuke, turning to the man."Surely," he replied, laughing; "and I should not have divulged
this had I not seen in the incident something more than mere
chance--something meant for us all.""I--I think I have seen the working of a
stupendous mental law--am I not right?""You saw
a need, and met it, unsolicited.You found your own in another's
good."The girl smiled at the Beaubien without replying."What about it,
dearie?""She need not answer," said Father Waite, "for we know.She but cast
her bread upon the unfathomable ocean of love, and it returned to her,
wondrously enriched.""If you are going to talk about me, I shall not stay," declared
Carmen, rising.And she departed for the
kitchen, but not without leaving a smile for each of them as she went.The Beaubien and Father Waite remained some moments in silence."She is the light that is
guiding me.This little incident which you have just related is but a
manifestation of the law of love by which she lives.She gave,
unasked, and with no desire to be seen and advertised.There was no chance, no
miracle, no luck about it.It was--it
was--only the working of her beloved Christ-principle.if
we only knew--"

"We _shall_ know, Madam!""Her secret is
but the secret of Jesus himself, which was open to a world too dull to
comprehend.And," his eyes brightening, "to
that end I have been formulating a great plan.That's why I've asked
Hitt to come here to-night.Remember, my
dear friend, we are true searchers; and 'all things work together for
good to them that love God.'Our love of truth and real good is so
great that, like the consuming desire of the Jewish nation, it is
_bound_ to bring the Christ!"*       *       *       *       *

For three months the Beaubien and Carmen had dwelt together in this
lowly environment; and here they had found peace, the first that the
tired woman had known since childhood.The sudden culmination of those
mental forces which had ejected Carmen from society, crushed Ketchim
and a score of others, and brought the deluded Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to
a bitter end, had left the Beaubien with dulled sensibilities.Even
Ames himself had been shocked into momentary abandonment of his
relentless pursuit of humanity by the unanticipated _denouement_.But
when he had sufficiently digested the newspaper accounts wherein were
set forth in unsparing detail the base rumors of the girl's parentage
and of her removal from a brothel before her sudden elevation to
social heights, he rose in terrible wrath and prepared to hunt down to
the death the perpetrators of the foul calumny.Whence had come this
tale, which even the girl could not refute?He had
sailed for Europe--though but a day before.The man was
cringing like a craven murderer in his cell, for none dared give him
bail.Was it revenge for his own sharp move in regard to
La Libertad?He would have given all he possessed to lay his heavy
hands upon the guilty ones!The editors of the great newspapers,
perhaps?Ames raged like a wounded lion in the office of every editor
in the city.But they were perfectly safe, for the girl, although she
told a straightforward story, could not say positively that the
published statements concerning her were false.Yet, though few knew
it, there were two city editors and several reporters who, in the days
immediately following, found it convenient to resign their positions
and leave the city before the awful wrath of the powerful man.And, after weeks of terror, that
browbeaten woman, her hair whitening under the terrible persecution of
her relentless master, fled secretly, with her terrified daughter, to
England, whither the stupified Duke of Altern and his scandalized
mother had betaken themselves immediately following the expose.Thereupon Ames's lawyer drew up a bill of divorce, alleging desertion,
and laid it before the judge who fed from his master's hand.Meantime, the devouring wrath of Ames swept like a prairie fire over the
dry, withering stalks of the smart set.He vowed he would take Carmen
and flaunt her in the faces of the miserable character-assassins who
had sought her ruin!He swore he would support her with his untold
millions and force society to acknowledge her its queen!He had it
in his power to wreck the husband of every arrogant, supercilious
dame in the entire clique!He commenced at once with the unfortunate
Gannette.The latter, already tottering, soon fell before the subtle
machinations of Hodson and his able cohorts.Then, as a telling example
to the rest, Ames pursued him to the doors of the Lunacy Commission,
and rested not until that body had condemned his victim to a living
death in a state asylum.Kane, Fitch, and Weston fled to cover, and
concentrated their guns upon their common enemy.The Beaubien alone
stood out against him for three months.Her existence was death in
life; but from the hour that she first read the newspaper intelligence
regarding Carmen and the unfortunate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, she hid the
girl so completely that Ames was effectually balked in his attempts at
drastic vindication in her behalf.But this served only to intensify his anger, and he thereupon turned
its full force upon the lone woman.Driven to desperation, she stood
at length at bay and hurled at him her remaining weapon.Again the
social set was rent, and this time by the report that the black cloud
of bigamy hung over Ames.It was a fat season for the newspapers, and
they made the most of it.As a result, several of them found
themselves with libel suits on their hands.The Beaubien herself was
confronted with a suit for defamation of character, and was obliged to
testify before the judge whom Ames owned outright that she had but the
latter's word for the charge, and that, years since, in a moment of
maudlin sentimentalism, he had confessed to her that, as far as he
knew, the wife of his youth was still living.Ames then took his heavy toll, and retired within himself to sulk
and plan future assaults and reprisals.The Beaubien, crushed, broken, sick at heart, gathered up the scant
remains of her once large fortune, disposed of her effects, and
withdrew to the outskirts of the city.She would have left the
country, but for the fact that the tangled state of her finances
necessitated her constant presence in New York while her lawyers
strove to bring order out of chaos and placate her raging persecutor.To flee meant complete abandonment of her every financial resource to
Ames.And so, with the assistance of Father Waite and Elizabeth Wall,
who placed themselves at once under her command, she took a little
house, far from the scenes of her troubles, and quietly removed
thither with Carmen.One day shortly thereafter a woman knocked timidly at her door.Carmen
saw the caller and fled into her arms.The woman had come to return the string of pearls which the girl had
thrust into her hands on the night of the Charity Ball.She had not been able to bring herself to sell them.She
had wanted--oh, she knew not what, excepting that she wanted to see
again the girl whose image had haunted her since that eventful night
when the strange child had wandered into her abandoned life.Yes, she
would have given her testimony as to Carmen; but who would have
believed her, a prostitute?And--but the radiant girl gathered her in
her arms and would not let her go without a promise to return.And each time there was a change in
her.The Beaubien always forced upon her a little money and a promise
to come back.It developed that Jude was cooking in a cheap down-town
restaurant."Why not for us, mother, if she will?"And, though the sin-stained woman demurred and protested her
unworthiness, yet the love that knew no evil drew her irresistibly,
and she yielded at length, with her heart bursting.Then, in her great joy, Carmen's glad cry echoed through the little
house: "Oh, mother dear, we're free, we're free!"But the Beaubien was not free.Night after night her sleepless pillow
was wet with bitter tears of remorse, when the accusing angel stood
before her and relentlessly revealed each act of shameful meanness, of
cruel selfishness, of sordid immorality in her wasted life.And,
lastly, the weight of her awful guilt in bringing about the
destruction of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles lay upon her soul like a mountain.Oh, if she had only foreseen even a little of it!Oh, that Carmen had
come to her before--or not at all!And yet she could not wish that she
had never known the girl.The day of judgment was bound
to come.And, but for the comforting presence of
that sweet child, she had long since become a raving maniac.It was
Carmen who, in those first long nights of gnawing, corroding remorse,
wound her soft arms about the Beaubien's neck, as she lay tossing in
mental agony on her bed, and whispered the assurances of that infinite
Love which said, "Behold, I make all things new!"It was Carmen who
whispered to her of the everlasting arms beneath, and of the mercy
reflected by him who, though on the cross, forgave mankind because of
their pitiable ignorance.It is ignorance, always ignorance of what
constitutes real good, that makes men seek it through wrong channels.The Beaubien had sought good--all the world does--but she had never
known that God alone is good, and that men cannot find it until they
reflect Him.And so she had "missed the mark."Oh, sinful, mesmerized
world, ye shall find Me--the true good--only when ye seek Me with all
your heart!And yet, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins."Only a God who is love could voice such a promise!And Carmen knew;
and she hourly poured her great understanding of love into the empty
heart of the stricken Beaubien.Then at last came days of quiet, and planning for the future.The
Beaubien would live--yes, but not for herself.Nay, that life had gone
out forever, nor would mention of it pass her lips again.The
Colombian revolution--her mendacious connivances with Ames--her
sinful, impenitent life of gilded vice--aye, the door was now closed
against that, absolutely and forever more.She had passed through the
throes of a new birth; she had risen again from the bed of anguish;
but she rose stripped of her worldly strength.Carmen was now the
staff upon which she leaned.And Carmen--what had been her thought when foul calumny laid its sooty
touch upon her?What had been the working of her mind when that world
which she had sought to illumine with the light of her own purity had
cast her out?When the blow fell the portals of her mind closed at once against
every accusing thought, against every insidious suggestion of defeat,
of loss, of dishonor.The arrows of malice, as well as those of
self-pity and condemnation, snapped and fell, one by one, as they
hurtled vainly against the whole armor of God wherewith the girl stood
clad.Self sank into service; and she gathered the bewildered,
suffering Beaubien into her arms as if she had been a child.She would
have gone to Ames, too, had she been permitted--not to plead for
mercy, but to offer the tender consolation and support which, despite
the havoc he was committing, she knew he needed even more than the
Beaubien herself."Paul had been a murderer," she often said, as she sat in the darkness
alone with the suffering woman and held her trembling hand."But he
became the chief of apostles.When the light came, he
shut the door against the past.If he hadn't, dearest, he never could
have done what he did.Ames, will have to do the
same."And this the Beaubien could do, and did, after months of
soul-racking struggle.But Ames sat in spiritual darkness, whipped by
the foul brood of lust and revenge, knowing not that the mountainous
wrath which he hourly heaped higher would some day fall, and bury him
fathoms deep.Throughout the crisis Father Waite had stood by them stanchly."I've just longed for some reasonable
excuse to become a social outcast," the latter had said, as she was
helping Carmen one day to pack her effects prior to removing from the
Hawley-Crowles mansion."I long for a hearthstone to which I can
attach myself--"

"Then attach yourself to ours!""For I know that now you are really
going to live--and I want to live as you will.Moreover--" She paused
and smiled queerly at the girl--"I am quite in love with your hero,
Father Waite, you know."Harris, too, made a brief call before departing again for Denver."I've got to hustle for a living now," he explained, "and it's me for
the mountains once more!New York is no place for such a tender lamb
as I. Oh, I've been well trimmed--but I know enough now to keep away
from this burg!"While he was yet speaking there came a loud ring at the front door of
the little bungalow, followed immediately by the entrance of the
manager of a down-town vaudeville house.He plunged at once into his
errand.He would offer Carmen one hundred dollars a week, and a
contract for six months, to appear twice daily in his theater.but she did put it over
the society ginks."And the Beaubien, shivering at the awful
proposal, was glad Harris was there to lead the zealous theatrical man
firmly to the door.Lastly, came one Amos A. Hitt, gratuitously, to introduce himself as
one who knew Cartagena and was likely to return there in the not
distant future, where he would be glad to do what he might to remove
the stain which had been laid upon the name of the fair girl.The
genuineness of the man stood out so prominently that the Beaubien took
him at once into her house, where he was made acquainted with Carmen."Oh," cried the girl, "Cartagena!Why, I wonder--do you know Padre
Jose de Rincon?""A priest who once taught there in the University, many years ago?And
who was sent up the river, to Simiti?Then Carmen fell upon his neck; and there in that moment was begun a
friendship that grew daily stronger, and in time bore richest fruit.It soon became known that Hitt was giving a course of lectures that
fall in the University, covering the results of his archaeological
explorations; so Carmen and Father Waite went often to hear him.And
the long breaths of University atmosphere which the girl inhaled
stimulated a desire for more.Besides, Father Waite had some time
before announced his determination to study there that winter, as long
as his meager funds would permit."I shall take up law," he had one day said."It will open to me the
door of the political arena, where there is such great need of real
men, men who stand for human progress, patriotism, and morality.I
shall seek office--not for itself, but for the good I can do, and the
help I can be in a practical way to my fellow-men.Carmen shared the inspiration; and so she, too, with the Beaubien's
permission, applied for admittance to the great halls of learning, and
was accepted.*       *       *       *       *

"And now," began Father Waite that evening, when Hitt and his friend
had come, and, to the glad surprise of Carmen, Elizabeth Wall had
driven up in her car to take the girl for a ride, but had yielded to
the urgent invitation to join the little conference, "my plan, in
which I invite you to join, is, briefly, _to study this girl_!"Carmen's eyes opened wide, and her face portrayed blank amazement, as
Father Waite stood pointing gravely to her.Nor were the others less
astonished--all but the Beaubien."Let me explain," Father Waite continued."We are assembled here
to-night as representatives, now or formerly, of very diversified
lines of human thought.I have stood as the
embodiment of Christly claims, as the active agent of one of the
mightiest of human institutions, the ancient Christian Church.For
years I have studied its accepted authorities and its all-inclusive
assumptions, which embrace heaven, earth, and hell.For years I sought
with sincere consecration to apply its precepts to the dire needs of
humanity.I have traced its origin in the dim twilight of the
Christian era and its progress down through the centuries, through
heavy vicissitudes to absolute supremacy, on down through schisms and
subsequent decline, to the present hour, when the great system seems
to be gathering its forces for a life and death stand in this, the New
World.I have known and associated with its dignitaries and its humble
priests.I know the policies and motives underlying its quiet
movements.And so I
withdrew from it my allegiance."Carmen's thought, as she listened, was busy with another whose
experience had not been dissimilar, but about whom the human coils had
been too tightly wound to be so easily broken.Hitt," Father Waite went on, "represented
the great protest against the abuses and corruption which permeated
the system for which I stood.He, like myself, embodied the eternal
warfare of the true believer against the heretic.Yet, without my
churchly system, I was taught to believe, he and those who share his
thought are damned.we both claimed the same
divine Father, and accepted the Christly definition of Him as Love.We
were two brothers of the same great family, yet calling each other
_anathema_!""And to-day," he continued, "we
brothers are humbly meeting on the common ground of failure--failure
to understand the Christ, and to meet the needs of our fellow-men with
our elaborate systems of theology.""I heard another priest, years ago, make a similar confession," said
Hitt reflectively."I would he were here to-night!""He is here, in spirit," replied Father Waite; "for the same spirit of
eager inquiry and humble desire for truth that animates us no doubt
moved him.I have reason to think so," he added, looking at Carmen."For this girl's spiritual development I believe to be very largely
his work."He knew but little as yet of her
past association with the priest Jose.Hitt, represented the greatest systems of so-called
Christian belief," pursued Father Waite."Madam Beaubien, on the other
hand, has represented the world that waits, as yet vainly, for
redemption.We have not been able to afford it her.Yet--pardon my
frankness in thus referring to you, Madam.It is only to benefit us
all--that the means of redemption _have_ been brought to her, we must
now admit."She started to speak, but Father
Waite raised a detaining hand."Miss Wall
represents the weariness of spirit and unrest abroad in the world
to-day, the spirit that finds life not worth the while; and Mr.Haynerd voices the cynical disbelief, the agnosticism, of that great
class who can not accept the childish tenets of our dogmatic systems
of theology, yet who have nothing but the philosophy of stoicism or
epicureanism to offer in substitute.""You have me correctly classified," he said."I'm a Yankee, and from Missouri.""And now, having placed us," said the Beaubien, "how will you classify
Carmen?"Father Waite looked at the girl reverently."Hers is the leaven," he
replied gently, "which has leavened the whole lump."My good friends," he went on earnestly, "like all priests and
preachers, I have been but a helpless spectator of humanity's
troubles.I have longed and prayed to know how to do the works which
Jesus is said to have done; yet, at the sick-bed or the couch of
death, what could I do--I, to whom the apostolic virtue is supposed to
have descended in the long line of succession?I could give promises of
remitted sins--though I knew I spoke not truth.I could comfort by
voicing the insipid views of our orthodox heaven.And yet I know that
what I gave was but mental nostrums, narcotics, to stupify until death
might end the suffering."And if you were a good orthodox priest," interposed Haynerd, "you
would refuse burial to dissenters, and bar from your communion table
all who were not of your faith, eh?""I would have to, were I consistent; for Catholicism is
the only true faith, founded upon the revealed word of God, you know."He smiled pathetically as he looked around at the little group."Now," he continued, "you, Mr.Haynerd, are a man of the world.You
are not in sympathy with the Church.You are an infidel, an
unbeliever.And therefore are you '_anathema_,' you know.""But you can not deny that at times you think very
seriously.And, I may go farther: you long, intensely, for something
that the world does not offer.Now, what is it but truth that you are
seeking?""I want to know," answered Haynerd quickly.I
am fond of exhibitions of sleight-of-hand and jugglery.But the
priestly thaumaturgy that claims to transform a biscuit into the
flesh of a man dead some two thousand years, and a bit of grape juice
into his blood, irritates me inexpressibly!And so does the
jugglery by which your Protestant fellows, Hitt, attempt to reconcile
their opposite beliefs.Why, what difference can it possibly make
to the Almighty whether we miserable little beings down here are
baptised with water, milk, or kerosene, or whether we are immersed,
sprinkled, or well soused?for nearly twenty centuries
you have been wandering among the non-essentials.Isn't it time to get
down to business, and instead of burning at the stake every one who
differs with you, try conscientiously to put into practice a few of
the simple moral precepts, such as the Golden Rule, and loving
one's neighbor as one's self?""There," commented Father Waite, "you have a bit of the world's
opinion of the Church!Can we say that the censure is not just?Would
not Christ himself to-day speak even more scathingly to those who
advocate a system of belief that puts blinders on men's minds, and
then leads them into the pit of ignorance and superstition?""Ye have taken away the key of knowledge," murmured Carmen; "ye
entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye
hindered."exclaimed Haynerd, looking at the girl who stood as a
living protest against all that hampers the expansion of the human
mind; that quenches its note of joy, and dulls its enlarging and ever
nobler concept of God."Now I want to know, first, if there is a God;
and, if so, what He is, and what His relation is to me.I want to know
what I am, and why I am here, and what future I may look forward to,
if any.I don't care two raps about a God who can't help me here on
earth, who can't set me right and make me happy--cure my ills, meet my
needs, and supply a few of the luxuries as well.And if there is a
God, and we can meet Him only by dying, then why in the name of common
sense all this hullabaloo about death?Why, in that case, death is the
grandest thing in life!But
you preacher fellows fight death tooth and nail.You're scared stiff
when you contemplate it.You make Christianity just a grand
preparation for death.Yet it isn't the gateway to life to you, and
you know it!Then why, if you are honest, do you tell such rubbish to
your trusting followers?""I would remind you," returned Hitt with a little laugh, "that I
don't, now.""Well, friends," interposed Father Waite, "it is to take up for
earnest consideration just such questions as Mr.Haynerd propounds,
that I have my suggestion to make, namely, that we meet together once
or twice a week, or as often as we may agree upon, to search for--"
his voice dropped to a whisper--"to search for God, and with this
young girl as our guide.For I believe she is very close to Him.The
world knows God only by hearsay.Carmen has _proved_ Him."Men ask why it is," he went on, "that God remains hidden from them;
why they can not understand Him.They forget that Jesus revealed God
as Love.And, if that is so, in order to know Him all mankind must
love their fellow-men.But they go right on hating one another,
cheating, abusing, robbing, slaying, persecuting, and still wondering
why they don't know God, regardless of the only possible way of ever
working out from the evils by which they are beset, if we believe that
Jesus told the truth, or was correctly reported."He paused and
reflected for a moment.Then:

"The ancient prophet said: 'Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye
shall search for me with all your hearts.'It is my proposal that we
bind ourselves together in such a search.To it we can bring diverse
talents.To our vast combined worldly experience, I bring knowledge of
the ancient Greek and Latin Fathers, together with Church history.Hitt brings his command of the Hebrew language and history, and an
intimate acquaintance with the ancient manuscripts, and Biblical
interpretation, together with a wide knowledge of the physical
sciences.Madam Beaubien, Miss Wall, and Mr.Haynerd contribute their
earnest, searching, inquisitive spirit, and a knowledge of the world's
needs.Moreover, we all come together without bias or prejudice.And
Carmen--she contributes that in which we have all been so woefully
lacking, and without which we can _never_ know God, the rarest,
deepest spirituality.Shall we
undertake the search, my friends?It means a study of her thought, and
the basis upon which it rests."The Beaubien raised her hand to her moist eyes.She was thinking of
that worldly coterie which formerly was wont to meet nightly in her
magnificent mansion to prey upon their fellows.Oh, how different the
spirit of this little gathering!"You will meet here, with me," she said in a broken voice.There were none there unacquainted with the sorrows of this penitent,
broken woman.Each rose in turn and clasped her hand.Carmen threw
her arms about her neck and kissed her repeatedly."You see," said the Beaubien, smiling up through her tears, "what this
child's religion is?Would the swinging of incense burners and the
mumbling of priestly formulae enhance it?""Jesus said, 'Having seen me ye have seen God,'" said Father Waite."And I say," replied the Beaubien, "that having seen this child, you
have indeed seen Him."CHAPTER 2


"I'm afraid," Haynerd was saying, as he and Father Waite were wending
their way to the Beaubien home a few evenings later, "that this Carmen
is the kind of girl you read about in sentimental novels; the kind who
are always just ready to step into heaven, but who count for little in
the warfare and struggle of actual mundane existence.She
isn't quite true to life, you know, as a book critic would say of an
impossible heroine.""You mistake, my friend," replied Father Waite warmly."She is the
very kind we would see oftener, were it not for the belief that years
bring wisdom, and so, as a consequence, the little child is crushed
beneath a load of false beliefs and human laws that make it reflect
its mortal parents, rather than its heavenly one.""But I'd like to see her under stress--"

"Under stress!You haven't the slightest conception
of the stress she's been under most of her life!But your criticism
unconsciously pays her the highest tribute, for her kind never show by
word, deed, or look what they are enduring.That frail-appearing girl
has stood up under loads that would have flattened you and me out like
gold leaf!"She's so far and away ahead
of mortals like you and me that she doesn't admit the reality and
power of evil--and, believe me, she's got her reasons for not
admitting it, too!Only try humbly to
attain a little of her understanding and faith; and try to avoid
making yourself ridiculous by criticising what you do not comprehend.That, indeed, has been mankind's age-long blunder--and they have
thereby made asses of themselves!"Edward Haynerd, or "Ned," as he was invariably known, prided himself
on being something of a philosopher.And in the name of philosophy he
chose to be quixotic.That one who hated the dissimulations and shams
of our class aristocracy so cordially should have earned his
livelihood--and a good one, too--as publisher of the Social Era, a
sprightly weekly chronicle of happenings in fashionable society, would
have appeared anomalous in any but a man gifted in the Greek
sophistries and their modern innumerable and arid offshoots.Haynerd
was a laughing Democritus, an easy-going, even-tempered fellow, doomed
to be loved, and by the same graces thoroughly cheated by the world in
general.He had in his rapid career of some thirty-five years dipped
deeply into things mundane, and had come to the surface, sputtering
and blowing, with his face well smeared with mud from the shallow
depths.Whereupon he remarked that such an existence was a poor way of
serving the Lord, and turned cynic.It
was likewise his capital and stock-in-trade.By it he won a place for
himself in the newspaper world, and later, as a credit asset, had
employed it successfully in negotiating for the Social Era.It taking
over the publication of this sheet he had remarked that life was
altogether too short to permit of attempting anything worth while; and
so he forthwith made no further assaults upon fame--assuming that he
had ever done so--but settled comfortably down to the enjoyment of his
sinecure.And as justification for his
self-imposed celibacy he pompously quoted Kant: "I am a bachelor, and
I could not cease to be a bachelor without a disturbance that would be
intolerable to me."He simply shirked
responsibility and ease-threatening risk."You see," he remarked, explaining himself later to Carmen, "I'm a
pseudo-litterateur--I conduct a 'Who's It?'for the quidnunces of this
blase old burg.And I really meet a need by furnishing an easy method
of suicide, for my little vanity sheet is a sort of social mirror,
that all who look therein may die of laughter.By the way, I had to
run those base squibs about you; but, by George!I'm going to make a
retraction in next Saturday's issue.I'll put a crimp in friend Ames
that'll make him squeal.I'll say he has ten wives, and eight of 'em
Zulus, at that!""We have enough to meet, without
going out of our way to stir up more.Let it all work out now, as it
will, in the right way."Say, don't you
think that in formulating a new religion you're carrying coals to
Newcastle?Seems to me we've got enough now, if we'd practice 'em."Haynerd, is only the practice of the teachings of a
Nazarene Jew, named Jesus," she replied gently."Well, my religion is Socialism, I guess," he said lightly.So we
meet on common ground, don't we?"She held out her hand, and he took
it, a puzzled expression coming into his face."Well," he said, glancing about, "we'll have to dispute that later.I
see Father Waite is about to open this little religious seminar.But
we'll get back to the discussion of myself," he added, his eyes
twinkling."For, like Thoreau, I prefer to discuss that subject,
because there's no other about which I know so much.""Nor so little," she added, laughing and squeezing his hand as she
turned from him.The little coterie took their places around the dining room table,
which was well strewn with books of reference and writing materials.A deep, reverent silence fell
upon the group."Friends," began Father Waite slowly, "we are inaugurating to-night a
mission of the most profound significance.No question so vitally
touches the human race as the one which we shall reverently discuss in
this and subsequent meetings.I thought as I came in here to-night of
the wisdom of Epictitus, who said, 'What do I want?To acquaint myself
with the true order of things and comply with it.'I am sure no
statement so fully expresses our common desire as that.""If Adam was a Baptist, I want to know
and comply with the fact."Then Father Waite held up a hand and again
became serious."Can we treat lightly even the Adam story, when we consider how much
misery and rancor its literal acceptance has caused among mankind?Out of deepest sympathy for a world in search of truth, let us pity
their stumblings, and take heed that we fall not ourselves."Carmen's hand stole toward the
Beaubien's and clasped it tightly."In these days, as of old, it is still said, 'There is no God!'And
yet, though the ignorant and wilful admit it not, mankind's very
existence is a function of their concept of a Creator, a sole
cause of all that is.No question, economic, social, political, or
other, is so vitally related to humanity as this: 'Is there a God?'And the corollary: 'What is His relation to me?'For there can be
nothing so important as a knowledge of truth.Can the existence
of a God be demonstrated?Can He be shown to be beneficent, in
view of the world's testimony?If the
Bible, then can its authenticity be established?The greatest of
our so-called civilizations are known as Christian.But who can say
by them what Christianity really is?""I am quite prepared to say what it is not!""Doubtless," resumed Father Waite.But at present
we are seeking constructive criticism, not solely destructive.There
has been quite enough of that sort in the world.But, to go a step
further, can we say positively that the truth is to be found even in
Christianity?""Please explain your question," said Miss Wall, with a puzzled look."The first essential is always facts," he continued."The deduction of
right conclusions will follow--provided, as Matthew Arnold so tersely
said, we have sufficient delicacy of perception, subtlety, wisdom, and
tact.And, I may add, sufficient freedom from prejudice and mental
bias--ah, there is the stumbling block!""Matthew Arnold," ventured Haynerd, "was dubbed a first-class infidel,
as I recall it."As have been many of the world's most earnest searchers.Yet he enunciated much truth, which we to-day are acknowledging.But,
to resume, since Christianity as we know it is based upon the
personality of a man, Jesus, we ask: Can the historicity of Jesus be
established?"queried Miss Wall in greater
surprise than before.And if so, is he correctly reported in what we call the Gospels?Then, did he reveal the truth to his followers?And, lastly, has that
truth been correctly transmitted to us?""And," added Hitt, "there is still the question: Assuming that he gave
us the truth, can we apply it successfully to the meeting of our daily
needs?""The point is well taken," replied Father Waite."For, though I may
know that there are very abstruse mathematical principles, yet I may
be utterly unable to demonstrate or use them.But now," he went on,
"we are brought to other vital questions concerning us.They are, I
think, points to which the theologian has given but scant thought.If
we conclude that there is a God, we are confronted with the material
universe and man.And what are their natures and
import?""Seems to me you've cut out a large
assignment for this little party.Those are questions that the world
has played football with for thousands of years.Do you think we can
settle them in a few evenings' study?We can't spare you," laughed Father Waite.Then he glanced at
Carmen, who had sat quiet, apparently unhearing, during the remarks."I think you will hear things soon that will set you thinking," he
said."But now we are going to let our traveled friend, Mr.Hitt,
give us just a word in summation of his thought regarding the
modern world and its attitude toward the questions which we have been
propounding."The explorer leaned back in his chair and assumed his customary
attitude when in deep thought.All eyes turned upon him in eager
expectation."The world," he began reflectively, "presents to me to-day the most
interesting aspect it has assumed since history began.True, the age
is one of great mental confusion.Quite as true, startling discoveries
and astounding inventions have so upset our staid old mediaeval views
that the world is hurriedly crowding them out, together with its God.Doctrines for which our fathers bled and burned are to-day lightly
tossed upon the ash heap.The searchlight is turned never so
mercilessly upon the founder of the Christian religion, and upon the
manuscripts which relate his words and deeds.Yet most of us have
grown so busy--I often wonder with what--that we have no time for that
which can not be grasped as we run.We work desperately by day,
building up the grandest material fabric the world has ever seen; and
at night we repair the machine for the next day's run.Even our
college professors bewail the lack of time for solid reading and
research.And if our young pursue studies, it is with the almost
exclusive thought of education as a means of earning a material
livelihood later, and, if possible, rearing a mansion and stocking its
larder and garage.It is, I repeat, a grandly materialistic age,
wherein, to the casual observer, spirituality is at a very low ebb."He thrust his long legs under the table and cast his eyes upward to
the ceiling as he resumed:

"The modern world is still in its spiritual infancy, and does not
often speak the name of God.Not that we are so much irreverent as
that we feel no special need of Him in our daily pursuits.Since we
ceased to tremble at the thunders of Sinai, and their lingering echoes
in bulls and heresy condemnations, we find that we get along just as
well--indeed, much better.And it really is quite bad form now to
speak continually of God, or to refer to Him as anything real and
vital.To be on such terms of intimacy with Him as this girl Carmen
is--in thought, at least--would be regarded to-day as evidence of
sentimentalism and weakness."He paused again, to marshal his thought and give his auditors an
opportunity for comment.Then, as the silence remained unbroken, he
continued:

"Viewing the world from one standpoint, it has achieved remarkable
success in applying the knout to superstition and limitation.But,
like a too energetic housekeeper, it has swept out much that is
essential with the _debris_.When spirituality ceases to be real or
vital to a people, then a grave danger threatens them.Materiality has
never proved a blessing, as history shows.Life that is made up of
strain and ceaseless worry is not life.The incessant accumulation of
material wealth, when we do not know how really to enjoy it, is folly.To pamper the flesh, to the complete ignoring of the spirit, is
suicide.The increased hankering after physical excitements and animal
pleasures, to the utter abandonment of the search for that which is
real and satisfying, is an exhibition of gross, mesmeric stupidity, to
say the least.It shows that our sense of life is awry.""But the world is surely attempting its own betterment," protested
Haynerd."I grant you that," replied Hitt."But legislation and coercion are
the wrong means to employ."Oh, well, you are not going to change the race until the individual
himself changes.""Quite the contrary, that is the
pith of my observations.And no sane
man will maintain that general reform can ever come until the
individual's needs are met--his daily, hourly, worldly needs.""I think I get your point," said Father Waite."It is wholly a
question of man's concept of the cause of things, himself included,
and their purpose and end, is it not?""The restless spirit of the modern world is
hourly voicing its discontent with a faltering faith which has no
other basis than blind belief.It wants demonstrable fact upon which
to build.In plain words, _mankind would be better if they but knew
how_!""Well, we show them how," asserted Haynerd."But they don't do as we
tell 'em.""Are you quite sure that you show them how?""What do you
ever do toward showing them how permanently to eradicate a single
human difficulty?""Oh, well, putting it that way, nothing, of course."And so
the world continues to wait for surcease from woe in a life beyond the
grave.But now, returning to our survey, let me say that amid all the
folly of vain pursuits, of wars and strife, of doleful living and
pitiable dying, there are more encouraging and hopeful signs hung out
to the inquiring thought to-day than ever before in history.If I
misread not, we are already entered upon changes so tremendous that
their end must be the revolutionizing of thought and conduct, and
hence of life.Our present age is one of great extremes: though we
touch the depths, we are aiming likewise at the heights.I doubt if
there ever was a time when so many sensed the nothingness of the
pleasures of the flesh.I doubt if ever there was such a quickening of
the business conscience, and such a determined desire to introduce
honesty and purity into our dealings with one another.Never was the
need of religion more keenly felt by the world than it is to-day; and
that is why mankind are willing to accept any religious belief,
however eccentric, that comes in the guise of truth and bearing the
promise of surcease from sin, sickness, and sorrow here this side of
the grave.The world was never so hungry for religious truth; and this
fact is a perpetual challenge to the Church.There is a tremendous
world-yearning to know and to do better.I
answer, a growing appreciation of the idea that 'the kingdom of
harmony is within you.'""Jesus said that," murmured Carmen, looking up."He but amplified and gave form to the great fact that there was
an influence for better things always existent in the ancient Jews,
that'something not ourselves,' if you will, 'that makes for
righteousness.'And he showed that that influence could be outwardly
externalized in freedom from the ills which beset humanity.""Very good," put in Haynerd."That'something not ourselves' is the germ of the true idea of God,"
answered Hitt."The terms are synonymous," said Hitt."And now let me conclude with a
final observation.Mankind's beliefs are in a whirl.Orthodoxy and conservatism are hanging desperately to the
world's flying skirts, but they will eventually drop off.No change in
thought has been greater than that concerning God.The absentee Lord
who started the universe and then withdrew has gone to the scrap heap,
with the ridiculous views of predestination and infant damnation.The
idea of a God who at divers times interfered with His creation and
temporarily set aside His own laws to convince puny man of His
greatness, is likewise obsolescent.The world is slowly growing into a
conception of a creator, of some kind, but at least mental, and
universally present.Nay, more, available for all our problems and
needs.And the end will be the adoption of that conception, enlarged
and purified still further, and taken into the minutest affairs of our
daily life--as this girl has done.The day of patient suffering in
this world, under the spell of a promise of compensating reward in the
heavenly future, has all but passed.We are gradually becoming
conscious of the stupendous fact that the kingdom of all harmony,
immortality, and good, is _right here within us_--and therefore can be
naught but a consciousness of absolute good, perfectly attainable by
humanity as the 'old man' of Paul is laid off, but not gained,
necessarily, through what we call death."The silence which followed was broken at length by Miss Wall."And
what constitutes the 'old man'?""Largely, I think," said Hitt, "the belief that matter is real."exclaimed Haynerd, almost rising from his chair."I stand on my statement," he replied.Father Waite rose slowly, as if lost in thought."History shows," he
said, meditatively, "that man's progress has been proportionate to his
freedom from the limitation of ignorance and undemonstrable belief.And that freedom has come as man's concept of God has grown less and
less material, and more and more spiritual.From the animal nature of
the savage, to whom all is matter, down--or up--to the man of to-day,
to whom mind is assuming ever greater ascendency, man's progress has
been marked by a throwing off of limiting beliefs, theological or
other, in material power and substance.The development of the least
material forces, steam, electricity, the X-ray, has come only as the
human mind has thrown off a portion of its hampering material beliefs.I am astounded when I think of it, and of its marvelous message to
future generations!For, from the premise that the creator of all
things is spirit, or mind, as you will, comes the corollary that the
creation itself must of necessity be _mental_.And from this come such
deductions as fairly make me tremble.Carmen has told me of the
deductions which her tutor, the priest Jose, drew from the single
premise that the universe is infinite in extent--a premise which I
think we all will accept.""There can be no question about it," said Hitt, nodding his head."Well," continued Father Waite, "that granted, we must likewise grant
its creator to be infinite, must we not?""And that puts the creator out of the matter-class entirely.The
creator must be--"

"Mind," said Carmen, supplying the thought ever-present with her."I see no other conclusion," said Father Waite."But, that granted, a
flood of deductions pours in that sends human beliefs and reasoning
helter-skelter.For an infinite mind would eventually disintegrate if
it were not perfect in every part.""Perhaps it is already disintegrating, and that's what causes the evil
in the world," hazarded Haynerd."Utterly untenable, my friend," put in Hitt."For, granted an infinite
mind, we must grant the concomitant fact that such a mind is of very
necessity omnipotent, as well as perfect.What, then, could ever cause
disintegration in it?""You are right," resumed Father Waite."And such a mind, of very
necessity perfect, omnipotent, and, of course, ever-present, must
likewise be eternal.For there would be nothing to contest its
existence.Age, decay, and death would be unknown to it."And that," said Carmen, rising, "is my God."Father Waite nodded significantly to the others, and sat down, leaving
the girl facing them, her luminous eyes looking off into unfathomed
distances, and her face aglow with spiritual light."My God is infinite Good, to whom evil is unknown," she said."And
good includes all that is real.It includes wisdom, intelligence,
truth, life, and love--none of them material.Oh, not
by human reasoning, whereby you seek to establish the fact of His
existence, but by proof, daily proof, and in the hours when the floods
of suppositional evil have swept over me.You would rest your faith on
your deductions.But, as Saint Gregory said, no merit lies in faith
where human reason supplies the proof; and that you will all some day
know.And He ceaselessly expresses Himself in and
through His ideas, which He is constantly revealing.And these ideas express that goodness and
infinitude, from the tiniest up to the idea of God himself.And that
grandest idea is--man.Oh, no, not the men and women you think you see
about you in your daily walk.But the man that Jesus always saw back of every human concept.That
man is God's own idea of Himself.That is the man we shall all put on when we have
obeyed Paul and put off the old man, its counterfeit.""Then, Carmen," said Father Waite, "you believe all things to be
mental?""Yes, everything--man himself--and matter.""But, if God is mind, and infinite, He must include all things.Hence
He must include this imperfect representation, called the physical
man."Did not Jesus speak often of
the one lie about his Father, God?The material man and the material
universe are but parts of that lie.And a lie is always a supposition;
not real.All evil is contained in that supposition--a supposition
that there is power and life and substance apart from God.""A supposition is not made," replied Carmen quietly."I don't quite get that," interposed Miss Wall, her brows knitting.Carmen smiled down at the inquiring woman."The
creator of all things is mind.But you would have that
mind the creator of evil, also.Yet, your own reasoning has shown
that, on the premise of mind as infinite, such mind must be forever
whole, harmonious, perfect.The thoughts and ideas by which that mind
expresses itself must be likewise pure and perfect.Then that creative
mind can not create evil.For, a mind that creates evil must itself be
evil.And, being infinite, such a mind must include the evil it
creates.We would have, then, either a mind wholly evil, or one of
mixed evil and good.In either case, that mind must then destroy
itself."Your reasoning is, certainly," admitted Miss Wall."But, how to
account for evil, when God is infinite good--"

"To account for it at all," replied Carmen, "would be to make it
something real.Jesus would account for it only by classing it as a
lie about God.Now God, as the creative mind, must likewise be truth,
since He is perfection and harmony.Very well, a lie is always the
opposite of truth."Yes," said Father Waite, nodding his head as certain bright memories
returned to him."That is what you told me that day when I first
talked with you."Is it strange that God should have a suppositional opposite?""Has not everything with which you are concerned a
suppositional opposite?His suppositional opposite is
the great lie of evil.And matter is just as
mental as the thoughts which you are now holding.And so, evil and the lie are unreal.""The distinction seems to me theoretical," protested Miss Wall."That word'real,'" he said, "is perhaps
what is causing your confusion.The real is that which, according to
Spencer, does not pass away.We used to believe matter indestructible,
forever permanent.We learn that our views regarding it were very
incorrect."And yet," said Father Waite, "in this universe of constant change,
_something_ endures.What is it but the mind that is God, expressing
itself in such immaterial and permanent things as law, love, life,
power?""But now we have been brought back again to
the question of matter.If we can prove that matter is mental, and not
real substance, we will have established Carmen's premise that
everything is mental.Then there remains but the distinction between
the mind that is God, and its suppositional opposite, as expressed in
human existence.Let us conclude, therefore, that to-night we have
established, at least as a working hypothesis, that, since a thing
existing implies a creator; and since the existent universe, being
infinite, demands an infinite creator; and since a creator can not be
infinite without being at once mind, perfect, eternal, omnipotent,
omniactive, and good, we are fully justified in assuming that the
creator of all things still exists, and is infinite, ever-present
mind.Further than that we are not prepared to go, until we have
discussed the questions of matter and the physical universe and man.Let us leave those topics for a subsequent meeting.And now I suggest
that we unite in asking Carmen to sing for us, to crown the unity that
has marked this discussion with the harmony of her own beautiful
voice."A few moments later, about the small upright piano which the Beaubien
had rented for Carmen, the little group sat in reverent silence, while
the young girl sent out through the little room the harmonious
expression of her own inner life, the life that had never left heaven
for earth.CHAPTER 3


With her exit from the _beau monde_ and her entrance upon the broad
stage of University life, Carmen seemed to have awakened from the
lethargy which her abrupt transition from mediaeval Simiti into the
modern world had occasioned.The static struggle to hold her own
against the rushing currents of materialism had turned at length in
her favor.The lethal influences which
rose about her like stupifying fumes in the courts of fashion had been
lifted and swept away by the fresher and more invigorating breezes
into which her bark had now been drawn.She plunged into her new work joyously; yet not without a deeper
comprehension of its meaning than that of her fellow-students.She
knew that the University was but another stepping-stone, even as her
social life had been; another series of calls and opportunities to
"prove" her God to be immanent good.For she was keenly alive to the materialistic leadings of
the "higher education," and she would stand as a living protest
against them.It had not taken her long to discover the impotence lying at the heart
of so-called modern education.She had not been slow to mark the
disappointment written upon the faces of many of her fellow-students,
who had sought in vain a great awakening light in those sacred
precincts of learning, but, their confidence betrayed, were now
floundering in the devouring morass of materialism.To her keen
insight the University stood revealed as the great panderer to this
latest century's obsessing idea that the true function of education is
expressed in the imparting of changing, human information and a
training for the business of earning one's daily bread according to
the infamous code of the world's carnal social system.The University
did not meet the most urgent need of the race by equipping men to
stand against the great crises of human experience.It did not teach
men to lay aside the counterfeit man of material sense; but rather
emphasized the world's belief in the reality of this man by minutely
detailed courses in his mundane history and the manifestations of his
pitiable ignorance in his wanton crimes and watery ambitions.To
Carmen, God was the most insistent fact of creation.And mankind's
existence could find its only justification in ceaseless, consecrated
manifestation of His harmonious activity.True, the University vaguely
recognized God as infinitely competent.But in the same breath it
confessed its utter ignorance of a demonstrable knowledge of Him, to
know whom alone is life.But their hollow prayers bore no hope, for they knew not how to gain
answers to them.And yet the girl remained in her new environment, awaiting the call to
"come up higher."And meantime she strove to gain daily a wider
knowledge of the Christ-principle, and its application to the needs
and problems of her fellow-men.Her business was the reflection of her
Father's business.The weak, transient,
flighty, so-called intellectual life which she saw about her sent no
call across the calm currents of her thought.Her education was
religious in the strictest, deepest sense, for she was learning to
know God.Though the girl pursued her way quietly, unwilling that the notoriety
which had been fastened upon her should mark her as an object of
curiosity, yet her story soon spread among University circles, and the
first semester was a scant two weeks old before her name had been
debated in the numerous Sororities and Women's Clubs, and quietly
dropped.<DW64> blood coursed in her veins; and the stigma of parental
disgrace lay dark upon her.She lived with a woman of blackened
reputation--a reputation which waxed no brighter under the casual,
malicious comments of J. Wilton Ames, whose great financial strength
had made him a Trustee of this institution of learning.If Carmen
divined the comment that was passed concerning herself, she gave no
indication.But Hitt and Father Waite knew that the girl had not found
favor in the social and fraternal organizations of her mates; and they
knew why.mused Hitt, when he could no longer
restrain himself.Then he called a student to his desk one day, at the
conclusion of his lecture."Miss West," he said, "you are leader in the most prominent Sorority
in the University.I want you to give Miss Carmen Ariza a bid."the girl asked, as she arched her brows.But--well, what if she were a negress?Hers is the
most brilliant mind in the entire student-body!"Race segregation is a divine tenet, scripturally justified.What though the girl's skin vied with the lilies and rosebuds?What
though her hair was the brown of ripe fields?Had not God Almighty
decreed that the <DW64> should remain a drawer of water?Had the Lord designed him the equal of the noble white, He would
have bleached his face, and bridged his flat nose.And the reference to her dark-skinned sisters caused a
little _moue_ of disgust, as she flatly declined to consider Carmen an
eligible candidate for membership in her Society.ejaculated Hitt, who had been brooding over the incident
as he walked home with Father Waite."That toadying, sycophantic,
wealth-worshiping Miss West can see no farther than the epidermis!If
we could have maintained Carmen's reputation as an Inca princess, this
same girl would have fawned at her feet, and begged to kiss the edge
of her robe!And she would have used every art of cajolery to
ingratiate herself into Carmen's favor, to catch the social crumbs
that our girl might chance to drop!""There, there, Hitt," soothed Father Waite."Have you any idea that
Carmen is at all injured by Miss West's supercilious conduct?"You're forgetting the girl's influence, aren't
you?"Hitt gulped his wrath down his long throat."Waite," he blurted, "that
girl's an angel!"She's so real that we don't
understand her--so real that she has been totally misunderstood by the
petty minds that have sought to crush her here in New York, that's
all.""But certainly she is unique--"

"Ah, yes; unique in that she goes about putting her arms around people
and telling them that she loves them.And she is unique in that her purity and goodness hang about her like
an exquisite aura, and make people instinctively turn and look after
her as she passes.Unique in that in her sweet presence one seems to
hear a strain of heavenly music vibrating on the air.So unique that
the dawn, the nesting birds, the wild flowers, the daily sunset,
fairly intoxicate her with ecstasy and make her life a lyric."Hitt essayed to reply; but the words hung in his throat."Yes," continued Father Waite, "she is so unique that when the
empty-headed, vain young Duke of Altern, learning that she had been
thrown out of society because of the base rumor regarding her
parentage, sent her a written statement to the effect that there was
no engagement between them, and demanded that she sign it, she did
so, with a happy smile, with an invocation, with a prayer for blessing
upon those who had tried to ruin her."Hawley-Crowles and Ames and Lafelle
filched La Libertad from her, she would have given them the clothes on
her back with it, if they had demanded them.Yes, she's unique--so
unique that again and again I hear her murmur, as she looks off
absently into space: 'If it is right that he should have a son, then I
want it to be so.'""Referring to--that priest--Jose de Rincon?"And time and again I have heard her say: 'God is
light.Old
Rosendo's grandson, you know.""Waite," he said earnestly, "she is simply illustrating
what would happen to any of us if we threw ourselves wholly upon
God's protecting care, and took our thoughts only from Him.That's
why she can lose her home, her family, her reputation, that
mine--everything--and still stand._She does what we don't dare to
do!_"

"She is a living illustration," replied Father Waite, "of the mighty
fact that there is nothing so practical as _real_ Christianity.I want
you to tell Professor Cane that.He calls her 'the girl with the
Utopian views,' because of her ingenuous replies in his sociological
class.But I want you to show him that she is very far from being
impractical.""I'll do it," said Hitt emphatically."I'll prove to Cane that her
religion is not a visionary scheme for regulating a world inhabited
only by perfect beings, but is a working principle for the every-day
sinner to use in the solution of his daily problems.Moreover, Waite,
she is a vivid illustration of the fact that when the individual
improves, the nation does likewise."I not only get you, but I stand as a proof of your statement,"
returned Father Waite gently.Carmen, her thoughts above, though her feet trod the earth, came and
went, glad and happy.The change in her mode of living from the
supreme luxury of the Hawley-Crowles mansion to the common comforts of
the home where now she dwelt so simply with the Beaubien, seemed not
to have caused even a ripple in the full current of her joy.Her life
was a symphony of thanksgiving; an antiphony, in which all Nature
voiced its responses to her in a diapason, full, rich, and harmonious.Often that autumn she might have been seen standing among the tinted
leaves on the college campus, and drinking in their silent message.And then she might have been heard to exclaim, as she turned her rapt
gaze beyond the venerable, vine-clad buildings: "Oh, I feel as if I
just couldn't stand it, all this wealth of beauty, of love, of
boundless good!"For her dark
story had reared a hedge about her; the taboo rested upon her; and
even in the crowded classrooms the schoolmates of her own sex looked
askance and drew their skirts about them.But if the students avoided her, the faculty did not.And those like
Professor Cane, who had the opportunity and the ability to peer into
the depths of the girl's soul, took an immediate and increasing
interest in her.Often her own naive manners broke down the bars of
convention, and brought her enduring friendships among the men of
learning.This was especially the case with Doctor Morton, Dean of the
School of Surgery.Yielding to a harmless impulse of curiosity, the
girl one afternoon had set out on a trip of exploration, and had
chosen the Anatomy building to begin with.Many odd sights greeted her
eager gaze as she peered into classrooms and exhibit cases; but she
met with no one until she chanced to open the door of Doctor Morton's
private laboratory, and found that eminent man bending over a human
brain, which he was dissecting.The doctor looked up, surprise
written large upon his features as he noted his fair caller.queried the girl, twisting around and
looking at the name on the door to make certain."Yes," replied the genial doctor, with growing interest.He was a
gray-haired, elderly man, slightly inclined to embonpoint, and with
keen, twinkling eyes."Yes, indeed," returned the girl; "I'd love to."Most everybody seems to have heard of me," sighed the girl."Well, it
doesn't make any difference about my coming in here, does it?"She
looked up at him so wistfully that he felt a great tug at his
heartstrings."You're as welcome as the April
sun.""Now tell me," she said eagerly,
looking about."That," said he, taking up the pulpy gray object, "is the brain of my
erstwhile friend and collaborator, Doctor Bolton.murmured Carmen, a facetious twinkle coming into
her eyes as she looked at it."In the interests of science," returned the man, studying her."That
we may increase our knowledge of this marvelous mechanism of thought,
and the laws by which it operates in mental processes.""Then you still blindly seek the living among the dead, don't you?""You think that this poor thing held life, and you
search now among its ashes for the living principle.But, God is life;
and 'Canst thou by searching find out God?'"The man regarded her intently without replying.She bent for a while
over the half-dissected brain in deep thought."Doctor," she said, "life is not structural.God is life; and to know
Him is to reflect life.Doctor, don't
you think it is about time to do away with this business of dying?"The man of science started visibly, and his eyes opened wider.The
abrupt question quite swept him off his feet."You didn't really expect to find anything in this brain, did you?""Why, mostly water, with a few commonplace salts," he answered,
wondering what the next question would be."And can a compound of water and a few commonplace salts _think_?"she
asked, looking intently at him."N--no," he answered tentatively."The brain is not the cause of thought, then, but an effect, is it
not?""Why, really, my dear Miss Carmen, we don't know.We call it the organ
of thought, because in some way thought seems to be associated with
it, rather than with--well, with the liver, or muscles, for example.And we learn that certain classes of mental disturbances are
intimately associated with lesions or clots in the brain.Then:

"Doctor, you wouldn't cut up a machine to discover the motive power,
would you?But that is just what you are doing there with that brain.You are hoping by dissecting it to find the power that made it go,
aren't you?And the power that made it go was mind--life.""But the life is not in the brain now," hazarded the doctor."You see," she went on, "if
the brain was ever alive, it could never cease to be so.If it ever
lived, it could never die.It
manifested only a false sense of life.Who
or what says that the man who owned that brain is dead?Why, the human
mind--human belief.It is the human mind, expressing its belief in
death, and in a real opposite to life, or God.She returned his look
with a confident smile."You believe in evolution, don't you?""Oh, surely," he replied unhesitatingly."Well, then, in the process of evolution, which was evolved first, the
brain, or the mind which operates it and through it?""Why," he replied meditatively, "it is quite likely that they evolved
simultaneously, the brain being the mind's organ of expression.""But don't you see, Doctor, that you are now making the mind really
come first?For that which expresses a thing is always secondary to
the thing expressed.""At any rate, it is quite immaterial to a
practical knowledge of how to meet the brain's ills.I am a practical
man, you know.""I'm sorry to hear that," she said simply."Practical men are so
stupid and ignorant."he exclaimed, putting his hands on his hips and
staring down at the smiling face."And you are so nice and friendly, I wouldn't want to think you stupid
and ignorant," she went on blandly.Well, that kind o' takes the edge off your former classification
of me," he said, greatly amused, yet wondering just what appraisal to
place upon this frank girl."And evolution," she continued, "is an unfolding, isn't it?You see,
the great fact of creation is the creator, infinite mind.Well, that
mind expresses itself in its ideas.And these it is unfolding all the
time.Now a fact always gives rise to a suppositional opposite.The
opposite of a fact is an error.And that is why error has been called
'negative truth.'Of course, there isn't any such thing as negative
truth!And so all error is simply falsity, supposition, without real
existence."Now, the human, or
carnal, mind is the negative truth of the real mind, God.It is
infinite mind's suppositional opposite.And it imitates the
infinite mind, but in a very stupid, blundering way.And so the whole
physical universe manifests evolution, too--an unfolding, or
revealing, of material types, or mental concepts.And all these
manifest the human mind's sense of life, and its equally strong
sense of death.The universe, animals, men, are all human types,
evolved, or unfolded, or revealed, in the human mind.And all are
the human mind's interpretations of infinite mind's real and eternal
and perfect ideas."You know," she laughed, "speaking of 'negative truth', the first
chapter of Genesis sets forth positive truth, and the second chapter
sets forth its opposite, negative truth.But
there it is for everybody to read.And the human mind, of course, true
to its beliefs, clings to the second chapter as the reality.Meantime, Carmen's attention had been attracted to a large microscope
that stood on the table near her.Going to it, she peeped curiously
down into the tube.Well," she suddenly asked, "have
you got the fear germ here?"But when the girl looked up, her face was quite
serious."You do not know it, Doctor, for you are a practical man, but you
haven't anything but fear germs under this glass," she said in a low
voice."Why, those are germs of typhoid and tuberculosis!""And manifestations, externalizations, of the fear germ itself, which
is mental," she added."These things don't cause disease," she went
on, pointing to the slide.Do you scientists know why people die, Doctor?""We really do not know why people die.""Then I'll tell you," she said."_It's because they don't know enough
to live._ This poor Doctor Bolton died because he didn't know that God
was life.He committed sickness, and then paid the penalty, death.He
sinned by believing that there were other powers than God, by
believing that life and thought were in matter.And so he paid the
wages of sin, death.He simply missed the mark, that's all.""You haven't asked me
to sit down," she commented brightly."But, if you don't mind, I
will."the doctor exclaimed, coloring, and hastily
setting out a chair."I really was so interested in what you were
saying that I forgot my manners.""No," she said, shaking her head as she declined the proffered chair,
"I'll sit here, so's I can look straight into your eyes.You go ahead
and cut up poor Yorick, and I'll talk.""You are much more interesting," he
returned, "than poor Bolton, dead or alive.In fact, he really was
quite a bore.But you are like a sparkling mountain rill, even if you
do give me a severe classification.""Well," she replied, "then you are honestly more interested in life
than in death, are you?"Death is _such_ a mistake; and I haven't a bit of use
for it," she continued."It's like making mistakes in music, or
mathematics.Now when we make mistakes in those, we never stop to
discuss them.The world has nearly
talked its poor old head off about the mistakes of sickness and death.It never seems to occur to the world that Jesus always associated
sickness with sin.You know, the Rabbis of his day seem to have hit
upon a great truth, although they didn't make it really practical.They maintained that a sick man could not be healed of his diseases
until all his sins had been forgiven.And so they attempted to forgive
sins and make men clean by their elaborate ceremonies.And nobody got to the root of the difficulty until
Jesus came.And that cured
the disease that was the manifestation of sin.Now I ask, why do you,
nearly two thousand years after his time, still do as the old Rabbis
did, and continue to treat the body--the effect--instead of the mental
cause?But," looking down in meditation, "I suppose if you did that
the people would cry, 'He hath a devil!'They thought I was a witch in
Simiti.""Then you do not believe that disease is
caused by microbes, I take it?"It is a
manifestation of the human mind again.And, as with typhoid fever,
diphtheria, and other diseases, the human mind applies its own
cherished, ignorant beliefs in certain methods, and then renders
innocuous its own manifestations, microbes.The human mind makes its
own diseases, and then in some cases removes the disease, but still by
human, material methods.At last it
yields itself to its false beliefs, and then goes out in what it calls
death.It is all a mental process--all human thought and its various
manifestations.Now why not get beyond microbes and reach the cause,
even of them, the human mind itself?Why do not you men of science do likewise?"Doctor Morton himself took the chair which he had set out for the
girl."What you say," he replied slowly, "is not new to me.But I can
only answer that the world is not ready yet for the great change which
you suggest."What mesmerism you are laboring
under!"Well, then, would he be accepted to-day, if he had not come before?""And I quite agree with you," she said firmly."Now the world has
doctored for more than four thousand years, despite the fact that
health is not sold in bottle or pill form.Doctor, what does the
history of all these centuries of drugging show you?"Carmen waited a moment; then continued:

"Don't they demonstrate the absolute inability of medicines to cure
disease?""Any more than putting men in prison cures
crime?""They at least prove that medication has not _permanently_ removed
disease," he ventured, not wishing to go too far."Doctor," she said earnestly, "that man Jesus, who, according to you,
came too soon, said: 'Without me ye can do nothing.'Well, didn't he
come very, very close to the truth when he made that statement?He did
not say that without drugs or material remedies we could do nothing,
but that without the Christ-principle mankind would continue, as
before, to miss the mark.He showed that disease and discord result
from sin.Sin is lack of righteousness, lack of right-thinking about
things.Its effect,
disease, is mental--a state of discordant consciousness.Can you with
drugs change a state of mind?""Whiskey and opium cause changes in
one's state of mind.""But the human belief of power inherent in whiskey
and opium, or of the human body's reaction to them, causes a change in
the human thought-activity that is called consciousness.The state of
human consciousness changes with the belief, but not the real state of
mind.And Doctor Bolton--"

"Bolton was not sick.He died of natural causes, old age, and general
breakdown," was the doctor's refuge.Carmen laughed and sprang down from the table."What an obstinately
obdurate lot you scientific men are!""Don't you know
that you doctors are only a development of the old'medicine-man'?Bolton isn't dead; and, in the second, there
are no _natural_ causes of death.Why, that's gone out of
fashion, long since.""Then," with a note of banter in his voice, "I take it that you do not
expect to die.""I expect good, nothing but
good, ever!Don't you know that physiologists themselves admit that
the human body is composed of eighty-five per cent water and fifteen
per cent ordinary salts?Can such a combination have intelligence and
sensation?Do you still believe that life is dependent upon lungs,
stomach, or liver?Why, the so-called 'unit cell' breathes, digests,
and manifests life-functions, and yet it has no lungs, no mouth, no
stomach, no organs.It is the human mind, assuming knowledge and power
which it does _not_ possess, that says the sense of life shall depend
upon such organs in the one case and not in the other.And the human
mind could be utterly refuted if men would only learn to use the
Christ-principle.Jesus and Paul used it, and proved material laws to
be only false beliefs.""Well," he replied meditatively, "if you are correct, then the
preachers are way off the track.And I have long since come to the
conclusion that--Well," changing abruptly back to the previous topic,
"so you refute the microbe theory, eh?""I said I did and did not," she laughed."Listen: fear, worry, hatred,
malice, murder, all of which are mental things in themselves, manifest
to the human mind as microbes.These are the hurtful microbes, and
they produce toxins, which poison the system.It is
the Christ-principle.Now you can learn that principle, and how to
apply it.But if you don't care to, why, then you must go on with your
material microbes and poisons, and with your diseases and death, until
you are ready to leave them and turn to that which is real.For all
human-mind activity and manifestation, whether in microbes, death, or
life, is mental, and is but the counterfeit of the real activity of
divine mind, God."Do you know," she pursued earnestly, "I heard a lecture the other day
in which it was said that life is a sort of fermentation in the body.Well, as regards human life, I guess that is so.For the human body is
only a manifestation of the human mind; and the human mind surely is
in a continuous state of ferment!""The lecturer," she continued, "said that the
range of life was from ultra-microbe to man, and that Shakespeare
began as a single cell.The mundane concept of
Shakespeare's body may have unfolded from a cell-concept; but
Shakespeare was a manifestation of mind!And that mind was an
interpretation, though very imperfect, of the mind that is God.Why
can't you materialists raise your eyes above the dust?Why, you would
choke the very avenues of the spirit with mud!"Well, your education seems to be--"

"Yes," she interrupted, "my education is beyond the vagaries that are
so generally taught in the name of knowledge.It does nothing for mankind, except to give them a false
culture.Were the so-called great men of the past really educated?Here is an extract which I copied this afternoon from Hawthorne."She
opened her note book and read:

  "'Ah, but there is a half-acknowledged melancholy like to this
  when we stand in the perfected vigor of our life and feel that
  Time has now given us all his flowers, and that the next work of
  his never-idle fingers must be to steal them one by one away.'"Now," she asked, "was that man really educated?But that theology _could not solve his least earthly problem, nor
meet his slightest need_!Oh, what inexpressibly sad lives so many of
your greatest men have lived!Your Hawthorne, your Longfellow, they
yearned for the rest which they were taught was to follow death.If they
believed in the Christ--and they thought they did--why, then, did they
not rise up and do as he bade them do, put death out?He taught no
such resignation to human beliefs as they practiced!He showed men how
to overcome the world.He looked at her intently for some moments.She seemed, as she stood
there before him, like a thing of gossamer and sunshine that had
drifted into his laboratory, despite the closed door."Say," he suddenly exclaimed, as a new thought struck him, "I'd like
to have you talk with my friend, Reverend Patterson Moore!Pat and I
have barked at each other for many years now, and I'm getting tired.I'd like to shift him to a younger and more vigorous opponent.I
believe you've been providentially sent to relieve me.""You can tell Professor Hitt, and--"

"Hitt, eh?He is very much interested
in these things that you and I have been talking about to-day.We have
regular meetings, with Father Waite, and Mr.Haynerd, and--"

"Well, no wonder you can argue!But--suppose I have Hitt bring me to one of your meetings, eh?"The genial doctor laughed long and incontinently."I imagine Reverend
Pat wouldn't thank you for referring to him that way," he said."He is
a very high Anglican, and his dignity is marvelous--to say nothing of
his self-esteem.Well, we'll see, we'll see."I didn't really mean to come in here, you
know.But I guess I was led, don't you?"And when the door had closed upon her, the doctor sat silently beside
the pulseless brain of his deceased comrade and pondered long.*       *       *       *       *

When Carmen entered the house, late that afternoon, she found the
Beaubien in conversation with Professor Williams, of the University
School of Music.That gentleman had learned through Hitt of the girl's
unusual voice, and had dropped in on his way home to ask that he might
hear and test it.With only a smile for reply, Carmen tossed her books
and hat upon the sofa and went directly to the piano, where she
launched into the weird Indian lament which had produced such an
astounding effect upon her chance visitors at the Elwin school that
day long gone, and which had been running in her thought and seeking
expression ever since her conversation with Doctor Morton a short
while before.For a full half hour she sang, lost in the harmony that poured from
her soul.Father Waite entered, and quietly took a seat.Song after song, most of them the characteristic soft
melodies of her people, and many her own simple improvisations, issued
from the absorbed girl's lips.The Beaubien rose and stole softly from
the room.Father Waite sat with his head resting on his hand, striving
to interpret the message which welled from the depths of his own
being, where hidden, unused chords were vibrating in unison with those
of this young girl.Then, abruptly, the singing stopped, and Carmen turned and faced her
auditors."There," she said, with a happy sigh, "that just _had_ to
come out!""Who, may I ask, was your
teacher?"he said, in a voice husky with emotion.A look of astonishment came into the man's face.He turned to Father
Waite inquiringly.The latter nodded his confirmation of the girl's
words."I wonder if you realize what you
have got, Miss Carmen?""It's a beautiful gift, isn't it?""But--I had thought of asking you to let me train you--but--I--I dare
not undertake to handle such a voice as yours.May I--may I send
Maitre Rossanni to you, the great Italian?"Oh, yes," returned the girl; "I'll sing for anybody.The gift isn't
mine, you know.When the professor had taken his reluctant departure, the Beaubien
returned and handed Carmen a letter.With a cry of joy the girl seized
it and tore it open.It was from Colombia, the second one that her
beloved Rosendo had succeeded in getting down the river to the distant
coast.It had been written three months prior, and it bore many stains
and evidences of the vicissitudes through which it had emerged.Yes,
Rosendo and his family were well, though still at Maria Rosa, far up
the Boque, with Don Nicolas.The war raged below them, but they were
safe."And not a word from Padre Jose, or about him," murmured the girl,
sinking into a chair and clasping the soiled letter to her breast.Father Waite thought of the little newsboy of Cartagena, and his
possible share in the cause of Jose's silence.CHAPTER 4


Carmen's first serious test of her knowledge of English composition
was made early in the semester, in an essay on town life in Colombia;
and so meritorious did her instructor consider it that he advised her
to send it to a prominent literary magazine.The result was that the
essay was accepted, and a request made for further contributions.The girl bubbled with new-found happiness.Then she wrote another, and
still another article on the life and customs of her people.Both
were given publication; and with the money which she received for them
she bought a silk dress for Jude, much to that adoring woman's
surprise and vehement protest.Carmen might have saved the money
toward a piano--but, no; that would have been thinking of herself, and
was inadmissible.Nor did the Beaubien offer any objection."Indeed,"
commented that fond shepherd of this lone lamb, "she would have poured
the money out into somebody's open hand anyway, and it might as well
be Jude's."Then she choked back the tears as she added: "The girl comes home
every night with an empty purse, no matter how full it may have been
in the morning.Carmen's slight success in the field of letters still further aroused
Haynerd's interest.The peacefully somnolent Social Era, he thought,
might awaken to new things under the stimulus of such fresh writing as
hers.Perhaps life did hold something of real value after all.Would
she furnish him with a column or two on the peculiar social aspect of
the metropolis?And the result was that the staid conservative
sheet was given a smart shaking; and several prominent society people
sat up and blinked.It but threw a clear light from a somewhat unusual
angle upon certain phases of New York's social life, and uncovered a
few of the more subtly hidden springs of its peculiar activity.Among those who read her essay in the Social Era was J. Wilton Ames.He first lay back in his chair and laughed uproariously.And then,
when his agents discovered for him the identity of the author, he
glowered.The Beaubien was still standing between him and this budding
genius.And though he might, and would, ultimately ruin the Beaubien
financially, yet this girl, despite her social ostracism, bade fair to
earn with her facile pen enough to maintain them both in luxury.So he
bent anew to his vengeful schemes, for he would make them come to him.As Trustee, he would learn what courses the girl was pursuing in the
University--for he had long known that she was in attendance there.Then he would learn who her associates were; what suggestions and
advice her instructors gave her; and her plans for the future.And he
would trace her sources of income and apply pressure at the most vital
point.He had never in his life been successfully balked.Then Haynerd came to congratulate Carmen again, and to request that
she attend with him the formal opening of the new Ames mansion, the
great Fifth Avenue palace, for he wanted her vivid, first-hand
impressions for his account of the brilliant affair in the Social Era.As reporters, he explained, they would of necessity remain in
seclusion, and the girl might disguise to such an extent as to prevent
recognition, if she chose.It was business for him, and an opportunity
for rich experience for her.And the fearless girl went, because it
would help Haynerd, though the Beaubien inwardly trembled.Invitations to the number of three hundred had been issued to the
_elite_ of New York, announcing the formal opening of the newly
finished, magnificent Ames dwelling.These invitations were wrought in
enamel on cards of pure gold.A month prior to the opening, the
newspapers had printed carefully-worded announcements of the return of
Mrs.J. Wilton Ames and her daughter, after a protracted stay at
various foreign baths and rest-cures in the hope of restoring the
former's impaired health.Ames now felt that she could no
longer deprive society of her needed activities, and so had returned
to conduct it through what promised to be a season of unusual
brilliancy.The papers did not, however, state that J. Wilton had
himself recalled her, after quietly destroying his bill of divorce,
because he recognized the necessity of maintaining the social side of
his complicated existence on a par with his vast business affairs.As Carmen and Haynerd approached the huge, white marble structure,
cupolaed, gabled, buttressed, and pinnacled, an overwhelming sense of
what it stood for suddenly came upon the girl, and she saw revealed in
a flash that side of its owner's life which for so many months she had
been pondering.The great shadows that seemed to issue from the
massive exterior of the building swept out and engulfed her; and she
turned and clasped Haynerd's arm with the feeling that she would
suffocate were she to remain longer in them."Perk up, little one," said Haynerd, taking her hand."We'll go round
to the rear entrance, and I will present my business card there.Ames's secretary telephoned me instructions, and I said I was going to
bring a lady reporter with me."Carmen caught her breath as she passed through the tall, exquisitely
wrought iron gateway and along the marble walk which led to the rear.Up the winding steps to the front entrance, where swung the marvelous
bronze doors which had stirred the imaginations of two continents,
streamed the favored of the fashionable world.Among them Carmen saw
many whom she recognized.The buffoon, Larry Beers, was there,
swinging jauntily along with the bejeweled wife of Samson, the
multimillionaire packer.Kane and his wife, and Weston followed.Outside the gates there was incessant chugging of automobiles, mingled
with the shouted orders of the three policemen detailed to direct the
traffic.A pinched, ragged urchin and his tattered little sister crept
up and peered wildly through the iron pickets of the fence; but a
sharp rap from a policeman's club sent them scattering.Carmen stood
for a moment in the shadows and watched the swarm mount the marble
steps and enter through those wonderful doors.There were congressmen
and senators, magnates and jurists, distillers and preachers.Each one
owed his tithe of allegiance to Ames.Some were chained to him hard
and fast, nor would break their bonds this side of the grave.There were those who grew white under his most casual
glance.There were others who knew that his calloused hand was closing
about them, and that when it opened again they would fall to the
ground, dry as dust.Others, like moths, not yet singed, were hovering
ever closer to the bright, cruel flame.Reverend Darius Borwell,
bowing and smiling, alighted from his parochial car and tripped
blithely up the glistening marble steps.Each and all, wrapping the
skeleton of grief, greed, shame, or fear beneath swart broadcloth and
shimmering silk, floated up those ghostly steps as if drawn by a
tremendous magnet incarnate in the person of J. Wilton Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away.Hawley-Crowles sigh in the wake of that gilded assembly?Did the moans
of poor, grief-stricken Mrs.Gannette, sitting in her poverty and
sorrow, die into silence against those bronze doors?Was he, the being
who dwelt in that marble palace, the hydra-headed embodiment of the
carnal, Scriptural, age-old power that opposes God?How many others there were
scattered through the house itself, Haynerd could only guess.But he
passed inspection and was admitted with the girl.A butler took
immediate charge of them, and led them quickly through a short passage
and to an elevator, by which they mounted to another floor, where,
opening a paneled oak door, the dignified functionary preceded them
into a small reception hall, with lavatories at either end.Here he
bade them remove their wraps and await his return."Well," commented Haynerd, with a light, nervous laugh, "we've crossed
the Rubicon!A moment later the butler returned with a sharp-eyed young woman, Mrs."You will be very careful in your report," the latter began at once in
a business-like manner."And you will submit the same to me for
approval before it is published in your magazine.Ames deems that
imperative, since your recent publication of an essay on modern
society in this city.I have a list here of the guests, their business
and social standing, and other data.You
will say that this is the most brilliant assemblage ever gathered
under one roof in New York.The wealth represented here to-night will
total not less than three billion dollars.The jewels alone displayed
will foot up not less than twenty millions.Now, let me see," again
consulting her notes.Haynerd stole a covert glance at Carmen and winked."The chef," the secretary resumed, "was brought over from Paris by
Mrs.His name, Pierre Lotard, descendant of
the famous chef of the Emperor Napoleon First.He considers that his
menu to-night surpasses anything he ever before achieved.""May I ask," interrupted Haynerd, "the probable cost of the supper?""Yes, perhaps you had better mention that item.It will be in the
neighborhood of three hundred dollars a plate.House and table
decorations, about eight thousand dollars.The menu cards were hand-illuminated by Parisian
artists, and each bears a sketch illustrative or suggestive of the
guest to whom it is given.""Three thousand, if I correctly recall it," was the nonchalant reply."As to the viands, you will mention that they have been gathered from
every part of the world.Now come with me, and I will give you a hasty
sketch of the house, while the guests are assembling in the grand
salon.Then you will remain in the balcony, where you will make what
notes you wish on the dress displayed.Refreshments will be served to
you later in this waiting room.I need not remind you that you are not
expected to mingle with the guests, nor to address any one.Keep to
the balcony, and quite out of view."Opening a door opposite the one through which she had entered, the
young woman led her charges directly out upon the great marble balcony
overlooking the grand salon below.A rush of brilliant light engulfed
them, and a potpourri of chatter and laughter, mingled with soft music
from a distant organ, and the less distinct notes of the orchestra in
the still more distant ballroom, rose about them in confused babel, as
they tiptoed to the exquisitely carved marble railing and peered down
upon the gorgeous pageant.The ceiling rose far above them, delicately
tinted like a soft Italian sky.The lofty walls dropped, like
gold-gray veils, to the richly carved paneled wainscoting beneath,
which had once lined the halls of a mediaeval castle on the Rhine.The
great windows were hidden behind rare Venetian lace curtains, over
which fell hangings of brocade, repeating the soft tints of the wall
and the brocade-covered chairs and divans ranged close about the sides
of the splendid room.On the floor lay a massive, priceless Persian
carpet, dating from the fifteenth century.Haynerd drew a long breath, and whistled softly.From the end of the
salon he could mark the short flight of steps which led to the
mezzanine, with its walls heavily tapestried, and broken by rich oak
doors opening into lavatories and lounging rooms, itself widening at
the far end into the grand billiard and smoking parlors, done off in
Circassian walnut, with tables and furniture to harmonize.From the
mezzanine he saw the grand stairway falling away in great, sweeping
curves, all in blended marble from the world's greatest quarries, and
delicately chased and carved into classic designs.Two tapestries,
centuries old, hung from the walls on either side.Far above, the oak
ceiling, for which the _Schwarzwald_ had been ranged, was overlaid
with pure gold leaf.The whole was suffused with the glow of myriad
hidden and inverted lights, reflected in a thousand angles from
burnished gold and marble and rarest gems.He groped in the chambers of
his imagery for some superlative adjective to express his emotion
before this colossal display of wealth.But his ample vocabulary had
faded quite.He could only shake his head and give vent to the inept
remark, "Swell--by George!"The secretary, without replying, motioned them to follow.Passing
noiselessly around the balcony to the opposite side, she indicated a
door below, leading off to the right from the grand salon."That room beyond," she said, "is the petit salon.It is
in panels from French chateaux, covered with Gobelin tapestry.Now
from here you can see a bit of the music room.The grand organ cost,
installed, about two hundred thousand dollars.It is electrically
controlled, with its pipes running all around the room, so as to give
the effect of music coming from every corner.""There are three art galleries beyond, two for paintings, and one for
sculpture.Ames has without doubt the finest art collection in
America.It includes several Titians, Veroneses, da Vincis, Turners,
three Rubens, and two Raphaels.By the way, it may interest you to
know that his negotiations for the Murillo Madonna were completed
to-day, and the picture will be sent to him immediately.""Might I ask what he paid for it?""You may say that he paid something over three hundred thousand
dollars for it," she replied, in a quite matter of fact tone."Now,"
she continued, "you will go back to your first position, near the door
of the waiting room, and remain there until I return.I may have an
opportunity later to show you the library.Great
carved stone fireplace, taken from a Scotch castle.Hundreds of rare
volumes and first editions.Now, if any one approaches, you can step
behind the screen and remain out of view.You have chairs and a table
there for your writing.With this final injunction she turned and disappeared into the little
waiting room from which they had emerged.For some moments Carmen and Haynerd stood looking alternately at
each other and about them at their magnificent environment.Both had
seen much of the gilded life, and the girl had dwelt some months in
its alien atmosphere.But neither had ever witnessed such a
stupendous display of material wealth as was here unfolded before
their astonished gaze.At the head of the grand stairway stood the
Ames trio, to receive their resplendent guests.The women were
magnificently gowned.But Ames's massive form in its simple black
and chaste linen was the cynosure of all eyes.Even Haynerd could
not suppress a note of admiration as he gazed at the splendid figure."And yet," he murmured, "a victim, like the rest, of the great
delusion."Carmen laid down the opera glasses through which she had been studying
the man."He is an expression," she said, "of the American ideal--the
ideal of practical material life.It is toward his plane of life that
this country's youth are struggling, at, oh, what a cost!Think,
think, what his immense, misused revenue could do, if unselfishly
used!Why, the cost of this single night's show would put two hundred
men like Father Waite through a four-year course in the University,
and train them to do life's work!"Oh, further opportunities to increase his pile, I suppose," returned
Haynerd, shrugging his shoulders.And does he need further
opportunities to accumulate money?Does he not rather need some one to
show him the meaning of life, how to really live?"And it may be your mission, Carmen, to do just that.But if you don't, then I sincerely hope the man may die before he
discovers that all that he has achieved, his wealth, his prestige, his
power, have not been worth striving for!""He hasn't the slightest idea of the meaning of life," she murmured,
looking down upon the glittering throng."They put me in mind of Carlyle's famous remark, as
he stood looking out across the London Strand: 'There are in this city
some four million people, mostly fools.'How mean, narrow and hard
their lives are!These are the high priests of vested privilege, of
mediaevalism, of old institutions whose perpetual maintenance, even in
a generation that has progressed far beyond them, is a fungus blight
upon us.Ah, there's little Willie Van Wot, all dolled out!He's
glorifying his Creator now by devoting his foolish little existence to
coaching trips along the New England shore.He reminds me of the Fleet
street poet who wrote a century ago of the similar occupation of a
young dandy of that day--

                  What can little T. O. do?Why, drive a Phaeton and Two!!!Can little T. O. do no more?Yes, drive a Phaeton and Four!!!!"He's an interesting outgrowth of our unique social system, eh?""We must follow Emerson and treat them all as we do pictures, look at
them in the best light," murmured Carmen."Aye, hang them in the best light!""But make sure
they're well hung!There goes the pseudo-princess, member of the royal
house of England.I tell you, under
the splash and glitter you can see the feet of clay, eh?""Yes," smiled Carmen, "resting upon the high heel."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture of disgust."The women of
fashion seem to feel that the Creator didn't do a good job when He
designed the feminine sex--that He should have put a hump where the
heel is, so's to slant the foot and make comfortable walking
impossible, as well as to insure a plentiful crop of foot-troubles and
deformities.The Chinese women used to manifest a similarly insane
thought.The human mind is a cave
of black ignorance!"Carmen did not reply, but bent her attention again to the throng
below."Look there," said Haynerd, indicating a stout, full-toiletted woman,
resplendent with diamonds."That's our eminent French guest, Madam
Carot.She severed herself from her tiresome consort last year by
means of a bichloride tablet deftly immersed in his coffee, and then,
leaving a sigh of regret hovering over his unhandsome remains,
hastened to our friendly shores, to grace the _beau monde_ with her
gowns and jewels."Carmen turned to him with a remonstrance of incredulity."The Social Era got the whole spicy
story.See, she's drifted up to young Watson!Coquetting for a
husband still, the old buzzard!""Well, it's fact, anyway," persisted the society monitor."And there
beyond her is fat little Mrs.Stuffenheimer, with her two unlovely,
red-faced daughters.Ah, the despairing mamma is still vainly angling
for mates for her two chubby Venuses!If they're not married off
properly and into good social positions soon, it's mamma for the scrap
heap!it's positively tragic to see these anxious mothers
at Newport and Atlantic City and other fashionable places, rushing
madly hither and yon with their marriageable daughters, dragging them
from one function to another in the wild hope that they may ultimately
land a man.Worry and pain dig deep furrows into poor mamma's face if
she sees her daughters fading into the has-been class.It requires
heroism, I say, to travel in society!Well,"
taking up his notebook, "we must get busy now.By the way, how's your
shorthand progressing?""Oh, splendidly," replied the girl, her eyes still upon the massive
figure of Ames.Then, recovering from her abstraction, "I can write as
fast in it now as in longhand."For more than an hour the two sat in the seclusion of the splendid
balcony, looking down upon the scene of magnificence below.Through
the mind of the young girl ran a ceaseless paean of thanksgiving for
her timely deliverance from the trammels which she so well knew
enshackled these glittering birds of paradise.With it mingled a
great, consuming desire, a soul-longing to pour into the vacuity of
high society the leaven of her own pure thought.In particular did her
boundless love now go out to that gigantic figure whose ideals of life
this sumptuous display of material wealth and power expressed.Was it only a vainglorious
exhibition of his own human prowess?Was it an announcement,
magnificent beyond compare, that he, J. Wilton Ames, had attained the
supreme heights of gratified world ambition?That the world at last
lay at his feet?And that over it brooded the giant's lament that
there remained nothing more to conquer?But, if so, the girl at least
knew that the man's herculean efforts to subdue the material world
were as nothing.The real conquest lay still before him, the conquest
of self.And when that were faced and achieved, well she knew that no
such garish display as this would announce the victory to a breathless
world.The bustling little social secretary again appeared, and briefly
announced the production of an opera in the auditorium, to which she
had come to conduct them.Passing through the little waiting room and
to the elevator, they quickly mounted to the unoccupied gallery of the
theater above.The parquet, which would seat nearly a thousand
spectators, was rapidly filling with an eager, curious throng.The
Ames trio and some of the more distinguished guests were already
occupying the gorgeously decorated boxes at the sides.An orchestra of
fifty pieces was visible in the hollow below the stage.Caroni, the
famous grand opera leader, stood ready to conduct.The opera itself
was the much discussed music drama, Salome."Now," commented Haynerd to his fair, wondering companion, who was
lost in contemplation of the magnificent mural decorations of the
little theater, "we will see something rare, for this opera has been
called the most artistic piece of indecency known to the stage.Ames has got Marie Deschamps for the title role.She'll cost
him not less than five thousand dollars for this one night.And--see
here," drawing Carmen's attention to the bill, "Marcou and Corvalle
besides!These stars get three thousand
dollars a night during the regular season."Every phase of sophistication was manifested in that glittering
audience when the curtain rose and the sensational theme was
introduced.But to none came thoughts like those which clamored for
admittance at the portals of Carmen's mentality.In the bold challenge
of the insanely sensual portrayal of a carnal mind the girl saw the
age-old defiance of the spirit by the flesh.In the rolls of the
wondrous music, in its shrieks, its pleadings, and its dying echoes,
she heard voiced again the soul-lament of a weary world searching
vainly in the mazes of human thought for truth.As the wonderful
Deschamps danced weirdly before her in the ghastly light and fell
gloating over her gory trophy, Carmen saw but the frantic struggles of
a diseased soul, portrayed as the skilled surgeon lays bare the
malignant growth that is eating the quivering tissues of a human
frame.The immodesty of dress, the sensual suggestiveness of the
dance, the brutal flouting of every element of refinement and
delicacy, blazoned in frenzied tone and movement the bloody orgy and
dance of death which goes on incessantly upon the stage of human life,
and ends in the mad whirl and confusion and insane gibbering over the
lifeless trophies for which mankind sell their very souls.commented Haynerd, when the final
curtain dropped."Yes, even to a vitiated taste.The passionate thirst
for the sensational has led to this sickening display of salacity--"

"Splendid, wasn't it?"came in tones of admiration from the social
secretary, who had returned to conduct her charges back to the balcony
before the guests emerged from the theater."You will run the program
in full, and comment at some length on the expense attached," she went
on."You have just witnessed the private production of a full opera,
unabridged, and with the regular operatic cast.Supper will follow in
a half hour.Meantime, you will remain in the balcony where you were
before."Returning to their former position, Carmen sank into a chair at the
little table behind the screen, and strove to orient her thought.Haynerd sat down beside her to arrange his voluminous notes.Presently
footsteps were heard, and the sound of voices.Haynerd glanced through
the hinge of the screen.he whispered, "here comes Ames
and--who's with him?Showing him about, I
suppose."Carmen gazed at the approaching men with fascinated eyes, although she
saw but one, the towering magician who had reared this fairy palace.She saw Ames lead his companion to the door of the little waiting room
at their right, and heard the congressman protest against entering."But we can talk undisturbed in here," urged Ames, his hand on the
door."Better remain out here on the balcony," replied the congressman
nervously, as he moved toward the railing.He understood the
man's repugnance fully."You know, Wales," he said easily, going to the railing and peering
over at the brilliant assemblage below, "if I could get the heathen
Chinee to add an extra half-inch to his shirt length, I'd make a
hundred millions.And then, perhaps, I wouldn't need to struggle with
your Ways and Means Committee as I do.By the way, the cotton schedule
will be reported out unchanged, I presume."He turned and looked
quizzically at his companion as he said this.Wales trembled slightly when he replied to the question he had been
awaiting."Parsons will vote for it," he said
suggestively.Ames, is committed to
the high tariff principle.We can not let in a flood of foreign
cotton--"

"Then you want the fight between the farmers and spinners to continue,
eh?""You don't seem to realize that in the
end both will get more money than they are getting now, and that it
will come from the consumer, who will pay vastly higher for his
finished products, in addition to the tariff.Ames," returned the congressman
tenaciously."Look here, Wales," said Ames, turning savagely upon his companion.Their
cooeperative associations must be smashed.The tariff schedule which
you have before your Committee will do it.Ames," replied the congressman, "I--I am opposed to the constant
manipulation of cotton by you rich men.I--"

"There," interrupted Ames, "never mind explaining your conscientious
scruples.What I want to know is, do you intend to cast your vote for
the unaltered schedule?"Ames, I can't--"

"H'm," murmured Ames.Then, with easy nonchalance, turning to an
apparently irrelevant topic as he gazed over the railing, "I heard
just before coming from my office this evening that the doors of the
Mercantile Trust would not open to-morrow.A lot of my
personal friends are heavily involved.Ames and Company will take over their tangible assets; I believe
you were interested, were you not?"He glanced at the trembling man
out of the corners of his eyes.His hands shook as he grasped the railing before
him and tried to steady himself."It--it--yes--very hard," murmured the dazed man.But step into the waiting room and 'phone the newspapers.Representative Wales was serving his first term in Congress.His
election had been a matter of surprise to everybody, himself included,
excepting Ames.Wales knew not that his detailed personal history had
been for many months carefully filed in the vaults of the Ames tower.Nor did he ever suspect that his candidacy and election had been
matters of most careful thought on the part of the great financier
and his political associates.But when he, a stranger to congressional
halls, was made a member of the Ways and Means Committee, his
astonishment overleaped all bounds.Then Ames had smiled his own
gratification, and arranged that the new member should attend the
formal opening of the great Ames palace later in the year.Meantime,
the financier and the new congressman had met on several occasions,
and the latter had felt no little pride in the attention which the
great man had shown him.And so the path to fame had unrolled steadily before the guileless
Wales until this night, when the first suspicions of his thraldom had
penetrated and darkened his thought.Then, like a crash from a clear
sky, had come the announcement of the Mercantile Trust failure.And as
he stood there now, clutching the marble railing, his thought busy
with the woman and the two fair children who would be rendered
penniless by this blow, the fell presence of the monster Ames seemed
to bend over him as the epitome of ruthless, brutal, inhuman cunning."How much are you likely to lose by this failure?""Not less than fifty thousand
dollars," he replied in a husky voice.stooping and apparently taking up an object that had
been lying on the floor back of the congressman.Wales took the book in a dazed, mechanical way."Why--I have no--this
is not mine," he murmured, gazing alternately at the pass book and at
Ames."Your name's on it, at least," commented Ames laconically."And the
book's been issued by our bank, Ames and Company.Guess you've
forgotten opening an account there, let me see, yes, a week ago."He
took the book and opened it."Ah, yes, I recall the incident now.The book, made out in his name on Ames
and Company, showed a deposit to his credit of fifty thousand
dollars!Ames slipped his arm through the confused congressman's, and started
with him down the balcony."You see," he said, as they moved away,
"the Mercantile failure will not hit you as hard as you thought.Now,
about that cotton schedule, when you cast your vote for it, be sure
that--" The voice died away as the men disappeared in the distance,
leaving Carmen and Haynerd staring blankly at each other."We must save them both," said Carmen quietly."I could make my everlasting fortune out of this!"exclaimed Haynerd
excitedly."And lose your soul," replied the girl.Ames, and
tell him that we overheard his conversation.Haynerd then smiled, but it was a hard smile, coming from one who knew
the world."Listen, my dear girl," he said, "we will keep quiet, you
and I. To mention this would be only to court disaster at the hands of
one who would strangle us at the slightest intimation of our
knowledge."I can see but the right," returned Carmen determinedly."But, my dear girl," cried Haynerd, now thoroughly alarmed both for
himself and her, "he would ruin us!We had
no intention of hearing; and so let it be as if we had not heard."Haynerd, I could not, if I
would.Ames is being used by evil; and it is making him a channel
to ruin Mr.Shall I stand idly by and permit it?She rose, with a look of fixed resolution on her face.Haynerd sprang
to his feet and laid a detaining hand upon her arm.As he did so, the
screen was quickly drawn aside, and Kathleen Ames and two of her young
companions bent their curious gaze in upon them.Absorbed in their
earnest conversation, Carmen and Haynerd had not heard the approach of
the young ladies, who were on a tour of inspection of the house before
supper."Reporters for the Social Era, Miss Ames," explained Haynerd, hastily
answering the unspoken question, while he made a courteous bow.she cried, instantly
recognizing Carmen, and drawing back.asked one of the young ladies, as her eyes roved
over Carmen's tense, motionless figure.cried Kathleen, spurting her venom at Carmen, while
her eyes snapped angrily and her hands twitched."When the front door
is closed against you, you sneak in through the back door!Leave this
house, instantly, or I shall have you thrown into the street!""She is a low, <DW64> wench!"She foisted herself upon society, and was discovered
and kicked out!Her father is a dirty <DW64> priest, and her mother a
low--"

Haynerd rushed to the maddened girl and clapped his hand over her
mouth."Hush, for God's sake, Miss Ames!"Then, to her companions,
"Take her away!"But a house detective, attracted by the loud conversation, had come up
and interposed."I can not put them out if they have his
permission to remain," he explained to the angry Kathleen.In a few moments, during which the little group stood tense and quiet,
Ames himself appeared.turning inquiringly to Haynerd.Her article in last week's Social Era was a corker.But,"
staring from Kathleen to the others, "what's the row?""I want that creature put out of the house!"demanded Kathleen,
trembling with rage and pointing to Carmen."Tut, tut," returned Ames easily."She's on business, and has my
permission to remain.that's a good joke," winking at
Haynerd and breaking into a loud laugh."You put one over on us there,
old man!"Scalding tears of anger and humiliation were streaming down
Kathleen's face."If she remains, I shall go--I shall leave the
house--I will not stay under the same roof with the lewd creature!""Very well, then, run along," said Ames, taking the humiliated
Kathleen by the shoulders and turning her about."I will settle this
without your assistance."Then he motioned to the house detectives to
depart, and turned to Haynerd and Carmen."Come in here," he said,
leading the way to the little waiting room, and opening the door.but you belong down stairs with the rest," he ejaculated as he
faced Carmen, standing before him pale but unafraid."There isn't one
down there who is in your class!"he exclaimed, placing his hands upon
her shoulders and looking down into her beautiful face."And," he
continued with sudden determination, "I am going to take you down, and
you will sit at the table with me, as my special guest!"A sudden fear gripped Haynerd, and he started to interpose.An expression of surprise and inquiry came into Ames's face."You mean Congressman--"

Then he stopped abruptly, and looked searchingly at Carmen and her
companion.Ames's expression
of surprise gave place to one dark and menacing."You were behind that screen when Congressman Wales and I--"

"Yes," returned Carmen calmly.Ames stood like a huge, black cloud, glowering down upon the slender
girl."You are going to tell him that the fifty thousand dollars are just a
loan, and that he may vote as he chooses, aren't you?""You
will not ruin his life, and the lives of his wife and babies, will
you?You would never be happy, you know, if you did."Her voice was as
quiet as the morning breeze."You come into my house to play spy, eh?And
if I had not caught you when I did you would have written another
interesting article for the Social Era, wouldn't you?I'll
break you, Haynerd, and your infernal sheet into a million pieces if
you dare print any such rot as this!And as for you, young lady--"

"You can do nothing to me, Mr.Ames; and you don't really want to,"
said Carmen quickly."My reputation, you know--that is, the one which
you people have given me--is just as black as it could be, isn't it?"It doesn't really make any
difference to you, Mr.Ames," she said, "whether the cotton schedule
is passed or not.You still have your millions--oh, so much more
than you will ever know what to do with!Wales, he has his
wife and his babies and his good reputation--would you rob him of
those priceless treasures, just to make a few dollars more for
yourself?--dollars that you can't spend, and that you won't let
others have?"During the girl's quiet talk Ames was regaining his self-control.When
she concluded he turned to Haynerd."Miss Carmen can step out into the
balcony.You and I will arrange this matter together," he said."Now," said Ames significantly, and in a low voice, "what's your
price?"Instantly the girl turned back and threw herself between the two men.she cried, her eyes flashing as she confronted
Ames.shouted Ames, who had lost himself completely, "I will
crush him like a dirty spider!And you, I'll drag you through the
gutters and make your name a synonym of all that is vile in
womanhood!"Carmen stepped quietly to the elevator and pressed the signal button.cried the enraged Ames, starting
toward her.The girl drew herself up with splendid dignity, and faced him
fearlessly."We _shall_ leave your house, and now, Mr."You and that for which you stand can not touch us!The carnal
mind is back of you!She moved away from him, then turned and stood for a moment, flashing,
sparkling, radiant with a power which he could not comprehend.You are blinded and deceived by human lust and
greed.But the god you so ignorantly worship now will some day totter
and fall upon you.Then you will awake, and you will see your present
life as a horrid dream."Carmen and the dazed Haynerd stepped quickly
into it and descended without opposition to the lower floor.A few
moments later they were again in the street and hurrying to the
nearest car line."Girlie," said Haynerd, mopping the perspiration from his brow, "we're
in for it now--and I shall be crushed!But you--I think your God will
save you.""His arm is not shortened," she murmured, "that
He can not save us both."CHAPTER 5

ON the Monday morning following the Ames reception the society columns
of the daily papers still teemed with extravagant depictions of the
magnificent affair.On that same morning, while Haynerd sat gloomily
in the office of the Social Era, meditating on his giant adversary's
probable first move, Carmen, leaving her studies and classes, sought
out an unpretentious home in one of the suburbs of the city, and for
an hour or more talked earnestly with the timid, frightened little
wife of Congressman Wales.Then, her work done, she dismissed the
whole affair from her mind, and hastened joyously back to the
University."But," she
reflected, as she dwelt on his conduct and words of the previous
Saturday evening, "he is not ready for it yet.And when he is, I will
go to him.And Kathleen--well, I will help her by seeing only the real
child of God, which was hidden that night by the veil of hatred and
jealousy.And that veil, after all, is but a shadow."That evening the little group of searchers after God assembled again
in the peaceful precincts of the Beaubien cottage.It was their third
meeting, and they had come together reverently to pursue the most
momentous inquiry that has ever stimulated human thought.Haynerd and Carmen had said little relative to the Ames reception; but
the former, still brooding over the certain consequences of his brush
with Ames, was dejected and distraught.Carmen, leaning upon her
sustaining thought, and conceding no mite of power or intelligence to
evil, glowed like a radiant star.she asked of Haynerd, drawing him to one
side."Are you giving ear to the voices of evil, or good?For those thoughts which are real to you
will become outwardly manifested, you know."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture signifying
defeat."And the insults of that arrogant daughter of his--"

"She did not insult me," said Carmen quickly."She could not, for she
doesn't know me.She merely denounced her concept of me, and not my
real self.She vilified what she thought was Carmen Ariza; but it was
only her own thought of me that she insulted.And such
a concept of me as she holds deserves denouncing, doesn't it?""Well, what are we going to do?""We are going to know," she whispered, "that we two with God
constitute an overwhelming majority."She said nothing about her visit
to the Wales home that morning, but pressed his hand, and then went to
take her place at the table, where Father Waite was already rapping
for order."My friends," began that earnest young man, looking lovingly about at
the little group, "as we are gathered here we symbolize that
analytical, critical endeavor of the unbiased human mind to discover
the essence of religion.Religion is that which binds us to absolute
truth, and so is truth itself.If there is a God, we believe from our
former investigations that He must be universal mind.This belief
carries with it as necessary corollaries the beliefs that He must be
perfect, eternal, and self-existent.must
then receive its sufficient answer in the staggering statement that He
has always existed, unchanged and unchangeable."A sigh from Haynerd announced that quizzical soul's struggle to grasp
a statement at once so radical and stupendous."True," continued Father Waite, addressing himself to his doubting
friend, "the acceptance as fact of what we have deduced in our
previous meetings must render the God of orthodox theology quite
obsolete.But, as a compensation, it gives to us the most enlarged and
beautiful concept of Him that we have ever had.It ennobles, broadens,
purifies, and elevates our idea of Him.It destroys forever our
belittling view of Him as but a magnified human character, full of
wrath and caprice and angry threats, and delighting in human
ceremonial and religious thaumaturgy.And, most practical of all for
us, it renders the age-long problem of evil amenable to solution."Just then came a ring at the front door; and a moment later the
Beaubien ushered Doctor Morton into the room.All rose and hastened to
welcome him."I--I am sure," began the visitor, looking at Carmen, "that I am not
intruding, for I really come on invitation, you know.Miss Carmen,
first; and then, our good friend Hitt, who told me this afternoon that
you would probably meet this evening.I--I pondered the matter some
little time--ah, but--well, to make it short, I couldn't keep away
from a gathering so absolutely unique as this--I really couldn't."she exclaimed, her eyes dancing,
"I am glad you came.""And I, too," interposed Haynerd dryly, "for now we have two
theological Philistines."Ah, my friend," replied the doctor, "I am simply an advocate of
religious freedom, not a--"

"And religious freedom, as our wise Bill Nye once said, is but the art
of giving intolerance a little more room, eh?"returned Haynerd with a
laugh."You are a Philistine," he said.Carmen took the doctor by the arm and led him to a place beside her at
the table."You--you didn't bring poor Yorick?"she whispered, with a
glint of mischief in her bright eyes."No," laughed the genial visitor, "he's a dead one, you told me.""Yes," replied the girl, "awfully dead!He is an outward manifestation
of dead human beliefs, isn't he?But now listen, Father Waite is going
to speak."After a brief explanation to the doctor of the purpose of the
meeting, and a short resume of their previous deductions, Father Waite
continued the exposition of his subject."The physical universe," he said, "is to human beings a reality.And
yet, according to Spencer's definition of reality, we must admit that
the universe as we see it is quite unreal.For the real is that which
endures.""And you mean to say that the universe will not endure?""The phenomena of the universe, even as
we see it, are in a state of ceaseless change.Birth, growth,
maturity, decay, and death seems to be the law for all things
material."But," again urged Haynerd, "matter itself remains, is indestructible.""Our friend, Doctor Morton, will
corroborate my statement, I am sure.""It is quite true," he said in reply.The discovery, in the past few years, of the
tremendously important fact that matter disintegrates and actually
disappears, has revolutionized all physical science and rendered the
world's text books obsolete.""The radium atom, we find, lasts some
seventeen hundred years, or a trifle longer.What becomes of it when
it is destroyed?We can only say that it disappears from human
consciousness.""And so you reason that the whole material universe will ultimately
disappear from the human consciousness?""Yes," returned Hitt, "I feel certain of it.Let us consider of what
the universe consists.For many months I have been pondering this
topic incessantly.I find that I can agree, in a measure, with those
scientists who regard the physical universe as composed of only a few
elementary constituents, namely, matter, energy, space, and time--"

"Each one of these elements is mental," interrupted Carmen."And the physical universe, even from the
human standpoint, is, therefore, wholly mental.""No," interposed Father Waite; "we see only our mental concept of a
universe, for seeing is wholly a mental process."But now," resumed Hitt, "to get back to the supposed reality of the
physical universe, let us examine its constituents.First, let us
consider its unity established by the harmonious interplay of the
forces permeating it.This great fact is what led Herbert Spencer to
conclude that the universe could have but one creator, one ruler, and
that polytheism was untenable.""We are quite agreed regarding that," said Father Waite."If the
Creator is mind, He is of very necessity infinite and omnipotent;
hence there can be but one Creator."Would it exist, but as a convenience for the human mind?Is
it not really a creation of that mind?And, lastly, is it not merely a
mental concept?""Our consciousness of time," replied Carmen, "is only our awareness of
a continuous series of mental states.""That classifies it exactly," said Hitt, "and renders it wholly
mental."We are accustomed to say,
loosely, that space is that in which we see things about us.But in
what does the process of seeing consist?What I
really mean is that I am conscious of a chair.The process of seeing,
we are told, is this: light, coming from the chair, enters the eye and
casts an image of the chair upon the retina, much as a picture is
thrown upon the ground glass of a camera.Then, in some way, the
little rods and cones--the branching tips of the optic nerve which
project from the retina--are set in motion by the light-waves.This
vibration is in some mysterious manner carried along the optic nerve
to a center in the brain, and--well, then the mind becomes cognizant
of the chair out there, that's all.""Do you mean
to say," she queried, "that, after thousands of years of thought and
investigation, mankind now know nothing more than that about the
process of seeing?""Then all I've got to say," put in Haynerd, "is that the most
remarkable thing about you learned men is your ignorance!""I find it is only the fool who is cocksure," he
replied."Now," said Hitt, resuming the conversation, "let us go a step further
and inquire, first, What is light?since the process of seeing is
absolutely dependent upon it.""Light," offered the doctor, "is vibrations, or wave-motion, so
physicists tell us.""Light, we say, consists of vibrations.Not
vibrations of anything tangible or definitely material, but--well,
just vibrations in the abstract.Now
let us concede that these vibrations in some way get to the brain
center; and then let us ask, Is the mind there, in the brain, awaiting
the arrival of these vibrations to inform it that there is a chair
outside?"Haynerd indulged in a cynical laugh."It is too serious for laughter, my friend," said Hitt."For to such
crude beliefs as this we may attribute all the miseries of mankind.""Simply because these beliefs constitute the general belief in a
universe of matter without and about us.As a plain statement of fact,
_there is no such thing_.But, I ask again, Is the mind within the
brain, waiting for vibrations that will give it information concerning
the external world?Or does the mind, from some focal point without
the brain, look first at these vibrations, and then translate them
into terms of things without?Do these vibrations in some way suggest
form and color and substance to the waiting mind?Does the mind first
look at vibrating nerve-points, and then form its own opinions
regarding material objects?"No," admitted the doctor; "unless we believe that vibrations _per se_
are material.""Now I ask, Is the mind reduced to such slavery that it must depend
upon vibrations for its knowledge of an outside world?""And vibrations of minute pieces of flesh, at that!Flesh that
will some day decay and leave the mind helpless!""Why doesn't the mind look directly at
the chair, instead of getting its knowledge of the chair through
vibrations of bits of meat?Or isn't there any chair out there to look
at?""Now you've put your mental finger upon it.And now we are ready to nail to the cross of ignominy one of the
crudest, most insensate beliefs of the human race._The human mind
gets nothing whatsoever from vibrations, from the human, fleshly eye,
nor from any one of the five so-called physical senses!_ The physical
sense-testimony which mankind believe they receive from the eyes, the
ears, and the other sense organs, can, even at best, consist only of a
lot of disconnected, unintelligible vibrations; and anything that the
mind may infer from such vibrations is inferred _without any outside
authority whatsoever!ejaculated Miss Wall and Haynerd in a breath."And, further," continued Hitt, "we are forced to admit that all that
the mind knows is the contents of itself, of its own consciousness,
and nothing more.Then, instead of seeing, hearing, and feeling real
material objects outside of ourselves, we are in reality seeing,
hearing, and feeling our own mental concepts of things--in other
words, _our own thoughts of things!"_

A deep silence lay for some moments over the little group at the
conclusion of Hitt's words.Then Doctor Morton nodded his acquiescence
in the deduction."And that," he said, "effectually disposes of the
question of space.""There is no space, Doctor," replied Hitt.The human mind sees, hears, and feels nothing but its own
thoughts.These it posits within itself with reference to one another,
and calls the process'seeing material objects in space.'The mind as
little needs a space in which to see things as in which to dream them.I repeat, we do not see external things, or things outside of
ourselves.We see always and only the thoughts that are within our own
mentalities."That's why," murmured Carmen, "Jesus said, 'The kingdom of heaven is
within you.'""Did he not call evil, and all that originates
in matter, the lie about God?I tell you,
the existence of a world outside of ourselves, an objective world
composed of matter, is wholly inferred--it is mental visualizing--and
it is unreal, for it is not based upon fact, upon truth!""Then," queried Haynerd, "our supposed 'outer world' is but our
collection of thought-concepts which we hold within us, within our own
consciousness, eh?""We are ready for that again," replied Hitt."We have said that in the
physical universe all is in a state of incessant change.Since the
physical universe is but a mental concept to each one of us, we must
admit that, were the concept based upon truth, it would not change.Our concept of the universe must be without the real causative and
sustaining principle of all reality, else would it not pass away.And
yet, beneath and behind all these changes, _something_ endures.There is an enduring substance, invisible to human
sight, but felt and known through its own influence.But none of these things is in any sense
material.The material is the fleeting, human concept, composed of
thought that is _not_ based upon reality.These other things, wholly
mental, or spiritual, if you prefer, are based upon that'something'
which does endure, and which I will call the Causative Principle."I think," interposed Doctor Morton at this juncture, "that I can
throw some light upon the immaterial character of matter, if I may so
put it; for even our physical reasoning throws it entirely into the
realm of the mental."The doctor sat for some moments in a deep study.Then he began:

"The constitution of matter, speaking now from an admittedly
materialistic standpoint, that of the physical sciences, is a subject
of vastest interest and importance to mankind, for human existence
_is_ material."The ultimate constituent of matter has been called the atom.But we
have said little when we have said that.The atom was once defined as
a particle of matter so minute as to admit of no further division.That definition has gone to the rubbish heap, for the atom can now be
torn to pieces.But--and here is the revolutionary fact in modern
physical science--_it is no longer held necessary that matter should
consist of material particles!_ In fact, the great potential discovery
of our day is that matter is electrical in composition, that it is
composed of what are called 'electrons,' and that these electrons are
themselves composed of electric charges.It is without weight, bulk, dimensions, or
tangibility.Well, then, it comes dangerously near being a mental
thing, known to the human mind solely by its manifestations, does it
not?And of course our comprehension of it is entirely mental, as is
our comprehension of everything."He paused for a moment, that his words might be fully grasped.Then he
went on:

"Now these atoms, whatever they are, are supposed to join together to
form molecules.Why, it is--well, law, if you please.Then, going a step further,
molecules are held together by cohesion to form material objects,
chairs, trees, coal, and the like."But, Doctor--" interrupted Haynerd."Now we
have the very latest word from our physical scientists regarding the
constitution of matter: _it is composed of electric charges, held
together by law._ Again, you may justly ask: Is matter material--or
mental?"He paused again, and took up a book that lay before him."Here," he continued, "I hold a solid, material, lumpy thing,
composed, you will say, of matter.And yet, in essence, and if we can
believe our scientists, this book is composed of billions of electric
charges--invisible things, without form, without weight, without
color, without extension, held together by law, and making up a
material object which has mass, color, weight, and extension.From
millions of things which are invisible and have no size, we get an
object, visible and extended.""Yet, the doctor is giving the very latest
deductions of the great scientists.""But, Doctor," said Father Waite, "the scientists tell us that they
have experimental evidence in support of the theories which you have
stated regarding the composition of matter.Electricity has been
proven granular, or atomic, in structure.And every electrical
charge consists of an exact number of electrical atoms spread out
over the surface of the charged body."Admitted," said Hitt, taking up the challenge."And their very
calculations and deductions are rapidly wearing away the'materialistic
theory' of matter.You will admit that mathematics is wholly
confined to the realm of mind.It is a strictly mental science, in no
way material.It loses definiteness when 'practically' applied to
material objects.Kant saw this, and declared that a science might be
regarded as further removed from or nearer to perfection in proportion
to the amount of mathematics it contained.Now there has been an
astonishing confirmation of this great truth just lately.At a banquet
given in honor of the discoverer of wireless telegraphy it was stated
that the laws governing the traversing of space by the invisible
electric waves were more exact than the general laws of physics,
where very complex formulas and coefficients are required for
correcting the general laws, due to surrounding material conditions.The greater exactness of laws governing the invisible electric waves
was said to be due to the absence of matter.And it was further
stated that _whenever matter had to be taken into consideration there
could be no exact law of action!"That matter admits of no definite laws," replied Hitt."That there
are no real laws of matter.And that definiteness is attained only as
we dematerialize matter itself.""In other words, get into the realm of the mental?"I have said that we do not
receive any testimony whatsoever through the so-called material
senses, but that we see, hear, feel, taste, and smell our own
thoughts--that is, the thoughts which, from some source, come into our
mentalities.Very well, our scientists show us that, as they get
farther away from dense material thoughts, and deal more and more with
those which have less material structure, less material composition,
their laws become more definite, more exact.Following this out to its
ultimate conclusion, we may say, then, that _only those laws which
have to do with the non-material are perfect_.""And those," said Carmen, "are the laws of mind."And now the history of physical science shows that there has
been a constant deviation from the old so-called fixed 'laws of
matter.'The law of impenetrability has had to go.A great physicist
tells us that, when dealing with sufficiently high speeds, matter has
no such property as impenetrability.The law of indestructibility has had to go.Matter deteriorates and
goes to pieces.The decided
tendency of belief is toward a single element, of which all matter is
composed, and of which the eighty-odd constituent elements of matter
accepted to-day are but modifications.That unit element may be the
ether, of course.And the great Russian chemist, Mendeleef, so
believed.But to us, the ether is a mental thing, a theory.But,
granting its existence, _its universal penetrability renders matter,
as we know it, non-existent_.Everything reduces to the ether, in the
final analysis.And all energy becomes vibrations in and of the
ether.""And the ether," supplemented the doctor, "has to be without mass,
invisible, tasteless, intangible, much more rigid than steel, and at
the same time some six hundred billion times lighter than air, in
order to fulfill all the requirements made of it and to meet all
conditions.""Yes; and yet the ether is a very necessary theory, if we are going to
continue to explain the phenomena of force on a material basis.""Then," said Carmen, "matter reduces to what it really is, the human
mind's _interpretation_ of substance.""Yes," said Hitt, turning to her; "I think you are right; matter is
the way real substance--let us say, spirit--looks to the human
mentality.It is the way the human mind interprets its ideas of
spirit.In other words, the human mind looks at the material thoughts
and ideas which enter it, and calls them solid substance, occupying
space--calls them matter, with definite laws, and, in certain forms,
containing life and intelligence.""And that has been the terrible
mistake of the ages, the one great error, the one lie, that has caused
us all to miss the mark and come short, far short, of the glory of the
mind that is God._There is the origin of the problem of evil!_"

"Undoubtedly," replied Hitt."For evil is in essence but evil thought.The origin of
all evil is matter itself.And matter, we find, is but a mental
concept, a thing of thought."Well," put in Haynerd, who had been twitching nervously in his chair,
"let's get to the conclusion of this very learned discussion.I'm a
plain man, and I'd like to know just where we've landed.What have you
said that I can take home with me?The earth still revolves around the
sun, even if it is a mean mud ball.And I can't see that I can get
along with less than three square meals a day.""We have arrived," replied Hitt gravely, "at a most momentous
conclusion, deduced by the physical scientists themselves, namely,
that _things are not what they seem_.In other words, all things
material seem to reduce to vibrations in and of the ether; the basis
of all materiality is energy, motion, activity--mental things.All the
elements of matter seem to be but modifications of one all-pervading
element.That element is probably the ether, often called the'mother
of matter.'The elements, such as carbon, silicon, and the others, are
not elementary at all, but are forms of one universal element, the
ether.The so-called rare elements are
rare only because their lives are short.They disintegrate rapidly and
change into other forms of the universal element--or disappear.'Atoms
are but fleeting phases of matter,' we are told.They are by no means
eternal, even though they may endure for millions of years.""A great scientist of our own day," Hitt continued, "has said that
'the ether is so modified as to constitute matter, in some way.'Simply that 'visible matter and invisible ether are
one and the same thing.'But to the five so-called physical senses the
ether is utterly incomprehensible.So, then, matter is wholly
incomprehensible to the five physical senses.What is it, then, that
we call matter?It can be nothing more than the human mind's
interpretation of its idea of an all-pervading, omnipresent
_something_, a something which represents substance to it.""Let me add a further quotation from the great physical scientist to
whom you have referred," said the doctor."He has said that the ether
is _not_ matter, but that it is material.And further, that we can not
deny that the ether may have some mental and spiritual functions to
subserve in some other order of existence, as matter has in this.It
is wholly unrelated to any of our senses.The sense of sight takes
cognizance of it, but only in a very indirect and not easily
recognized way.And yet--stupendous conclusion!--_without the ether
there could be no material universe at all_!""In other words," said Hitt, "the whole fabric of the material
universe depends upon something utterly unrecognizable by the five
physical senses.""Then," concluded Hitt, "the physical senses give us no information
whatsoever of a real physical universe about us.""And so," added Father Waite, "we come back to Carmen's statement,
namely, that seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling are
mental processes, in no way dependent upon the outer fleshly organs of
sense--"

"Nonsense!""Why is it, then, that if the eyes
are destroyed we do not see?""Simply, my friend, because of human belief," replied Hitt."The human
mind has been trained for untold centuries to dependence upon beliefs
in the reality of matter, and beliefs in its dependence upon material
modes for sight, hearing, touch, and so on.It is because of its
erroneous beliefs that the human mind is to-day enslaved by matter,
and dependent upon it for its very sense of existence.The human mind
has made its sense of sight dependent upon a frail, pulpy bit of
flesh, the eye.As long as that fleshly organ remains intact, the
human mind sees its sense of sight externalized in the positing of its
mental concepts about it as natural objects.But let that fleshly eye
be destroyed, and the human mind sees its belief of dependence upon
the material eye externalized as blindness.When the fleshly eye is
gone the mind declares that it can no longer see.And what it declares
as truth, as fact, becomes externalized to it.I repeat, the human
mind sees and hears only its thoughts, its beliefs.And holding to
these beliefs, and making them real to itself, it eventually sees them
externalized in what it calls its outer world, its environment, its
universe.And yet, the materialistic scientists themselves show that
the human mind can take no cognizance whatever through the five
physical senses of the all-pervading basis of its very existence, the
ether.it is but a theory which we find necessary
for any intelligible explanation of the farce of human existence on a
material basis."retorted Haynerd, rising and giving expression to his
protest by means of emphatic gestures.You
tell me that the existence of things demands a creator, and I admit
it, for there can be no effect without a cause.Then you say that the
universe is infinite; and I admit that, too, for the science of
astronomy finds no limits to space, and no space unoccupied.You say
that the unity manifested in the universe proves that there can be but
one creator.Moreover, to create an infinite universe there must needs
be an omnipotent creator; and there can be but one who is omnipotent.Further, I can see how that creator must be
mind--infinite mind.And I can see why that mind must be absolutely
perfect, with no intelligence of evil whatsoever, else would it be a
house divided against itself.Now I admit that the universe must be the manifestation, the
expression, of that infinite creative mind.But--and here's the
sticking point--the universe is both good and evil!Hence, the mind
which it manifests is likewise both good and evil--and the whole
pretty theory blows up!"He sat down abruptly, with the air of having given finality to a
perplexing question.All eyes then turned to Carmen, who slowly rose and surveyed the
little group."It is not surprising," she said, smiling at the confused Haynerd,
"that difficulties arise when you attempt to reach God through human
reasoning--spirit through matter.You have taken the unreal, and,
through it, have sought to reach back to the real.""Well," interrupted Haynerd testily, "kindly explain the difference.""Then, first," replied Carmen, "let us adopt some common meeting
ground, some basis which we can all accept, and from which we can
rise.Are you all agreed that, in our every-day life, everything is
mental?--every action?--every object?--and that, as the philosopher
Mill said, 'Everything is a feeling of which the mind is conscious'?Let me illustrate my meaning," she continued, noting Haynerd's rising
protest."I see this book; I take it up; and drop it upon the table.No; I have been conscious of thoughts which
I call a book, nothing more.A real material book did not get into my
mind; but _thoughts_ of a book did.And the activity of such thought
resulted in a state of consciousness--for consciousness is mental
activity, the activity of thought.Remember that, even according to
your great physical scientists, this book is composed of millions of
charges of electricity, or electrons, moving at a tremendously high
rate of speed.And yet, regardless of its composition, I am conscious
only of my thoughts of the book.It is but my thoughts that I see,
after all."She paused and waited for the protest which was not voiced."Very well," she said, continuing; "so it is with the sense of touch;
I had the thought of touching it, and that thought I saw; I was
conscious of it when it became active in my mentality.So with sound;
when I let the book drop, I was conscious of my thought of sound.If
the book had been dropped in a vacuum I should not have been conscious
of a thought of sound--why?Hitt has told us, the
human mind has made its sense-testimony dependent upon vibrations.And
yet, there is a clock ticking up there on the wall."Yes," replied Haynerd; "now that you've called my attention to it.""You hear it when your thought is
directed to it.And yet the air was vibrating all the time, and, if
hearing is dependent upon the fleshly ear, you should have heard it
incessantly when you were not thinking of it, as well as you hear it
now when you are thinking of it."Well, perhaps so," assented Haynerd with some reluctance."We hear, see, and feel," continued the girl, "when our thought is
directed to these processes.And the processes are wholly mental--they
take place within our mentalities--and it is there, within our minds,
that we see, hear, and feel _all_ things.And it is there, within our
minds, that the universe exists for us.It is there that we hold our
world, our fleshly bodies, everything that we call material._The
universe that we think we see all about us consists of the mental
concepts, made up of thought, which we hold within our mentalities_."Carmen proceeded with the
exposition of her theme."Whence come these material thoughts that are within us?They are real to us, at any rate,
are they not?And if they are thoughts of pain and suffering and
death, they are terribly real to us.But let us see, now that we can
reason from the basis of the mental nature of all things.We have
agreed that the creative principle is mind, and we call it God.This
infinite mind constantly expresses and manifests itself in ideas.Why,
that is a fundamental law of mind!You express yourself in your ideas
and thoughts, which you try to externalize materially.But the
infinite mind expresses itself in an infinite number and variety of
ideas, all, like itself, pure, perfect, eternal, good, without any
elements or seeds of decay or discord.And the incessant expression of
the creative mind in and through its numberless ideas constitutes the
never-ending process of creation.""Let me add here," interrupted Hitt, "that the Bible states that God
created the heavens and earth in seven days.But numbers, we must
remember, were mystical things to the ancient Hebrews, and were
largely used symbolically.The number seven, for example, was used to
express wholeness, completeness.So we must remember that its use in
Genesis has a much wider meaning than its absurd theological
interpretation into seven solar days.As Carmen says, the infinite
creative mind can never cease to express itself; creation can never
cease; and creation is but the whole, complete revelation or
unfoldment of infinite mind's ideas.""And infinite mind," continued Carmen, "requires infinite time in
which to completely express itself.So time ceases to be, and we find
that all real things exist now, in an endless present.Now, the ideas
of infinite mind range throughout the realm of infinity, but the
greatest idea that the creative mind can have is the idea of itself.That idea is the image and likeness of the infinite creative mind.It
is the perfect reflection of that mind--its perfect expression.That
idea is what the man Jesus always saw back of the human concept of
man."That's quite a different proposition from
the mud-men that I do business with daily."If they were real," said Carmen, "they would have to be children of
God.But then they would not be'mud-men.'Now I have just spoken of
the real, the spiritual creation.That is the creation mentioned in
the first chapter of Genesis, where all was created--revealed,
unfolded--by God, and He saw that it was perfect, good.'In the
beginning,' says the commentator.That is, 'To begin with--God.'Everything begins with God in the realm of the real.And the creation, or unfoldment, is like its creative
principle, eternal and good.""But," persisted Haynerd, "how about the material man?""Having created all things spiritually," continued the girl, "was it
necessary that the creative mind should repeat its work, do it over
again, and produce the man of dust described in the second chapter of
Genesis?Is that second account of the creation an inspiration of
truth--or a human comment?""Call it what you will," said the cynical Haynerd; "the fact remains
that the mud-man exists and has to be reckoned with.""Both of your premises are wholly incorrect," returned the girl
gently."He does _not_ exist, excepting in human, mortal thought.He
is a product of only such thought.He and his material universe are
seen and dealt with only in such thought.And such thought is the
direct antithesis of God's thought.It is
the supposition, the lie, the mist that went up and darkened the
earth.""Is just what you have said, a hue of a man, a dark hue, the shadowy
opposite which seems to counterfeit the real, spiritual man and claim
all his attributes.He is not a compound of mind and matter, for we
have seen that all things are mental, even matter itself.He is a sort
of mentality, a counterfeit of real mind.His body and his universe
are in himself.And, like all that is unreal, he is transient,
passing, ephemeral, mortal.""No, for he does not exist, excepting in supposition.If so, then not even truth can destroy it.No, the human mind is the
'old man' of Paul.He is to be put off by knowing his nothingness, and
by knowing the unreality of his supposed material environment and
universe.As he goes out of consciousness, the real man, the idea of
God, perfect, harmonious, and eternal, comes in.""And there," said Father Waite impressively, "you have the whole
scheme of salvation, as enunciated by the man Jesus.""There is no doubt of it," added Hitt.how
futile, how base, how worse than childish now appear the whole
theological fabric of the churches, their foolish man-made dogmas,
their insensate beliefs in a fiery hell and a golden heaven.Oh, how
belittling now appear their concepts of God--a God who can damn
unbaptised infants, who can predestine his children to eternal sorrow,
who creates and then curses his handiwork!Do you wonder that sin,
sorrow, and death remain among us while such awful beliefs hold sway
over the human mind?Haynerd, who had been sitting quietly for some moments, deep in
thought, rose and held out his hands, as if in entreaty.It seems--it seems as if a curtain had been raised suddenly.And what I
see beyond is--"

Carmen went swiftly to the man and slipped an arm about him."That
infinite creative Mind, so misunderstood and misinterpreted by human
beings, is back of you," she whispered."But had I not seen the proof in you, no amount of reasoning would
have convinced me."And, bowing to the little group, he went out.said Hitt, turning inquiringly to the doctor."If these things are true," he made answer
slowly, "then I shall have to recast my entire mentality, my whole
basis of thinking.""It is just what you _must_ do, Doctor, if you would work out your
salvation," said Carmen."Jesus said we must repent if we would be
saved.Repentance--the Greek _metanoia_--means a complete and radical
change of thought.""But--do you mean to say that the whole world has been mistaken?That
the entire human race has been deceived for ages?""Why," said Hitt, "it was only in our own day, comparatively speaking,
that the human race was undeceived in regard to the world being round.And there are thousands of human beings to-day who still believe in
witchcraft, and who worship the sun and moon, and whose lives are
wholly under the spell of superstition.Human character, a great
scientist tells us, has not changed since history began.""But we can't revamp our thought-processes!""Then we must go on missing the mark, sinning, suffering, sorrowing,
and dying, over and over and over again, until we decide that we can
do so," said Hitt.The doctor looked at Carmen and met that same smile of unbounded love
which she gave without stint to a sin-weary world."I--I'll come again," he said."Yes," said Carmen, rising and coming around to him."And," in a
whisper, "bring Pat."CHAPTER 6


The Social Era had for many years made its weekly appearance every
Saturday morning, that its fashionable clientele might appease their
jaded appetites on the Sabbath day by nibbling at its spicy pabulum.But, though the Ames reception had fallen on a Saturday night, the
following Friday morning found the columns of the Era still awaiting
a report of the notable affair.Whenever he set his pen to the task, there loomed before him only the
scene in the little waiting room, and he could write of nothing else.He found himself still dwelling upon the awful contrast between the
slender wisp of a girl and her mountainous opponent, as they had stood
before him; and the terrifying thoughts of what was sure to follow in
consequence drenched his skin with cold perspiration.On the desk before him lay the essay which he had asked Carmen to
write during the week, as her report of the brilliant event.He had
read it through three times, and each time had read into it a new
meaning.Not that it ridiculed or condemned--at
least, not openly--but because every one of its crisp comments
admitted of an interpretation which revealed the hidden depths of the
social system, and its gigantic incarnation, as if under the glare of
a powerful searchlight.It was in no sense a muck-raking exposition.Rather, it was an interpretation, and a suggestion.It was, too, a
prediction; but not a curse.The girl loved those about whom she
wrote.And yet, he who read the essay aright would learn that her love
stopped not at the flimsy veil of the flesh, but penetrated until it
rested upon the fair spiritual image beyond.And then Haynerd saw that
the essay was, in substance, a social clinic, to which all searchers
after truth were bidden, that they might learn a great lesson from her
skillful dissection of the human mind, and her keen analysis of its
constituent thought.As he sat wrapped in reflection, the early morning mail was brought
in.He glanced up, and then started to his feet.The letters spread
over his desk like an avalanche of snow; and the puffing mail carrier
declared that he had made a special trip with them alone.Haynerd
began to tear them open, one after another.Then he called the office
boy, and set him at the task.There were more than five hundred of
them, and each contained a canceled subscription to the Social Era.A dark foreboding settled down over Haynerd's mind.He rose and went
to the card-index to consult his subscription list.He
stood confusedly for a moment, then hastened to the window that looked
out upon a fire-escape.He turned
and rushed to the vault, which, reflecting his own habitual
carelessness, was never locked.His ledgers and account books were not
there.Then he crept back to his desk and sank into a chair.The noon mail brought more letters of like nature, until the office
boy tallied nearly eight hundred.Then Haynerd, as if rousing from a
dream, reached for the telephone and summoned Hitt to his rescue.Its mailing list had contained some
fifteen hundred names.The subscription price was twelve dollars a
year--and never, to his knowledge, had it been paid in advance by his
ultra-rich patrons, most of whom were greatly in arrears.Haynerd saw
it all vanishing now as quietly as the mist fades before the summer
sun.Within an hour the wondering Hitt was in conference with him, and
Haynerd had told the story of the theft, of the Ames bribe, and the
encounter following."But," he cried, "can Ames kill my entire
subscription list, and in a single week?""Easily," replied Hitt, "and in any one of several ways.Apparently he
had caused your subscription list and books to be stolen.Or, rather, Ames has lifted it bodily from the sky."Carmen
and I saw him bribe Wales!"Forget all that," he said, laying a hand on the excited
man's arm."Remember, that Wales would never dare breathe a word of
it; Carmen has no reputation or standing whatsoever now in this city;
and Ames would make out a case of blackmail against you so quickly
that it would sweep you right into the Tombs.And first, let
us get the girl herself down here."He took the telephone and called up several of the University
departments, after first ascertaining that she was not at her home.Then, having located her, he plunged into a study of the situation
with the distracted publisher."Here I waste my
evenings in learned philosophical discussions with you people, and
meantime, while we're figuring out that there is no evil, that
monster, Ames, stretches out a tentacle and strangles me!Fine
practical discussions we've been having, ain't they?I tell you, I'm
through with 'em!"He brought his fist down upon the desk with a
crash."Ned," said Hitt, "you're a fool."Here I had a nice, clean
business, no work, good pay--and, just because I associated with you
and that girl, the whole damn thing goes up the flue!Pays to be good,
doesn't it?"H'm; well, Ned, you're not only a fool, but a blooming idiot,"
replied Hitt calmly."And if you run out of
epithets, I'll supply a few!I'm a--"

The door swung open, and Carmen entered, fresh as the sea breeze, and
panting with her haste."Do you know," she began eagerly, "two men
followed me all the way down from the University!They watched me
come in here, and--but, what is wrong with you two?"She stopped and
looked inquiringly from one to the other."Well," began Hitt hesitatingly, "we were reflecting--"

"Reflecting?"We were just holding a wake, that's all," muttered Haynerd.Hitt pushed out a chair for the girl, and bade her sit down.Then he
briefly related the events which had led to her being summoned."And
now," he concluded, "the question is, does Wales know that you and Ned
saw Ames try to bribe him?""I did--last Monday morning, early," answered the wondering girl.ejaculated Haynerd, turning upon Hitt and waving
his arms about."What do you--"

"Hold your tongue, Ned!"Then, to Carmen, "Why did
you tell her?""Why--to save her, and her husband, and babies!"But, to save them, you have ruined Ned," pursued Hitt.The girl turned to Haynerd, who sat doubled up in his chair, the
picture of despair.It was the first time
she had used this name in addressing him.And if you have been pushed out of this business, it is because
it isn't fit for you, and because you've been awakened.You are for
higher, better things than the publishing of such a magazine as the
Social Era.I knew you just couldn't stay at this work.You have got
to go up--"

"Eh!"Haynerd had roused out of his torpor.Yes, I've gone up,
nicely!And I was making ten thousand dollars a year out of it!"I wasn't speaking of money," she said."When I talk, it's in dollars and
cents!""And that's why your talk is mostly nonsense," put in Hitt."The
girl's right, I guess.You've stagnated here long enough, Ned.There's
no such thing as standing still."You now have a grand opportunity," said Carmen, taking his hand."Yes; every trial in this life is an opportunity to prove that there
is no evil," she said."Listen; you have been trained as a publisher.Very well, the world is waiting for the right kind of publications.Oh, I've seen it for a long, long time.The demand is simply
tremendous.Haynerd looked confusedly from Carmen to Hitt."What, exactly, do you mean, Carmen?""Let him publish now a clean magazine, or paper; let him print real
news; let him work, not for rich people's money, but for all people.Why, the press is the greatest educator in the world!But, oh, how it
has been abused!Now let him come out boldly and stand for clean
journalism.Let him find his own life, his own good, in service for
others.""But, Carmen," protested Hitt, "do the people want clean journalism?"It could, if it had the right thought back of it," returned the
confident girl.Haynerd had again lapsed into sulky silence.But Hitt pondered the
girl's words for some moments.She was not the first nor the only one
who had voiced such sentiments.He himself had even dared to hold the
same thoughts, and to read in them a leading that came not from
material ambitions.Then, of a sudden, an idea flamed up in his mind.Hitt's eyes widened with his expanding
thought."Carlson, editor of the Express, wants to sell," he
continued, speaking rapidly."It's a semi-weekly newspaper, printed only for country circulation;
has no subscription list," commented Haynerd, with a cynical shrug of
his shoulders.The abruptness of the strange, apparently irrelevant question
startled the girl."Why," she replied slowly, "as old as--as God."And, as human beings reckon time, eighteen, eh?"Hitt then turned to
Haynerd."How much money can you scrape together, if you sell this lot
of junk?"he asked, sweeping the place with a glance."Five or six thousand, all told, including bank account, bonds, and
everything, I suppose," replied Haynerd mechanically."Carlson wants forty thousand for the Express.I'm not a rich man, as
wealth is estimated to-day, but--well, oil is still flowing down in
Ohio.It isn't the money--it's--it's what's back of the cash."Carmen reached over and laid a hand on his arm."We can do it," she
whispered.Hitt hesitated a moment longer, then sprang to his feet."I've pondered and studied this scheme for a year,
but I've only to-day seen the right help.That is your tremendous,
driving thought," he said, turning to Carmen."That thought is a
spiritual dynamite, that will blast its way through every material
obstacle!Ned," seizing Haynerd by the shoulder and shaking him out of
his chair, "rouse up!Now I'll 'phone Carlson
right away and make an appointment to talk business with him.Haynerd blinked for a few moments, like an owl in the light.But then,
as a comprehension of Hitt's plan dawned upon his waking thought, he
straightened up.The clientele of the Express will not be made up
of his puppets!"But--your University work, Hitt?""I was only biding my time," she replied gently.Tears began to trickle slowly down Haynerd's cheeks, as the tension in
his nerves slackened.He rose and seized the hands of his two friends."Hitt," he said, in a choking voice, "I--I said I was a fool.The real man has waked up, and--well, what are you
standing there for, you great idiot?*       *       *       *       *

Again that evening the little group sat about the table in the dining
room of the Beaubien cottage.But only the three most directly
concerned, and the Beaubien, knew that the owner of the Express had
received that afternoon an offer for the purchase of his newspaper,
and that he had been given twenty-four hours in which to accept it.Doctor Morton was again present; and beside him sat his lifelong
friend and jousting-mate, the very Reverend Patterson Moore.Hitt
took the floor, and began speaking low and earnestly."We must remember," he said, "in conjunction with what we have deduced
regarding the infinite creative mind and its manifestations, that we
mortals in our daily mundane existence deal only and always with
phenomena, with appearances, with effects, and never with ultimate
causes.And so all our material knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only.Of the ultimate essence of things, the human mind
knows nothing.A phenomenon may be
so-and-so with regard to another; but that either is absolute truth we
can not affirm.And yet--mark this well--as Spencer says, 'Every one
of the arguments by which the relativity of our knowledge is
demonstrated distinctly postulates the positive existence of something
beyond the relative.'""It is a primitive statement of what is sometimes called the 'Theory
of suppositional opposites'", replied Hitt."It means that to every
reality there is the corresponding unreality.For every truth there
may be postulated the supposition.We can not, as the great
philosopher says, conceive that our knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only, without at the same time conceiving a reality of
which they are appearances.He further amplifies this by saying that
'every positive notion--the concept of a thing by what it is--suggests
a negative notion--the concept of a thing by what it is not.But,
though these mutually suggest each other, _the positive alone is
real_.'For, interpreted, it means: we
must deny the seeming, or that which appears to human sense, in order
to see that which is real."exclaimed Miss Wall, glancing about to note the
effect of the speaker's words on the others.But Carmen nodded her thorough agreement, and added: "Did not Jesus
say that we must deny ourselves?Why, the self that
appears to us, the matter-man, the dust-man, the man of the second
chapter of Genesis.We must deny his reality, and know that he is
nothing but a mental concept, formed out of suppositional thought, out
of dust-thought."Undoubtedly correct," said Hitt, turning to Carmen."But, before we
consider the astonishing teachings of Jesus, let us sum up the
conclusions of philosophy.To begin with, then, there is a First
Cause, omnipotent and omnipresent, and of very necessity perfect.That
Cause lies back of all the phenomena of life; and, because of its real
existence, there arises the suppositional existence of its opposite,
its negative, so to speak, which is unreal.The phenomena of human
existence have to do _only_ with the suppositional existence of the
great First Cause's opposite.They are a reflection of that
supposition.Hence all human knowledge of an external world is but
phenomenal, and consists of appearances which have no more real
substance than have shadows._We, as mortals, know but the shadowy,
phenomenal existence._ _We do not know reality._ _Therefore, our
knowledge is not real knowledge, but supposition._

"Now," he went on hastily, for he saw an expression of protest on
Reverend Moore's face, "we are more or less familiar with a phenomenal
existence, with appearances, with effects; and our knowledge of these
is entirely mental.These thoughts, such
as feeling, seeing, hearing, and so on, we ignorantly attribute to the
five physical senses.This is what Ruskin calls the 'pathetic
fallacy.'And because we do so, we find ourselves absolutely dependent
upon these senses--in belief.Moreover, quoting Spencer again, only
the absolutely real is the absolutely persistent, or enduring.The truth of the multiplication table will endure
eternally."No," admitted Miss Wall, speaking for the others."And, as regards material objects which we seem to see and touch,"
went on Hitt, "we appear to see solidity and hardness, and we conceive
as real objects what are only the mental signs or indications of
objects.Remember, matter does not and can not get into the mind.Only
thoughts and ideas enter our mentalities.We see our _thoughts_ of
hardness, solidity, and so on; and these thoughts point to something
that is real.I repeat: _the ideas of the
infinite creative Mind_.The thoughts of size, shape, hardness, and so
on, which we group together and call material chairs, trees,
mountains, and other objects, are but'relative realities,' pointing
to the absolute reality, infinite mind and its eternal ideas and
thoughts."But all seemed absorbed in his
statements.Then he resumed:

"Our concept of matter, which is now proven to be but a mental
concept, built up out of false thought, points to _mind_ as the real
substance.Our concept of measurable space and distance is the direct
opposite of the great truth that infinite mind is ever-present.Our
concept of time is the opposite of infinity.Age is the opposite of eternity--and the old-age thought
brings extinction.So, _to every reality there is the corresponding
unreality_.If the infinite creative
mind is good--and we saw that by very necessity it _must_ be so--then
evil becomes an awful unreality, and is real only to the false thought
which entertains or holds it.If life is real--and infinite mind must
itself be life--then death becomes the opposite unreality.And, as
Jesus said, it can be overcome.But were it real, _no power_, _divine
or human_, _could ever overcome or destroy it_!""Seems to me," remarked Haynerd dryly, "that our study so far simply
goes to show, as Burke puts it, 'what shadows we are and what shadows
we pursue.'""When the world humiliates itself to the point that it
will accept that, my friend," he said, "then it will become receptive
to truth."But now let us go a little further," he went on."The great Lamarck
voiced a mighty fact when he said, 'Function precedes structure.'For
by that we mean that the egg did not produce the bird, but the bird
the egg.The world seems about to pass from the very foolish belief
that physical structure is the cause of life, to the great fact that a
_sense_ of life produces the physical structure.The former crude
belief enslaved man to his body.The latter tends to free him from
such slavery.""You see, Doctor," interrupted Carmen, "the brain which you were
cutting up the other day did not make poor Yorick's mind and thought,
but his mind made the brain."The doctor smiled and shook a warning finger at the girl."The body," resumed Hitt, "is a manifestation of the human mind's
activity.What constitutes the difference between a bird and a steam
engine?This, in part: the engine is made by human hands from without;
the bird makes itself, that is, its body, from within.But the ignorant human mind--ignorant _per se_--falls
a slave to its own creation, the mental concept which it calls its
physical body, and which it pampers and pets and loves, until it can
cling to it no longer, because the mental concept, not being based on
any real principle, is forced to pass away, having nothing but false
thought to sustain it.""But now," interposed Haynerd, who was again waxing impatient, "just
what is the practical application of all this abstruse reasoning?""The very greatest imaginable, my friend," replied Hitt.And so matter can not become non-existent _unless it
is already nothing_!The world is beginning to recognize the
tremendous fact that from nothing nothing can be made.Very well,
since the law of the conservation of energy seems to be established as
regards energy _in toto_, why, we must conclude that there is no such
thing as _annihilation_.And that means that _there is no such thing
as absolute creation_!The shadow
never was real, and does not exist.And so creation becomes unfolding,
or revelation, or development, of what already exists, and has always
existed, and always will exist.Therefore, if matter, and all it
includes as concomitants, evil, sin, sickness, accident, chance, lack,
and death, is based upon unreal, false thought, then it can all be
removed, put out of consciousness, by a knowledge of truth and a
reversal of our accustomed human thought-processes.""And that," said Carmen, "is salvation.It is based on righteousness,
which is right-thinking, thinking true thoughts, and thinking truly.""And knowing," added Hitt, "that evil, including matter, is the
suppositional opposite of truth.The doctrine of materialism has been
utterly disproved even by the physicists themselves.For physicists
have at last agreed that inertia is the great essential property of
matter.That is, matter is not a cause, but an effect.It does not
operate, but is operated upon.It is not a law-giver, but is subject
to the human mind's so-called laws concerning it.It of itself is
utterly without life or intelligence."Now Spencer said that matter was a
manifestation of an underlying power or force.Physicists tell us that
matter is made of electricity, that it is an electrical phenomenon,
and that the ultimate constituent of matter is the electron.The
electron is said by some to be made up of superimposed layers of
positive and negative electricity, and by others to be made up of only
negative charges.I rather prefer the latter view, for if composed of
only negative electricity it is more truly a negation.Matter is the
_negative_ of real substance.Hence matter is a form of
energy also.But our comprehension of it is _wholly mental_.The only real energy there is or can be is the energy of the
infinite mind we call God.This the human mind copies, or imitates,
by reason of what has been called 'the law of suppositional
opposites,' already dwelt upon at some length.Gravitation is regarded by some physicists as the negative aspect of
radiation-pressure, the latter being the pressure supposed to be
exerted by all material bodies upon one another.The third law of
motion illustrates this so-called law, for it states that action
and reaction are equal and opposite.There can be no positive action
without a resultant negative one.The divine
mind, God, has His opposite in the communal human, or mortal, mind.The latter is manifested by the so-called minds which we call mankind.And from these so-called minds issue matter and material forms and
bodies, with their so-called material laws."Yes, the material universe is running down.The
entire human concept is running down.Matter, the human mental
concept, is not eternally permanent.Neither, therefore, are its
concomitants, sin and discord.Matter disintegrates and passes
away--out of human consciousness.The whole material universe--the
so-called mortal-mind concept--is hastening to its death!""But as yet I think you have not given Mr.Haynerd the practical
application which he asks," suggested Father Waite, as Hitt paused
after his long exposition."I am now ready for that," replied Hitt."We have said that the
material is the relative.But,
that being so, we can go a step further and add that human error is
likewise relative.And now--startling fact!--_it is absolutely
impossible to really know error_!""Can you know that two plus two
equals seven?""Let me make this statement of truth: nothing can be known definitely
except as it is explained by the principle which governs it.Now what
principle governs an error, whether that error be in music,
mathematics, or life conduct?"And that
is why God--infinite Mind--can not behold evil.And now, friends, I
have come to the conclusion of a long series of deductions.If
infinite mind is the cause and creator, that is, the revealer, of all
that really exists, its suppositional opposite, its negative, must
likewise simulate a creation, or revelation, or unfolding, for this
opposite must of very necessity pose as a creative principle.It must
simulate all the powers and attributes of the infinite creative mind.If the creative mind gave rise to a spiritual universe and spiritual
man, by which it expresses itself, then this suppositional opposite
must present its universe and its man, opposite in every particular to
the reality._It is this sort of man and this sort of universe that
we, as mortals, seem to see all about us, and that we refer to as
human beings and the physical universe._ And yet, all that we see,
feel, hear, smell, or taste is the false, suppositional thought that
comes into our so-called mentalities, and by its suppositional
activity there causes what we call consciousness or awareness of
things.""Then," said Father Waite, more to enunciate his own thought than to
question the deduction, "what the human consciousness holds as
knowledge is little more than belief and speculation, with no basis of
truth, no underlying principle."And it brings out the fruits of such beliefs in discord,
decay, and final dissolution, called death.For this human consciousness
forms its own concept of a fleshly body, and a mind-and-matter man.It
makes the laws which govern its body, and it causes its body to obey
these false laws.Upon the quality of thought entering this human
consciousness depend all the phenomena of earthly life and environment
which the mortal experiences.The human consciousness, in other words,
is a _self-centered mass of erroneous thought, utterly without any basis
of real principle, but actively engaged in building up mental images,
and forming and maintaining an environment in which it supposes
itself to live_._This false thought in the human consciousness forms
into a false concept of man, and this is the soul-and-body man, the
mind-and-matter man, which is called a human being, or a mortal._"

"And there," commented Carmen, with a dreamy, far-away look, "we have
what Padre Jose so long ago spoke of as the 'externalization of
thought.'It is the same law which Jesus had in mind when he said, 'As
a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.'""For we know only what enters our mentalities and
becomes active there.And every thought that does so enter, tends at
once to become externalized.That is, there is at once the tendency
for us to see it visualized in some way, either as material object, or
environment, or on our bodies.And it is the very activity of such
thought that constitutes the human mentality, as I have already
said.""And that thought is continually changing," suggested Father Waite.Its very lack of true principle requires that it should
change constantly, in order to simulate as closely as possible the
real.That accounts for the fleeting character of the whole human
concept of man and the physical universe.The human personality is
never fixed, although the elements of human character remain; that is,
those elements which are essentially unreal and mortal, such as lust,
greed, hatred, and materiality, seem to remain throughout the ages.They will give way only before truth, even as Paul said.But not until
truth has been admitted to the human mentality and begins its solvent
work there, the work of denying and tearing down the false
thought-concepts and replacing them with true ones.""And will truth come through the physical senses?"Their supposed testimony is the material thought which enters
the human mentality and becomes active there, resulting in human
consciousness of both good and evil.And that thought will have to
give way to true thought, before we can begin to put off the 'old man'
and put on the 'new.'Human thoughts, or, as we say, the physical
senses, do not and can not testify of absolute truth.exclaimed Haynerd, rousing up."There goes the Church, and
original sin, and fallen man!""There is no such thing as 'fallen man,' my friend," said Hitt
quietly."The spiritual man, the image and likeness, the reflection,
of the infinite creative mind, is perfect as long as its principle
remains perfect--and that is eternally.He is a product of false, suppositional thought.He did not fall, because he has had no perfection
to lose."Reverend Patterson Moore, who had sat a silent, though not wholly
sympathetic listener throughout the discussion, could now no longer
withhold his protest."No wonder," he abruptly exclaimed, "that there
are so few deep convictions to-day concerning the great essentials of
Christianity!As I sit here and listen to you belittle God and rend
the great truths of His Christ, as announced in His Word, the Bible, I
am moved by feelings poignantly sorrowful!The Christ has once been
crucified; and will you slay him again?""No," said Carmen, her eyes dilating with surprise, "but we would
resurrect him!Don't you think you have kept him in the tomb long
enough?The Christ-principle is intended for use, not for endless
burial!"My dear Miss Carmen, it is I who preach the risen Christ!""And
because of centuries of such preaching the world has steadily sunk
from the spiritual to the material, and lip service has taken the
place of that genuine spiritual worship which knows no evil, and
which, because of that practical knowledge, heals the sick and raises
the dead.""No, I state facts," said Carmen."Paul made some mistakes, for he was
consumed with zeal.But he stated truth when he said that the second
coming of Christ would occur when the 'old man' was put off.We have
been discussing the 'old man' to-night, and showing how he may be put
off.Now do you from your pulpit teach your people how that may be
done?""I teach the vicarious atonement of the Christ, and prepare my flock
for the world to come," replied the minister with some heat."But I am interested in the eternal present," said the girl, "not in a
suppositional future.'I am that which is, and which was, and which is to come,' says
the infinite, ever-present mind, God!""I see no Christianity whatsoever in your speculative philosophy,"
retorted the minister."If what you say is true, and the world should
accept it, all that we have learned in the ages past would be blotted
out, and falsehood would be written across philosophy, science, and
religion.By wafting evil lightly aside as unreal, you dodge the
issue, and extend license to all mankind to indulge it freely.Evil is
an awful, a stupendous fact!And it can not be relegated to the realm
of shadow, as you are trying to do!""You know, Duns Scotus
said: 'Since there is no real being outside of God, evil has no
substantial existence.Perfection and reality are synonyms, hence
absolute imperfection is synonymous with absolute unreality.'And do you really think he looked upon
evil as a _reality_?""Then, if that is true," said the girl, "I will have to reject him.But come, we are right up to the point of discussing him and his
teachings, and that will be the subject of our next meeting.It is love, you know, that has drawn us all
together."It's an open forum, Moore," said the doctor, patting him on the back."Wisdom isn't going to die with you."I am quite well satisfied with my present one, Doctor," replied the
minister tartly."Well, then, come and correct us when we err.It's your duty to save
us if we're in danger, you know.""And now, Carmen, the piano awaits you.By
the way, what did Maitre Rossanni tell you?""Oh," replied the girl lightly, "he begged me to let him train me for
Grand Opera.""He said I would make a huge fortune," she laughed."I told him I carried my wealth with me, always, and that my fortune
was now so immense that I couldn't possibly hope to add to it."Hitt," she said, going to him and looking up into his
face, "I am too busy for Grand Opera and money-making.I couldn't be happy if I made people pay to hear
me sing."With that she turned and seated herself at the piano, where she
launched into a song that made the very Reverend Patterson Moore raise
his glasses and stare at her long and curiously.CHAPTER 7


Man reasons and seeks human counsel; but woman obeys her instincts.Her life had been one of utter freedom from
dependence upon human judgment.The burden of decision as to the
wisdom of a course of action rested always upon her own thought.Never
did she seek to make a fellow-being her conscience.When the day of
judgment came, the hour of trial or vital demand, it found her
standing boldly, because her love was made perfect, not through
instinct alone, but through conformity with the certain knowledge that
he who lacks wisdom may find it in the right thought of God and man.And so, when on the next day she joined Hitt and Haynerd in the office
of the Social Era, and learned that Carlson had met their terms,
eagerly, and had transferred to them the moribund Express, she had no
qualms as to the wisdom of the step which they were taking.Haynerd was a composite picture of doubt
and fear, as he sat humped up in his chair.Hitt was serious to the
point of gloom, reflecting in a measure his companion's dismal
forebodings."I was scared to death for fear he wouldn't sell," Haynerd was saying
as the girl entered; "and I was paralyzed whenever I thought that he
would."Carmen laughed aloud when she heard these words."Do you know," she
said, "you remind me of Lot's wife.She was told to go ahead, along
the right course.But she looked back--alas for her!Now you two being
started right are looking back; and you are about to turn to salt
tears!"Now listen," she continued, as Haynerd began to remonstrate; "don't
voice a single fear to me!You couldn't make me believe them true even
if you argued for weeks--and we have no time for such foolishness
now.The first thing that you have got to do, Ned, is to start a
little cemetery.In it you must bury your fears, right away, and
without any mourning.Put up little headstones, if you wish; but don't
ever go near the place afterward, excepting to plant the insults, and
gibes, and denouncements, and vilifications which the human mind will
hurl at you, once the Express starts out on its new career.Good is
bound to stir up evil; and the Express is now in the business of good.Remember, the first thing the Apostles always did was to be afraid.And they kept Jesus busy pointing out the nothingness of their
fears.""I guess we'll find
ourselves a bit lonely in it, too!""True, humanly speaking," replied the girl, taking a chair beside him."But, Ned, let me tell you of the most startling thing I have found in
this great, new country.It is this: you Americans have, oh, so much
animal courage--and so little true moral courage!You know that the
press is one of the most corrupt institutions in America, don't you?Going into thousands of homes every day, it is
a deadlier menace than yellow fever.You know that it is muzzled by
so-called religious bodies, by liquor interests, by vice-politicians,
by commercialism, and its own craven cowardice.And yet, Ned, despite
your heart-longing, you dare not face the world and stand boldly for
righteousness in the conduct of the Express!"Now," she went on hurriedly, "let me tell you more.While you have
been debating with your fears as you awaited Mr.Carlson's decision, I
have been busy.If I had allowed my mentality to become filled with
fear and worry, as you have done, I would have had no room for real,
constructive thought.But I first thanked God for this grand
opportunity to witness to Him; and then I put out every mental
suggestion of failure, of malicious enmity from the world, and from
those who think they do not love us, and with it every subtle argument
about the unpreparedness of the human mind for good.After that I set
out to visit various newspaper offices in the city.I have talked with
four managing and city editors since yesterday noon.I have their
viewpoints now, and know what motives animate them.I know, in part, what the Express will have to meet--and how to
meet it."Both men stared at her in blank amazement.Haynerd's jaw dropped as he
gazed.He had had a long apprenticeship in the newspaper field, but
never would he have dared attempt what this fearless girl had just
done."I have found out what news is," Carmen resumed."It is wholly _a
human invention_!It is the published vagaries of the carnal mind.In
the yellow journal it is the red-inked, screaming report of the
tragedies of sin.Fallom if he knew anything about mental
laws, and the terrible results of mental suggestion in his paper's
almost hourly heralding of murder, theft, and lust.But he only
laughed and said that the lurid reports of crime tended to keep people
alive to what was going on about them.He couldn't see that he was
making a terrible reality of every sort of evil, and holding it so
constantly before an ignorant, credulous world's eyes that little else
could be seen.The moral significance of his so-called news reports
had no meaning whatsoever for him!"asked Haynerd, not believing that she would
have dared visit that journalistic demon."Yes," answered the girl, to his utter astonishment.Adams said
he had no time for maudlin sentimentalism or petticoat sophistry.He
was in the business of collecting and disseminating news, and he
wanted that news to go _shrieking_ out of his office!You can see how the report of an Italian
wife-murder shrieks in red letters an inch high on the very first
page.Or has
he further prostituted journalism by this ignorant act?""The people want it, Carmen," said Hitt slowly, though his voice
seemed not to sound a real conviction."If the church and the
press were not mortally and morally blind, they would see the deadly
destruction which they are accomplishing by shrieking from pulpit and
sanctum: 'Evil is real!Pietro Lasanni cuts his wife's throat!"But, Carmen, while what you say is doubtless true, it must be
admitted that the average man, especially the day laborer, reads his
yellow journal avidly, and--"

"Yes, he does," returned the girl.The average man, as
you call him, is a victim of _the most pernicious social system
ever devised by the human mind_!Swept along in the mad rush of
commercialism, or ground down beneath its ruthless wheels, his
jaded, jarred nerves and his tired mind cry out for artificial
stimulation, for something that will for a moment divert his wearied
thought from his hopeless situation.The Church offers him little
that is tangible this side of the grave.But whiskey, drugs, and
yellow journalism do.Hitt--can't you, Ned--that
the world's cry for sensationalism is but a cry for something that
will make it forget its misery for a brief moment?The average man
feels the superficiality of the high speed of this century of mad
rush; he longs as never before for a foundation of truth upon which to
rest; he is tired of theological fairy-tales; he is desperately
tired of sin, and sickness, and dying.He cares little about a
promised life beyond the grave.He wants help here and now to solve
his problems.Little beyond a recount
of his own daily miseries, and reports of graft and greed, and
accounts of vulgar displays of material wealth that he has not and
can not have.And these reports divert his jaded mind for a moment and
give him a false, fleeting sense of pleasure--and then leave him
sunk deeper than before in despair, and in hatred of existing
conditions!""The girl is right," said Hitt, turning to Haynerd."And we knew it,
of course.This steam-calliope
age reflects the human-mind struggle for something other than its own
unsatisfying ideas.It turns to thrills; it expresses its restlessness
and dissatisfaction with itself by futurist and cubist art, so-called;
by the rattle and vibration of machinery; by flaring billboards that
insult every sense of the artistic; and by the murk and muck of yellow
journalism, with its hideous  supplements and spine-thrilling
tales.But the publisher himself--well, he
battens materially, of course, upon the tired victims of our degrading
social system.He sees but the sordid revenue in dollars and cents."And they can't," said Haynerd."Decent journalism wouldn't
pay--doesn't--never did!Other papers have tried it, and miserably
failed!""Then," returned Hitt calmly, after a moment's reflection, "oil will
meet the deficit.As long as my paternal wells flow in Ohio the
Express will issue forth as a clean paper, a dignified, law-supporting
purveyor to a taste for better things--even if it has to create that
taste.Its columns will be closed to salacious sensation, and its
advertising pages will be barred to vice, liquor, tobacco, and
drugs.""And now we've got to get right down to
business.""Just so," said Hitt, rising."It is my intention to issue the Express
one more week on its present basis, and then turn it into a penny
morning daily.I'm going to assume the management myself, with you, Carmen, as
my first assistant."But, first, how far may
I go?""The limit," replied Hitt, rubbing his hands together."You are my
brain, so to speak, henceforth.As to financial resources, I am
prepared to dump a hundred thousand dollars right into the Express
before a cent of revenue comes back.""Another question, then: will you issue a Sunday edition?""For a while, yes," he said."We'll see how it works, for I have some
ideas to try out.""Well, then," resumed the girl eagerly, "I want this paper to be for
_all_ the people; to be independent in the truest sense of the term;
and to be absolutely beyond the influence of political and religious
sectarianism--you'll soon enough learn what that will cost you--to be
an active, constructive force in this great city, and a patient,
tireless, loving educator."grunted Haynerd, although he was listening very carefully."The Express will succeed," the girl went on, without noticing him,
"because our thought regarding it is successful._We_ have already
succeeded; and that success will be externalized in our work.It makes
no difference what the people may think of _us_; but it makes a lot of
difference what _we_ think of _them_ and _ourselves_.We assume superiority over adverse conditions, and we
claim success, because we know that these things are mental, and that
they are divinely ours.Lot's wife didn't have the sort of confidence
that wins--she looked back.But
there is no doubt of the outcome.And so there is no doubt lurking in
us to take the edge off our efforts, is there?The thought regarding
the Express has not been timidly born within us; it has come forth
flashing vigor!Yes it has, Ned, despite your doubts!And we have
within us a power mightier than any force outside of us.That is the
knowledge of infinite mind's omnipotence, and our ability to use the
Christ-principle to meet _every_ problem.Haynerd began to rouse up with a returning sense of confidence.Hitt
smiled and nodded to Carmen.The girl went on rapidly and eagerly:

"We are going to give the people news from a new standpoint, aren't
we?We are not going on the assumption that the report of mankind's
errors is the report of real news.The only thing that is really new
is _good_.Adams's office two
items came in over the 'phone.One was the report of a jewel robbery,
and the other was an announcement of the draining by the Government of
submerged lands in Louisiana, so as to give an additional opportunity
to those seeking farms.Adams put in bold type on
the front page?I was unable to locate the latter
anywhere in the paper, although it was a timely bit of news.""Now another thing," continued the girl, "I want the Sunday edition of
the Express to contain a resume of the important and vital news of the
week, with the very clearest, most impartial and enlightening
editorial comment upon it.This calls for nice discrimination in the
selection of those items for our comment.It means, however, the best
practical education for the people.This was John Ruskin's idea, and
certainly is a splendid one.Still another thing, the Express will
stand shoulder to shoulder with the women for equal suffrage."It is the women who will clean up
and regenerate this world, not the men.Reform is now in the hands of
the women.And India proves that
backward women mean a backward nation.""Then," continued Carmen, "make a distinct Women's Department in the
Express, and put Miss Wall on the staff.""A daily educational department for foreigners, our immigrants, giving
them every possible aid in suggestions regarding their naturalization,
the languages, hotels, boarding houses, employment, and so on.""The Express is going to maintain a social service, and night schools.It is going to establish vacation and permanent homes for girls.It is
going to provide for vocational training.It is going to establish a
lecture bureau--for lectures on _good_.It is going to build a model
city for workingmen.Then it is going to found a model city for
everybody.It is going to establish clubs and meeting places for
workingmen, places where they may meet, and play games, and read, and
have social intercourse, and practical instruction.It is going to
establish the same for young boys.It is going to take the lead for
civic betterment in this city, and for child-welfare, and for--"

By this time Haynerd was sitting erect and staring in bewilderment at
the girl."Aren't you wandering
somewhat beyond strict newspaper limits?"And haven't I told you," returned the girl promptly, "that the only
thing new in this world is _good_?Our news is going to be _good_
news--the collection and dissemination of _good_ to all mankind.People who read our paper will no longer feel that it is dangerous to
be alive, but a glorious privilege.Hitt said I could go the limit, you know."Hitt had caught the girl's infectious enthusiasm, and his face was
beaming."It's your unlimited thought, Carmen, that
we old dry-bones want!What is anything in this life, compared with real
service to our fellow-men?_The Express is not in business to make
money!_ It is in the business of collecting and scattering the news of
good.Its dividends will be the happiness and joy it gives to mankind.For _good is the greatest success there
is_!"It is likely that Hitt did not catch the full meaning of the girl's
words; and it is certain that Haynerd did not.But her boundless
enthusiasm did penetrate in large degree into their souls, and they
ceased to insist on the query, Will it pay?The broader outlook was
already beginning to return profits to these men, as the newer
definition of 'news' occupied their thought.Seizing their hats, they bade Carmen go with them to inspect the plant
of the Express, and meet its staff."There's a question I'd like to ask," said Haynerd, as they pursued
their way toward their recent purchase."I want to know what our
editorial policy will be.Do we condone the offenses of our grafters
and spoilsmen by remaining silent regarding their crimes?"We will let their guilt expose and kill itself," quickly returned
Carmen.A few minutes later they entered the gloomy, dust-laden offices of the
Express.Hitt's spirits sank again as he looked about him.But Carmen
seemed to suffer no loss of enthusiasm.After a mental appraisal of
the dingy, uninviting environment she exclaimed: "Well, one nice thing
about this is that we don't have much to start with!"Hitt reflected upon her cryptical remark, and then laughed.It was evident that the sale of
his plant had removed a heavy load from his shoulders."My best reporter was out yesterday when you called," he said,
addressing Hitt."He--well, he was a little the worse for wear.Come into my office and I'll send for him."In a few minutes a tall, boyish fellow responded to the editor's
summons.He must have been well under twenty, thought Hitt, marveling
that so young a man should be regarded as Carlson's best news
gatherer.But his wonder grew apace when the editor introduced him as
Mr.The lad smiled pallidly, as he bent his gaze upon Carmen, and
addressed his reply to her."My governor," he said laconically.returned Haynerd, beginning to bristle.Carlson dismissed the reporter, and turned to the curious group."The boy has the making of a fine newspaper man in him.Has something
of his father's terrible energy.He used to come down here before his father threw him out.I
let him write little articles for the Express when he was barely
sixteen years old; and they were mighty good, too.But he got mixed up
in some scandal, and J. Wilton cut him off.The boy always did drink,
I guess.But since his family troubles he's been on the straight road
to the insane asylum."His father is no
friend of mine, and--"

"We _shall_ keep him," calmly interrupted Carmen."His father is a
_very_ good friend of mine."Carlson looked from one to the other quizzically."Well," squinting over his glasses at the girl, "this surely is
woman's era, isn't it?"*       *       *       *       *

A week later the Express, scarcely recognizable in its clean, fresh
type and modest headlines, with its crisp news and well written
editorials, very unostentatiously made its entry into the already
crowded metropolitan field.Adams picked it up and
laughed, a short, contemptuous laugh.Fallom glanced over it and
wondered.J. Wilton Ames, who had been apprised of its advent, threw
it into the waste basket--and then drew it out again.He re-read the
editorial announcing the policy of the paper.From that he began a
careful survey of the whole sheet.His eye caught an article on the
feminist movement, signed by Carmen Ariza.His lip curled, but he read
the article through, and finished with the mental comment that it was
well written."I want this sheet carefully watched," he commanded, tossing the paper
to his secretary."If anything is noticed that in any way refers to me
or my interests, call my attention to it immediately."A moment afterward Henry Claus,
nominal head of the great Claus brewing interests, was ushered in.cried the newcomer, rushing
forward and clasping the financier's hand."The city council last
night voted against the neighborhood saloon license bill!"Yes," commented the laconic Ames."Our aldermen are a very
intelligent lot of statesmen, Claus.They're wise enough to see that
their jobs depend upon whiskey.It requires very astute statesmanship,
Claus, to see that.But some of our congressmen and senators have
learned the same thing."The brewer pondered this delphic utterance and scratched his head."Well," continued Ames, "have you your report?""Sales
less than last month," he remarked dryly."It's the local option law what done it, Mr.Ames," replied the brewer
apologetically."Them women--"

"Bah!Let a few petticoats whip you, eh?But, anyway, you don't know
how to market your stuff.Look here, Claus, you've got to encourage
the young people more.We've got to get the girls and boys.If we get
the girls, we'll get the boys easily enough.It's the same in the
liquor business as in certain others, Claus, you've got to land them
young."Ames, I can't take 'em and pour it down their throats!""You could if you knew how," returned Ames.if I had
nothing else to do I'd just like to devote myself to the sales end of
the brewing business.I'd use mental suggestion in such a way through
advertising that this country would drown in beer!Beer is just plain
beer to you dull-wits.But suppose we convinced people that it was a
food, eh?Advertise a chemical analysis of it, showing that it has
greater nutriment than beef.Catch the clerks and poor stenographers
that way.Don't call it beer; call it Maltdiet, or something like
that.Why, we couldn't begin to supply the demand!""Billboards in every field and along all railroads and highways;
boards in every vacant lot in every town and city in the country;
electric signs everywhere; handbills; lectures--never thought of that,
did you?And samples--why, I'd put samples into every house in the
Union!I'd give away a million barrels of beer--and sell a hundred
million as a result!But I'd work particularly with the young people.Work on them with literature and suggestion; they're more receptive
than adults.The hypnotism that works through suggestive advertising,
Claus, is simply omnipotent!"We have all the papers, excepting the Express, Mr.You can
afford to pass it up.It's run by a college professor and a doll-faced
girl."Ames, our advertising manager tells me that the publishers
of the Express called a meeting of the managers of all the other city
papers, to discuss cutting out liquor advertising, and that since then
the rates have gone up, way up!You see, the example set by the
Express may--"

"Humph!"An example, backed by
absolute fearlessness--and he knew from experience that the publishers
of the Express were without fear--well, it could not be wholly
ignored, even if the new paper had no circulation worth the name.Ames," resumed the brewer, "the Express is in every newsstand in
the city.It's in every hotel, in every
saloon, in every store and business house here.It
isn't sold, it's given away!"Leave it to me, Claus," he said at length, dismissing the brewer."I'll send for you in a day or so."*       *       *       *       *

It was well after midnight when the little group assembled in the
dining room of the Beaubien cottage to resume their interrupted
discussions.Hitt and Haynerd were the last to arrive.With him had come, not without
some reluctance, his prickly disputant, Reverend Patterson Moore, and
another friend and colleague, Doctor Siler, whose interest in these
unique gatherings had been aroused by Morton."I've tried to give him a resume of our previous deductions," the
latter explained, as Hitt prepared to open the discussion."And he
says he has conscientious scruples--if you know what that means.""He's a Philistine, that's all, eh?""I am like my friend, Reverend Edward
Hull, who says--"

"There!""Your friend has a life job molding the
plastic minds of prospective preachers, and he doesn't want to lose
the sinecure.Got a wife and babies depending on
him.He still preaches hell-fire and the resurrection of the flesh,
doesn't he?Well, in that case we can dispense with his views, for
we've sent that sort of doctrine to the ash heap."Reverend Moore opened his mouth as if to protest; but Hitt prevented
him by taking the floor and plunging at once into his subject."The
hour is very late," he said in apology, "and we have much ground to
cover.Carmen stole a hand beneath the table and grasped the Beaubien's."As I sat in my office this morning," began Hitt meditatively, "I
looked often and long through the window and out over this great,
roaring city.Everywhere I saw tremendous activity, frantic hurry, and
nerve-racking strife.In the distance I marked the smoke curling
upward from huge factories, packing houses, and elevators.The
incessant seething, the rush and bustle, the noise, the heat, and
dust, all spelled business, an enormous volume of human business--and
yet, _not one iota of it contributed even a mite to the spiritual
nature and needs of mankind_!And then I looked down, far down, into the
streets below.And I saw,
too, men and women, rich and comfortable, riding along happily in
their automobiles, with not a thought beyond their physical
well-being.But, I asked myself, should they not ride thus, if they
wish?And yet, the hour will soon come when sickness, disaster, and
death will knock at their doors and sternly bid them come out."Just what I have sought to impress upon you whenever you advanced
your philosophical theories, Doctor," said Reverend Moore, turning to
Morton.The doctor glowered back at him without reply."Now what should the man in the automobile do?Is there anything he
_can_ do, after all?Jesus told such as he to seek
first the kingdom of harmony--a demonstrable understanding of truth.The automobile riding would follow after that, and with safety.Why,
oh, why, will we go on wasting our precious time acquiring additional
physical sensations in motor cars, amusement parks, travel, anywhere
and everywhere, instead of laboring first to acquire that real
knowledge which alone will set us free from the bitter woes of human
existence!""Jesus set us free, sir," interposed Reverend Moore sternly."And his
vicarious atonement opens the door of immortality to all who believe
on his name."Moore, you believe will be acquired only after
death.At present we see mankind laboring for that which even they
themselves admit is not meat.They waste their substance for what is
not bread.Because of their false beliefs of God and man,
externalized in a viciously cruel social system; because of their
dependence upon the false supports of _materia medica_, orthodox
theology, man-devised creeds, and human opinions."And yet, who hath believed our report?men in our
day think and read little that is serious; and they reflect hardly at
all upon the vital things of life.They want to be let alone in their
comfortable materialistic beliefs, even though those beliefs rend
them, rive them, rack and twist them with vile, loathsome disease, and
then sink them into hideous, worm-infested graves!The human mind does
not want its undemonstrable beliefs challenged.It does not want the
light of unbiased investigation thrown upon the views which it has
accepted ready-made from doctor and theologian.Because,
my friends, the human mind is inert, despite its seemingly tremendous
material activity.And its inertia is the result of its own
self-mesmerism, its own servile submission to beliefs which, as
Balfour has shown, have grown up under every kind of influence except
that of genuine evidence.Chief of these are the prevalent religious
beliefs, which we are asked to receive as divinely inspired."But that
gentleman sat stolid, with arms folded and a scowl upon his sharp
features."Religion," continued Hitt, "is that which binds us to the real.what a farce mankind have made of it.Because, in its mad
desire to make matter real and to extract all pleasures from it, the
human mind has tried to eliminate the soul.""We have been having a bad spell of materialism, that's true,"
interposed Doctor Morton."Well," Hitt replied, "perhaps so.Yet almost in our own day France
put God out of her institutions; set up and crowned a prostitute as
the goddess of reason; and trailed the Bible through the streets of
Paris, tied to the tail of an ass!And in this country we have enthroned so-called physical
science, and, as Comte predicted, are about to conduct God to the
frontier and bow Him out with thanks for His provisional services.As our droll philosopher, Hubbard, has said, 'Once
man was a spirit, now he is matter.Once he was a flame, now he is a
candlestick.Once he was a son of God, now he is a chemical formula.Once he was an angel, now he is plain mud.'""But," exclaimed Reverend Moore, visibly nettled, "that is because of
his falling away from the Church--"

"My friend," said Hitt calmly, "he fell away from the Church because
he could not stagnate longer with her and be happy.Orthodox theology
has largely become mere sentimentalism.The average man has a horror
of being considered a namby-pamby, religiously weak, wishy-washy,
so-called Christian.It makes him ashamed of himself to stand up
in a congregation and sing 'My Jesus, I love Thee,' and 'In
mansions of glory and endless delight.'And he is far more concerned about his little brick bungalow
and next month's rent than he is about celestial mansions.No; he leaves religion to women, whom he regards as the
weaker sex.He turns to the ephemeral wisdom of human science--and,
poor fool!Well, how
often nowadays do you hear the name of God on their lips?Is He ever the topic of conversation at
receptions and balls?No; that person was right who said that
religion 'does not rise to the height of successful gossip.'It
stands no show with the latest cabaret dance, the slashed skirt,
and the daringly salacious drama as a theme of discourse.Oh, yes,
we still maintain our innumerable churches.And, though religion is
the most vital thing in the world to us, we hire a preacher to talk
to us once a week about it!Would we hire men to talk once a week to
us about business?But religion is far, far less important to
human thought than business--for the latter means automobiles and
increased opportunities for physical sensation."Hitt," objected Doctor Siler, "I am sure this is not such a
godless era as you would make out.""We have many gods, chief of whom is matter.The
world's acknowledged god is not spirit, despite the inescapable fact
that the motive-power of the universe is spiritual, and the only
action is the expression of thought."But now," he continued, "we have in our previous discussions made
some startling deductions, and we came to the conclusion that there is
a First Cause, and that it is infinite mind.But, having agreed upon
that, are we now ready to admit the logical corollary, namely, that
there can be but _one_ real mind?For that follows from the premise
that there is but one God who is infinite.""We have but the one mind, God," he replied.Human men reflect the communal mortal
mind, which is the suppositional opposite of the divine mind that is
God.I repeat, the so-called human mind knows not God.It sees only its own interpretations of Him
and His manifestations."Well, they might be," suggested Doctor Siler."Well then," he said, "if you will not admit that all
things are mental--including the entire universe--you certainly are
forced to admit that your comprehension of things is mental.""Then you will likewise have to admit that you are not concerned with
_things_, but with your comprehension of things.""And so, after all, you deal only with mental things--and everything
is mental to you.""The Bible states clearly that He created _all_ things," returned that
gentleman a little stiffly."My friends," resumed Hitt very earnestly, "we are on the eve of a
tremendous enlightenment, I believe.And for that we owe much to the
so-called 'theory of suppositional opposites.'We have settled to our
satisfaction that, although mankind believe themselves to be dependent
upon air, food, and water for existence, nevertheless they are really
dependent upon something vastly finer, which is back of those things.That'something' we call God, for it is good.Matthew Arnold said that
the only thing that can be verified about God is that He is 'the
eternal power that makes for righteousness.'Very well, we are almost
willing to accept that alone--for that carries infinite implications.It makes God an eternal, spiritual power, omnipotent as an influence
for good.It makes Him the infinite patron, so to speak, of
right-thinking.So it makes Him
the sole creative force."But," he continued, "force, or power, is not material.God by very
necessity is mind, including all intelligence.And His operations are
conducted according to the spiritual law of evolution.Oh, yes,
evolution is not a theory, it is a fact.God, infinite mind, evolves,
uncovers, reveals, unfolds, His numberless eternal ideas.The greatest of these is the one that
includes all others and expresses and reflects Him perfectly.That is the man who was'made'--revealed, manifested--in
His image and likeness.There is no other image and likeness of God.Moreover, God has always existed, and always will.So His ideas,
including real man, have had no beginning.They were not created, as
we regard creation, but have been unfolded.But now we come to the peculiar part,
namely, the fact that _reality seems always to have its shadow in
unreality_.The magnet has
its opposite poles, one positive, the other negative.At the lowest ebb of the
world's morals appeared the Christ.The Christian religion springs
from the soil of a Roman Emperor's blood-soaked gardens.Errors hampering the solving of
mathematical problems.That
which stands the test of demonstration as to permanence, I say with
Spencer."And now we learn that it is the _communal mortal mind_ that stands as
the opposite and negative of the infinite mind that is God, and that
it is but a supposition, without basis of real principle or fact.It
has its law of evolution, too, and evolves its types in human beings
and animals, in mountain, tree, and stream.All material nature, in
fact, is but the manifestation, or reflection, of this communal mortal
mind."But, though God had no beginning, and will have no ending, this
communal mortal mind, on the contrary, did have a seeming beginning,
and will end its pseudo-existence.It seemingly
evolved its universe, and its earth as its lower stratum.It made its
firmament, and it gradually filled its seas with moving things that
manifested its idea of life.Slowly, throughout inconceivable eons of
time, it unrolled and evolved, until at last, through untold
generations of stupid, sluggish, often revolting animal forms, it
began to evolve a type of mind, a crude representation of the mind
that is God, and manifesting its own concept of intelligence."Now what was this communal mortal mind doing?Counterfeiting divine
mind, if I may so express it.But
types that were without basis of principle, and so they passed
away--the higher forms died, the lower disintegrated.Aye, death came
into the world because of sin, for the definition of sin is the
Aramaic word which Jesus used, translated '_hamartio_,' which means
'missing the mark.'Yes, sin came through Adam, for
Adam is the name of the communal mortal mind."Well, ages and ages passed, reckoned in the human mind concept of
time.The evolution was continually toward a higher and ever higher
type.Paleolithic man still died, because he did not have enough real
knowledge in his mortal mind to keep him from missing the mark.He
probably had no belief in a future life, for he did not bury his dead
after the manner of those who later manifested this belief.But, after
the lapse of centuries, Neolithic man was found manifesting such a
belief.This: the mortal mind was translating the
divine idea of immortality into its own terms and thus expressing it.The curtain began to rise upon what we call human
history.The idea of a power not itself began to filter through the
mist of mortal mind, and human beings felt its influence, the
influence that makes for righteousness.And then, at last, through the
mortal mind there began to filter the idea of the one God.The people
who best reflected this idea were the ancient Israelites.They called
themselves the 'chosen' people.Their so-called minds were, as Carmen
has expressed it, like window-panes that were a little cleaner than
the others.They let a bit more of the light through.God is light,
you know, according to the Scriptures.And little by little they began
to record their thoughts regarding their concept of the one God.And soon they were seeing their God
manifested everywhere, and hearing His voice in every sound of Nature.And thus began that strange and mighty
book, the Bible, _the record of the evolution of the concept of God in
the human mind_.""Do you mean to say that the Bible was not given by inspiration?""This filtering process that I have been speaking
about _is_ inspiration.Every bit of truth that comes to you or me
to-day comes by inspiration--the breathing in--of the infinite mind
that is truth."And so," he went on, "we have those reflections of the communal
mortal mind which we call the Israelites recording their thoughts and
ideas.Sometimes they recorded plain fact; sometimes they wrapped
their moral teachings in allegories and fables.Josephus says of Moses
that he wrote some things enigmatically, some allegorically, and the
rest in plain words, since in his account of the first chapter of
Genesis and the first three verses of the second he gives no hint of
any mystery at all.But when he comes to the fourth verse of the
second chapter he says Moses, after the seventh day was over, began
to talk philosophically, and so he understood the rest of the second
and third chapters in some enigmatical and allegorical sense.Quite
so, it appears to me, for the writer, whoever he was, was then
attempting the impossible task of explaining the enigma of evil, the
origin of which is associated always with the dust-man.""You deny the truth of the account of the creation as given in the
second chapter of Genesis, do you?""You deny
that man was tempted and fell?""Well," said Hitt, smiling, "of course there is no special reason for
denying that serpents may have talked, millions and millions of years
ago.In fact, they still have rudimentary organs of speech--as do most
animals.Snakes developed in the
Silurian Era, some twenty million years ago.In the vast intervening
stretch of time they may have lost their power to talk.But, as for
the second chapter of Genesis, Moses may or may not have written it.Indeed, he may not have written the first.The book of
Genesis shows plainly that it is a composite of several books by
various authors.I incline to the belief that some more materialistic
hand and mind than Moses's composed that second chapter.However that
may be, it is a splendid example of the human mind's crude attempt to
interpret the spiritual creation in its own material terms.It in a
way represents the dawning upon the human mind of the idea of the
spiritual creation.For when finite sense approaches the infinite it
must inevitably run into difficulties with which it can not cope; it
must meet problems which it can not solve, owing to its lack of a
knowledge of the infinite principle involved.That's why the world
rejected the first account of the creation and accepted the second,
snake-story, dust-man, apple tree, and all."exclaimed Haynerd, his eyes wide agape."You're like a
story-book!"We know that man appeared on this
earth in comparatively recent times.For millions and millions of
years before he was evolved animals and vegetables had been dying."Your difficulty arises from the fact that
we are accustomed to associate sin with human personality.But
remember, the physical universe has been evolved from the communal
mortal mind.It has been dying from
the very beginning of its seeming existence, for its seeming existence
alone is sin.The vegetables, the animals, and now the men, that have
been evolved from it, and that express it and reflect and manifest
it, must die, necessarily, because the so-called mind from which they
evolve is not based upon the eternal, immortal principle, God.And so
it and they miss the mark, and always have done so.You must cease to
say, Whose sin?Remember that the sin is inherent in the so-called
mind that is expressed by things material.The absence of the
principle which is God is sin, according to the Aramaic word,
translated '_hamartio_,' which Jesus used.The most lowly cell that
swam in the primeval seas manifested the communal mortal mind's sin,
and died as a consequence.""In other words, it manifested a supposition, as opposed to truth?""Its existence was quite suppositional," replied Hitt."It did not
manifest life, but a material sense of existence.And so the communal mortal mind,
so-called, determined these first lowly material and objective forms
of existence.They were its phenomena, and they manifested it.Different types now manifest it, after long ages.But all are equally
without basis of principle, all are subject to the mortal law that
everything material contains within itself the elements for its own
destruction, and all must pass away.In our day we are dealing with
the highest type of mortal mind so far evolved, the human man.He,
too, knows but one life, human life, the mortal-mind sense of
existence.His human life is demonstrably only a series of states of
material consciousness, states of thought-activity.The classification
and placing of these states of consciousness give him his sense of
time.The positing of his mental concepts give him his sense of space.His consciousness is a thought-activity, externalizing human opinions,
ideas, and beliefs, not based on truth.This consciousness--or
supposititious human mind--is very finite in nature, and so is
essentially self-centered.It attributes its fleshly existence to
material things.It believes that its life depends upon its fleshly
body; and so it thinks itself in constant peril of losing it.It goes
further, and believes that there are multitudes of other human minds,
each having its own human, fleshly existence, or life, and each
capable of doing it and one another mortal injury.It believes that it
can be deprived by its neighboring mortal minds of all that it needs
for its sustenance, and that it can improve its own status at their
expense, and vice versa.It is filled with fears--not knowing that God
is infinite good--and its fears become externalized as disaster, loss,
calamity, disease, and death at last.It has no basis of principle to rest upon, and so it
constantly shifts and changes to accord with its own shifting thought.It is here to-day, and gone
to-morrow.""Well, Ned," said Hitt, "there is this hope: human consciousness
always refers its states to something.It is infinite mind, God, and its infinite manifestation.The human
mind still translates or interprets God's greatest idea, Man, as 'a
suffering, sinning, troubled creature,' forgetting that this creature
is only a mental concept, and that the human mind is looking only at
its own thoughts, and that these thoughts are counterfeits of God's
real thoughts."Moreover, though the human mind is finite, and can not even begin to
grasp the infinite, the divine mind has penetrated the mist of error.There is a spark of real reflection in every mortal.That spark can be
made to grow into a flame that will consume all error and leave the
real man revealed, a consciousness that knows no evil.There is now
enough of a spark of intelligence in the human, so-called mind to
enable it to lay hold on truth and grow out of itself.And there is no
excuse for not doing so, as Jesus said.If he had not come we wouldn't
have known that we were missing the mark so terribly.""Well," observed Haynerd, "after that classification I don't see that
we mortals have much to be puffed up about!""All human beings, or mortals, Ned," said Hitt, "are interpretations
by the mortal mind of infinite mind's idea of itself, Man.These
interpretations are made in the human mind, and they remain posited
there.All are false,
and doomed to decay.How, then, can one mortal look down with
superciliousness upon another, when all are in the same identical
class?"Carmen's thoughts rested for a moment upon the meaningless existence
of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had anchored her life in the shifting
sands of the flesh and its ephemeral joys."Now," resumed Hitt, "we will come back to the question of progress.What is progress but the growing of the human mind out of itself under
the influence of the divine stimulus of demonstrable truth?And that
is made possible when we grasp the stupendous fact that the human,
mortal mind, including its man, is absolutely unreal and non-existent!The human man changes rapidly in mind, and, consequently, in its lower
stratum, or expression, the body.For that reason he need not carry
over into to-day the old, false beliefs which were manifested by him
yesterday.If he leaves them in the past, they cease to be manifested
in his present or future.Then, opening
himself to truth, he lays off the 'old man' and puts on the 'new.'He
denies himself--denies that there is any truth in the seeming reality
of the mortal, material self--as Jesus bade us do."His ideas and the thoughts regarding them must always have existed.He, as mind, is an inexhaustible
reservoir of thought.Now the human, mortal mind interprets His
thoughts, and so _seems_ to manufacture new thought.It makes new
interpretations, but not new thoughts.When you hear people chatting,
do you think they are manufacturing new thought?They
are but reflecting, or voicing, the communal so-called mortal mind's
interpretations of God's innumerable and real thoughts.""And so," suggested Father Waite, "the more nearly correct our
interpretations of His thoughts are, the nearer we approach to
righteousness.""There exist all sorts of real thoughts
about God's ideas.But the human mind
makes likewise all sorts of erroneous translations of them.We shall
solve our problem of existence when we correctly interpret His
thoughts, and use them only.When the human mentality becomes attuned
or accustomed to certain thoughts, that kind flow into it readily from
the communal mortal mind.Some people think for years along certain
erroneous or criminal lines.Their minds are set in that direction,
and invite such a flow of thought.But were they to reverse the'set,'
there would be a very different and better resulting externalization
in health, prosperity, and morals.""I think I see," said Miss Wall."And I begin to glimpse the true
mission of Jesus, and why he was ready to give up everything for it."And now a word further about the so-called mortal mind.For,
when we have collected and arranged all our data regarding it, we will
find ourselves in a position to begin to work out of it, and thereby
truly work out our salvation, even if with fear and trembling.I have
said in a previous talk that, judging by the deductions of the
physical scientists, everything seems about to leave the material
basis and turn into vibrations, and'man changes with velocity' of
these.They tell us that all life depends upon water; that life began,
eons ago, in the primeval sea.True, the human sense of existence, as
I have said, began in the dark, primeval sea of mist, the deep and
fluid mortal mind, so-called.And that sense of existence most
certainly is dependent upon the fluid of mortal mind.Bichat has said
that 'life is the sum of the forces that resist death.'Spencer has
defined life as the 'continuous adjustment of internal to external
relations.'Very good, as applied to the human sense of life.The
human mind makes multitudes of mental concepts, and then struggles
incessantly to adjust itself to them, and at length gives up the
struggle, hopelessly beaten.Scientists tell us that life is due to a
continuous series of bodily ferments.The body is in a constant state
of ferment, and that gives rise to life.We know that the human
mind is in a state of incessant ferment.The human mind is a
self-centered mass of writhing, seething, fermenting material thought.And that fermentation is outwardly manifested in its concept of body,
and its material environment.The scientists themselves are rapidly
pushing matter back into the realm of the human mind.Bodily states
are becoming recognized as manifestations of mental states--not vice
versa, as has been ignorantly believed for ages.A prominent physician
told me the other day that many a condition of nervous prostration now
could be directly traced to selfishness.We know that hatred and anger
produce fatal poisons.The rattlesnake is a splendid example of that.I am told that its poison and the white of an egg are formed of
_exactly the same amounts of the same elements_.The difference in
effect is the thought lying back of each.""You don't pretend that the snake
thinks and hates--"

"Doctor," said Hitt, "for thousands upon thousands of years the human
race has been directing hatred and fear-thoughts toward the snake.Is
it any wonder that the snake is now poisonous?That it now reflects
back that poisonous thought to mankind?""But some are not poisonous, you know.""Can we say how long they have not been so, or how soon our hatred
will make them all poisonous?Do you know, moreover, that sorrow,
remorse, all emotions, in fact, affect the perspiration that exudes
from the human body?Do you know that hatred will render human
perspiration the deadliest poison known to science?I am told that
in a few minutes of murderous hatred enough of this poisonous
perspiration is exuded from the human body to kill a man.And do
you know that the thought which manifests upon the body in such
deadly poison is just as deadly when sent into the mentality of a
human being?Think what the Church's deadly hatred of so-called
heretics has done in the last nineteen hundred years!Why, millions
have been killed by it alone!"But now," he said, consulting his watch, "I must go.Even a newspaper
man requires a little sleep.And I must make my apology for occupying
the floor to-night to the exclusion of you all.I have gradually been
filling up with these thoughts for some weeks, and I had to let them
out.Hitt," interrupted Father Waite, "I shall soon be ready to report
on those questions of Bible research which you assigned to me.""Well, have you found that Jesus really was
an historical character, or not?""I think," said Carmen, "that he has found that it really matters
little whether there ever was such a person as the human man Jesus.The Christ has always lived; and the Christ-principle which the man
Jesus is reported to have revealed to the world is with us, here, now,
and always.It is the principle, rather than the man Jesus, that
concerns us, is it not?""Miss Carmen," interposed Reverend Moore, "Jesus was the incarnate Son
of God, and your remarks concerning him are--"

"Slow up, Pat!""I'll fight that out with
you on the way home."We will take up that question in our next discussion," said Hitt."But, wait; Carmen must give us just a short song before we part."As she passed Hitt, she
squeezed his hand.A few minutes later the little group dispersed,
with the melody of the girl's voice trembling in their souls.CHAPTER 8


For several days Ames reflected, and waited.Judging by the data which
he was able to secure, the Express was eating up money at a fearful
pace.To continue at that rate meant certain financial disaster in the
near future.And yet the publishers of the rejuvenated sheet seemed
never to count the cost of their experiment.Already they had begun
the introduction of innovations that were startling and even
mirth-provoking to staid, conservative publishers in the journalistic
field.To survive the long period necessary for the education of the
public taste to such things as the Express stood for demanded a source
of income no less permanent than La Libertad itself.The Beaubien, of course, in her
crippled financial condition was affording the Express no monetary
assistance.Haynerd's few thousands were long
since dissipated.And
her estate was handled by Ames and Company!And handled, we may add,
in such a manner that Miss Wall knew naught regarding it, except that
she might draw upon it as one dips water from a hillside spring.And as he meditated upon the new paper and its
promoters, there gradually formed within him a consuming desire to see
again the fair young girl who had drawn him so strongly, despite his
mountainous wrath and his flaming desire to crush her when she boldly
faced him in his own house on the night of his grand reception.Why
had he let her escape him then?True, women had
meant little to him, at least in the last few years.But this girl had
seemed to stir within him new emotions, or those long slumbering.He
knew not, coarsely materialistic as was his current thought, that in
him, as in all who came within the radius of her pure affection, she
had swept chords whose music he had never heard before.And then one morning he took down
the receiver and called up the office of the Express.Hitt was not there--but this was his assistant.And:

"You didn't want to see Mr.Ames nearly dropped the receiver in his astonishment.In the first
place, the girl had read his thought; and in the second, he was not
accustomed to being told that he might go to see people--they came
cringing to him."You may come at twelve-fifteen," continued the clear, firm voice."And remain a half hour; I'm very busy."Ames put down the instrument and looked about, thankful that no one
was there to comment on his embarrassment.Then he leaned back in his
chair and went slowly over in thought the experiences of that eventful
night in his house.Why, this slip of a girl--a half-breed Indian at
best--this mere baby--!But he glanced up at the great electric wall
clock, and wished it were then twelve-fifteen.*       *       *       *       *

At noon Ames, jauntily swinging his light walking stick, strolled
casually into the office of the Express.His air was one of supreme
confidence in his own powers.And
the knowledge rendered him unafraid of God, man, or beast.He had met
and conquered everything mundane, excepting this young girl.But that
thought was now delightful to him.In her he had unearthed a real
novelty, a ceaseless interest.She scratched and nettled him; but she was as nothing in his grasp.The first thing that impressed him on entering the office was the air
of prosperity which hung over the place.The environment, he mentally
commented, was somewhat unusual for a newspaper plant.Order, quiet,
and cleanliness were dominant notes in the prevailing harmony.He
first walked back into the pressroom to see if the same conditions
prevailed there.Then he retraced his steps, and at length came to a
halt before a door bearing the inscription, "Miss Ariza," on the
glass.Turning the knob, he peered curiously in.The room was small, but light and airy.Its furnishings were new, and
its walls had been freshly tinted.A few pictures of good quality hung
about them.At the desk, bending
over a new typewriter, sat Carmen."I beg pardon," said Ames, hesitating in the doorway."You don't mind if I finish
this article, do you?""It's got
to go to the compositors right away.""Certainly--don't stop," replied Ames easily."When we talk I want
your undivided attention.""Oh, you're sure to get it," she returned, laughing.He sat back in his chair and watched her closely.Yet, there was just a slight tint in her skin, he thought.Perhaps the report that she was a mulatto was not wholly unfounded,
although the strain must have been greatly mixed.He wanted to bend over and take it in his own.Then he suddenly remembered what the Beaubien had once told him--that
she always seemed to be a better woman in this girl's presence.Could he go on persecuting the
harassed woman?But he wouldn't, if--

"There!"said the girl, with what seemed to be a little sigh of
relief.She pressed a button, and handed the typewritten sheets to the
boy who responded.Then, turning to Ames:

"You've come to apologize, haven't you?Well, he certainly had not had any such intention when he
came in.In fact, he knew not just why he was there."You see, Congressman Wales didn't vote for the unaltered schedule.And so everything's all right, isn't it?""No vote has been taken," he said, a dull anger
rising within him."Oh, you are mistaken," replied the girl."The bill was voted out of
committee an hour ago.Here's the wire,
showing the alterations made.Ames read the message, and handed it back.Beyond the clouding of his
features he gave no indication of his feelings."So, you see," continued the girl, "that incident is closed--for all
time, isn't it?"Then:

"Rather odd, isn't it?"he commented, turning quite away from that
subject, and glancing about, "that one with the high ideals you
profess should be doing newspaper work.""There is nothing so
practical as the ideal, for the ideal is the only reality.""Well, just what, may I ask, are you trying to do here?""Run a newspaper on a basis of _practical_ Christianity," she
answered, her eyes dancing."Just as all business will have to be
conducted some day."she said, "to the carnal mind."The laughter abruptly ceased, and he looked keenly at her.But there
was no trace of malice in her fair face as she steadily returned the
look.Well, I'll wager you won't get a dollar back on your investment
for years."We are not measuring our profits
in money!""And your investment--let's see," he mused, trying to draw her out."You've put into this thing a couple of hundred thousand, eh?""I'll tell you," she said, "because money is the only
measure you have for estimating the worth of our project.Hitt has
put more than that amount already into the Express."Quite a little for you people to lose, eh?""You will have to change your tone if you remain here, Mr.You who owe your fellow-men what you can
never, never repay?Ames, there is no man in this whole wide
world, I think, who is so terribly, hopelessly in debt as you!"Why, I don't owe a dollar to any man!"she queried, bending a little closer to him."You do not owe
Madam Beaubien the money you are daily filching from her?Gannette the money and freedom of which you robbed him?You do not owe anything to the thousands of miners and mill hands who
have given, and still give, their lives for you?You do not owe for
the life which you took from Mrs.You do not owe for
the souls which you have debauched in your black career?For the human
wreckage which lies strewn in your wake?Haynerd
for the Social Era which you stole from him?"Ames remained rigid and quiet while the girl spoke.And when she had
finished, and they sat looking squarely into each other's eyes, the
silence was like that which comes between the sharp click of lightning
and the crash of thunder which follows.If it had been a man who thus
addressed him, Ames would have hurled him to the floor and trampled
him.As it was, he rose slowly, like a black storm-cloud mounting
above the horizon, and stood over the girl.She looked up into his face dauntlessly and smiled."Sit down," she
quietly said.Don't threaten, please," she
continued."It wouldn't do any good, for I am not a bit afraid of you.A faint smile began to play about Ames's mouth.Then he twitched his
shoulders slightly."I--I got up," he said, with an assumption of
nonchalance, "to--to read that--ah, that motto over there on the
wall."He went slowly to it and, stooping, read aloud:

               "Lift up the weak, and cheer the strong,
               Defend the truth, combat the wrong!You'll find no scepter like the pen
               To hold and sway the hearts of men.""That was written by your Eugene Field," offered the girl."Now read
the one on the opposite side.It is your _Tekel Upharsin_."He went to the one she indicated, and read the spiritual admonition
from Bryant:

          "Leave the vain, low strife
          That makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power--
          The passions and the cares that wither life,
          And waste its little hour.""Now," continued the girl, "that is only a suggestion to you of the
real handwriting on the wall.I put it there purposely, knowing that
some day you would come in here and read it."Ames turned and looked at her in dumb wonder, as if she were some
uncanny creature, possessed of occult powers.Then the significance of
her words trickled through the portals of his thought."You mean, I suppose," he said, "that if I am not persuaded by the
second motto I shall feel the force of the first, as it sways you,
eh?"Ames," she replied steadily, "that the world is entering
upon a new era of thought, and that your carnal views and methods
belong to a day that is past.This century has no place for them; it
wearies of the things you represent; you are the epitome of that evil
which must have its little hour of night before the reality dawns.""Am I to understand," he
asked, "that the Express, under its new management, is about to turn
muck-raker, and shovel mud at us men of wealth?""We are not considering the Express now, Mr."It
is I alone who am warning you.""Do Hitt and Haynerd bring against me the charges which you voiced a
moment ago?And do you intend to make the columns of your paper spicy
with your comments on my character and methods?I verily believe you
are declaring war!""We are in the business of declaring truth, Mr.It will not shield you when
you are the willing tool of evil, nor will it condone your methods at
any price."Very well," he replied with a bantering smile."I came over
here this noon to get the policy of your paper.Ames," she returned, "is the challenge which evil
always finds in good."I like a good enemy, and an honest one.Who's your general, Hitt or Haynerd?"Then he recovered himself, and
laughed."Do you know," he said, bending close to her, "I admire you _very_
much.Now let's see if we can't get
together on terms of peace.The world hasn't used you right, and I
don't blame you for being at odds with it.I've wanted to talk with
you about this for some time.The pin-headed society hens got jealous
and tried to kill you.But, if you'll just say the word, I'll set you
right up on the very pinnacle of social prestige here.I'll take you
by the hand and lead you down through the whole crowd of 'em, and
knock 'em over right and left!I'll make you the leading woman of the
city; I'll back the Express; we'll make it the biggest newspaper in
the country; I'll make you and your friends rich and powerful; I'll
put you in the place that is rightfully yours, eh?He was bending ever nearer, and his hand closed over hers when he
concluded.His eyes were looking eagerly into her face, and a smile,
winning, enticing, full of meaning, played about his lips.Carmen returned his smile, but withdrew her hand."I'll join you," she
said, "on one condition.""Go; sell that thou hast; and give to the poor.Then come, take up the
cross, and follow--my leader."He straightened up, and a sneer curled his lips."I suppose," he
coarsely insinuated, "that you think you now have material for an
illuminating essay on my conversation."The man's facial muscles twitched slightly under the sting, but he
retained his outward composure."My dear girl," he said, "it probably
has not occurred to you that the world regards the Express as utterly
without excuse for existence.It says, and truly, that a wishy-washy
sheet such as it, with its devitalized, strained, and bolted reports
of the world's vivid happenings, deserves to go under from sheer lack
of interest.The experiment has been tried before, and has signally
failed.But, say the word,
and--"

"And your money, as well as your business ideals, will be ours?"Ames," she said, "you have no ideals.No man who amasses millions
by taking advantage of the world's inhuman and pernicious social
system can have ideals worthy of the name.To apply your methods, your
thought, to the Express would result in sinking its moral tone into
the dust.As for your money--"

"Commit suicide, then!"cried the man, yielding to his rising anger."Let the Express go down, carrying you and your spineless associates
with it!But, remember, you will be the sole cause of its ruin, and
theirs!"Carmen rose quietly and opened the office door."Your half hour is up,
Mr.Ames," she said, glancing at the little clock on her desk; "and I
must return to my work."For a moment the huge man stood looking down darkling upon the girl.He would have given his soul if he could have clasped that slender
form in his arms!A sudden impulse assailed him, and bade him fall
upon his knees before her, and ask her forgiveness and guidance.She
stood waiting--perhaps just for that, and always with that same smile
into which no one had ever yet read aught but limitless love.Carmen hastened to answer the call.Yes--yes--the cotton schedule was reported out
quite changed--yes, an hour ago!"*       *       *       *       *

"Dearie," said the Beaubien at evening, as Carmen seated herself in
that woman's lap and wound her arms about her neck, "I am afraid for
you.""Well, mother dearest," replied the girl, giving her a tighter
squeeze, "that is a sheer waste of time.If you haven't anything more
to occupy you than fear, you'd better come down to the office, and
I'll set you to work.""But--you have defied him--as he says, declared war--"

"No, dearest, not that.It is the carnal mind, using him as a channel,
that has declared war against good.But evil is not power; nor has it
been given power by God.My one thought is this: Am I doing that which
will result in the greatest good to the greatest number?Not as evil would
want to be served, but as good.If my mental attitude is right, then
God's law becomes operative in all that I do, and I am protected."I know, dearie, but--there's the telephone!Oh, I do hope they don't
want you!"Carmen answered the call, and returned with the announcement that
Haynerd was in distress."Sidney Ames is--not there," she said.Now don't worry,
dearest; I--I won't go alone."A moment later she gave the
Beaubien a kiss, and hurried out into the night.In half an hour she
stood at Haynerd's desk."Here I
am, tied down, depending on Sid, and he's drunk!"Haynerd looked up at her, and hesitated."Mass meeting, over on the
East Side.Here's the address," taking up a slip of paper."Open
meeting, I'm told; but I suspect it's an I. W. W. affair.he
said, replying to a telephone call.The Ames mills at
Avon closed down this afternoon?He hung up the receiver and turned to Carmen."That's what this
meeting is about," he said significantly."Four thousand hands
suddenly thrown out at the Avon mills.Sidney Ames slouched into the editor's office and sank heavily into a
chair."Look here," he said, in
sudden desperation, "that fellow's got to be sobered up, now!Or
else--"

Another call came, this time from the Beaubien.Haynerd eagerly gave the
address over the 'phone, and bade him start at once."Now," he said, nodding at Carmen, and jerking his thumb over his
shoulder toward the intoxicated reporter, "it's up to you."Carmen rose at once and went to the lad."Come, Sidney," she said,
taking his hand.The boy roused dully, and shuffled stupidly after the girl into her
own little office.Carmen switched on the lights and closed the door.Then she went to
the limp, emaciated form crumpled up in a chair, and sat down beside
it."Sidney," she said, taking his hand, "there is but one habit--the
habit of righteousness.That is the habit that you are going to wear
now."Outside, the typewriters clicked, the telephones tinkled, and the
linotypes snapped.There were quick orders; men came and went
hurriedly; but there was no noise, no confusion.Haynerd toiled like a
beaver; but his whole heart was in his work.Carmen's little room voiced the sole discordant note that night.And
as the girl sat there, holding the damp hand of the poor victim, she
thanked her God that the lad's true individuality was His pure
thought of him.*       *       *       *       *

At dawn Sidney Ames awoke.A rosy-tinted glow lay over the little
room, and the quiet form at his side seemed an ethereal presence.A
gentle pressure from the hand that still clasped his brought a return
of his earthly sense, and he roused up.The gentle voice sounded to him like distant music."I--you--you brought me in here last night--but--" His hands closed
about the little one that lay in his grasp."You--haven't sat
here--with me--all night?"With a low moan the boy buried his face in her arms, and burst into a
flood of bitter tears."It isn't real, Sidney," she whispered, twining an arm about his neck.For some moments the lad sobbed out his shame and misery.Carmen
stroked his fair hair, and drew him closer to her, while tears of love
and pity coursed down her own cheeks.he cried,
struggling to his feet, while his eyes shone with a wild light.He started for the door, but Carmen darted past him and stood with her
back against it, facing him.she cried, holding her
hands against him._God reigns
here!_"

She turned the lock as he hesitated; then took his arm and led him,
trembling and shivering, back to his chair."We are going to meet this, Sidney, you and I," she whispered, bending
over the shaking form.The suffering lad shook his head and buried his face in his hands."You can't," he moaned; "you can't--I'm _gone!_" His voice died into a
tremble of hopeless despair, of utter surrender.She had faced many trying situations in her brief
life-experience; but, though she met it with dauntless courage and
knew its source, the insidious suggestion now persisted that the eyes
of her people were upon her, and that by this would stand or fall
their faith.Aye, the world was watching her now, keen-eyed and
critical.Would she give it cause to say she could not prove her faith
by her works?And then came the divine message that bade her "Know that I am
God!"--that bade her know that responsibility lay not upon her
shoulders, but upon the Christ for whom she was now called to
witness.To see, or permit the world to see, this mountainous error,
this heaped-up evil, as real and having power, meant a denial of the
Christ and utter defeat.It meant a weary retracing of her own steps,
and a long night of spiritual darkness to those whose eyes had been
upon her."Sidney," she said, turning to the sunken boy at her side, "you are
right, the old man _is_ gone.And now we are going to create 'new
heavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered nor
come into mind'--as thought.Underneath are the everlasting arms, and
you have sunk down, down, down, until at last you rest upon them, and
you find that you haven't sunk at all, and that you couldn't possibly
get away from that infinite Love that is always drawing you to
itself!"She put her arm again about the lad, and drew him toward her."Listen,
Sidney dear, I am standing with you--and with me is omnipotent God!His arm is not shortened, that it can not save you from the pit of
spiritual oblivion into which human thought would seem to make you
think you had fallen, engulfed by the senses."The boy raised his head and looked at her through his bloodshot eyes.he whispered hoarsely; "you don't understand--"

"It is just because I _do_ understand, Sidney, that I am able to help
you," she interrupted quickly."It--it isn't only whiskey--it's--" his head sank again--"it's--morphine!"It's got the false thought that seems to call itself 'you,'" she
said.We'll
cling to them no longer, but shake them off for good.For good, I
said, Sidney--and that means, for _God_!"If there were a God, I shouldn't be
where I am now.""Then I will know it for you," she softly answered."And you are now
right where you belong, in Him.My
parents didn't teach it to their children.And when I tried to learn,
my father kicked me into the street!""Then, Sidney, I'll teach you.For I am in the world just to show what
love will do.""My father--it's his fault--all his fault!"cried the boy, flaring up
and struggling to rise.It's his fault
that I'm a sot and a drug fiend!""It is hate, Sidney, that manifests in slavery, in sodden brains, and
shaking nerves.You don't hate your father; the hate is against your
thought of him; and that thought is all wrong."I used to drink--some, when I lived at home," the boy went on, still
dwelling on the thoughts that held him chained."But he could have
saved me.And then I fell in love--I thought it was love, but it
wasn't.The woman was--she was years older than I. When she left the
city, I followed her.And when I found out what she was, and came back
home, my father threw me out--cut me off--God!""Never mind, Sidney," the girl whispered.But
she realized that the boy must voice the thoughts that were tearing
his very soul, and she suffered him, for it uncovered to her the
hidden sources of his awful malady."And then I drank, drank, drank!""And I lay in the
gutters, and in brothels, and--then, one day, Carlson told me to come
and work for him.And so I went to a
doctor, and he--God curse him!--he injected morphine into my arm to
sober me.And that taught me that I could drink all I wanted to, and
sober up on morphine.But then I learned--I found--"

He stopped, and began to fumble in his pockets.His eyes became wilder
as he searched.He caught her wrist and twisted
it painfully."I am not
afraid to see evil seem to have power!"Then aloud: "I know what you
are searching for, Sidney.Listen, and I will give it
to you.It is in love--right here--the Christ-principle, that is bigger far
than the demons that seem to tear you!I have _all_ power from God,
and you, evil, _can not touch me_!"The boy started at the ringing voice, and loosened his grasp.Then he
sank back into his chair, shaking as with palsy.We
don't have to struggle--we don't have to fight--we only have to
_know_.All that you are wrestling with is the world-wide belief that
there is a power apart from God!_There is none!_ Any claim that there
is such a power is a lie!There is no power or intelligence in whiskey or morphine!The Christ-principle will save you!There
is nothing beyond its reach, not even your problem!"It is a problem, that's all, Sidney," she went on, as he became
calmer.Will you put yourself in my charge,
in my care, and let me meet it for you?"She bent over him and looked
eagerly into his drawn face."We are not going to fight," she continued."We are not going to
resist evil as the world does, and so make it real.I know, dear, just
how pressing your need is.I know how
awfully real it seems to you.But trust me, as I trust the Christ.For a few moments they sat together, hand in hand."I am going to
take you home with me.I am going to keep you right with me, right
under my thought.I'm going to be the mirror, constantly with you,
that reflects infinite love to you every moment.Don't think of anything
else now, excepting that God has your hand and is leading you."She took his arm and drew him, unresisting, yet uncomprehending, to
the door.As she opened it, she looked up into his face and smiled.she cried, shifting her grasp to his hand.And I shall not turn you over to yourself again until the problem
is solved!"Hitt met them as they came out of the room."Well," he said, "I've
kept Madam Beaubien informed as well as I could."We'll be back at three--perhaps."*       *       *       *       *

But at three that afternoon the Beaubien telephoned to Hitt that
Carmen would not be down."She will not leave the boy," the woman said."She holds him--I don't
know how.And I know he is trying desperately to help her.But--I
never saw any one stand as she does!Lewis is here, but he doesn't
interfere.We're going to put a bed in his room, and Sidney will sleep
there.Haynerd stormed; but the tempest was all on the surface."I know, I
know," he said, in reply to Hitt's explanation."That boy's life is
more to her than a million newspapers, or anything else in the
universe just at present.The devil can't look her in the
face!I--I wish I were--What are you standing there for?In the little Beaubien cottage that afternoon the angry waves of human
fear, of human craving, of hatred, wrath, and utter misery mounted
heaven-high, and fell again.As the
night-shadows gathered, Sidney Ames, racked and exhausted, fell into a
deep sleep.Then Carmen left his bedside and went into the little
parlor, where sat the Beaubien and Father Waite."Here," she said, handing a hypodermic needle and a vial of tablets to
the latter.And now," she continued, "you must
work with me, and stand--firm!Sidney's enemies are those of his own
mental household.We have got to
uproot from his consciousness the thought that alcohol and drugs are a
power.Hatred and self-condemnation, as well as self-love, voiced in a
sense of injury, are other mental enemies that have got to be driven
out, too.It is all mental, every
bit of it!You have got to know that, and stand with me.We are going
to prove the Christ-principle omnipotent with respect to these seeming
things."But," she added, after a moment's pause, "you must not watch this
error so closely that it can't get away.For if
you do, you make a reality of it--and then, well--"

"The case is in your hands, Carmen," said Father Waite gently."We
know that Jesus would cure this boy instantly, if he were here--"

"Well--the Christ _is_ here!""Put
away your 'ifs' and 'buts.'"And these," he said, holding out the
needle and vial, "shall we have further use for them?""It will be given us what we are to do and say," she returned.CHAPTER 9


Four weeks from that crisp morning when Carmen led the bewildered,
stupified lad to her home, she and Sidney sat out upon the little
porch of the cottage, drinking in the glories of the winter sun.January was but half spent, and the lad and girl were making the most
of the sudden thaw before the colder weather which had been predicted
might be upon them.What these intervening weeks had been to Carmen, none might have
guessed as she sat there with the sunlight filtering in streamlets of
gold through her brown hair.But their meaning to the boy might have
been read with ease in the thin, white face, turned so constantly
toward his fair companion.They were deeply, legibly written there,
those black nights, when he would dash out into the hall, determined
to break through the windows of the nearest dram shop and drink,
drink, drink, until the red liquor burst from his eyes, his mouth, his
nostrils!Those ghastly nights, when Carmen would stand before him,
her arms outspread across the door, and beat back the roaring devils
within him!Those long days of agonized desire for the vicious drug
which had sapped his manhood!Those fell hours, when low curses poured
from his burning lips upon her and upon all mankind!Those cold,
freezing sweats, and the dry, cracking fever!Those hours when, with
Carmen always by his side, he tramped mile after mile through drifts
and ice, until he dropped at length from sheer exhaustion, only to
awake, hours later, to find that the girl had brought him home, safe,
unharmed!--

And then, oh, the "Peace, be still!"which he began to hear, faint at
first, but growing in volume, until, at last, it became a mighty,
thunderous command, before which the demons paled and slunk away,
never to return!Oh, the tears of agony that had given way to tears of
joy, of thanksgiving!Oh, the weakness that had been his strength!And, oh, the devotion of this fair girl--aye, and of her associates,
too--but all through her!Had she proved her God before the eyes of
the world?Day after day, clad in the impenetrable armor
of her love, she had stood at this struggling lad's side, meeting the
arrows of death with her shield of truth!Night after night she had
sat by his couch, her hand crushed in his desperate grasp, flouting
the terror that stalked before his delirious gaze!What work she had
done in those long weeks, none would ever know; but the boy himself
knew that he had emerged from the valley of the shadow of death with a
new mind, and that she had walked with him all the dark, cloud-hung
way.As they sat there in the bright sunlight that morning, their thought
was busy with the boy's future.Old plans, old ambitions, had seemed
to lift with the lifting of the mortal curse which had rested upon
him, and upward through the ashes of the past a tender flower of hope
was pushing its way.The last tie which
bound him to his family had been severed by his own father two weeks
before, when the shadow of death fell athwart his mother's brilliant
path.J. Wilton Ames, delicate in health when recalled from
abroad, and still suffering from the fatigue of the deadly social
warfare which had preceded her sudden flight from her husband's
consuming wrath, had failed to rally from the indisposition which
seized her on the night of the grand Ames reception.For days she
slowly faded, and then went quickly down under a sharp, withering
attack of pneumonia.A few brief weeks after the formal opening of the
Ames palace its mistress had sighed away her blasted hopes, her vain
desires, her petty schemes of human conquest and revenge, and had gone
to face anew her problems on another plane of mortal thought.It was
rumored by the servants that, in her last hours, when she heard the
rustle of the death angel's wings beside her, a great terror had
stricken her, and she had called wildly for that son whom she had
never cared to know.It was whispered that she had begged of her
husband to seek the lad and lead him home; that she had pleaded with
him to strive, with the boy, to find the better things of life; that
she had begged him to warn and be warned of her present sufferings, as
she lay there, stripped of every earthly aid, impoverished in heart,
in soul, in mind, with her hands dusty and begrimed with the ashes of
this life's mocking spoils.What truth lay hidden in her mad ravings about the parentage of
Carmen, and her confused, muttered references to Monsignor Lafelle, no
one knew.But of those who stood about her bedside there was none who
could gainsay the awed whisperings of the servants that this haughty
leader of the great city's aristocracy had passed from this life into
the darkness beyond in pitiable misery and terror.The news of his mother's death had come at a time when the boy was
wild with delirium, at an hour when Waite, and Hitt, and Carmen stood
with him in his room and strove to close their ears against the
shrieking of the demon that was tearing him.Hitt at once called up
Willett, and asked for instructions.A few minutes later came the
message that the Ames house was forever barred against the wayward
son.And it was not until this bright winter morning, when the lad
again sat clothed and in his right mind, that Carmen had gently broken
the news to him."I never knew her," the boy had said at length, rousing from his
meditations."Few of the rich people's children know their parents.I
was brought up by nurses and tutors.I never knew what it was to put
my arms around my mother, and kiss her.And often I would plan to surprise her by suddenly running into her
arms and embracing her.But then, when I would see her, she was always
so far away, so cold, so beautifully dressed.And she seldom spoke to
me, or to Kathleen, until we were grown up.And by that time I was
running wild.And then--then--"

"There!"admonished Carmen, reaching over and taking his hand."That's
in our little private cemetery, you know.The old error is dead, and
we are not going to dig it up and rehearse it, are we?""I'm like a little baby," he said sadly."I'm just
beginning to live.And you are my mother, the only one I've ever
known.""Let me be your sister," she said."We are so
near of an age, you know.""You are my angel," he murmured."What have I told you
so often that Jesus said?'Of mine own self I can do nothing.'It was--" her voice sank to a whisper--"it was the
Christ-principle.It worked through him as a channel; and it worked
through me.""You're going to teach me all about that," he said, again pressing her
hand to his lips."You won't cast me adrift yet, will you, little
sister?"Why, you're still mine, you
know!I haven't given you back to yourself yet, have I?But now let's
talk about your work.If you want to write, you are going to, and you
are going to write _right_.""Back to the Express," she said lightly."I haven't written a word for
it now for a month.And how dear, funny old Ned has scolded!""You--you dropped everything--your work--all--for a poor, worthless
hulk like me," he sighed."Sidney dear," the girl replied.Everything I do is '_as unto Him_.'I would have done the same for
anybody, whether I knew the person or not.I saw, not you, but the
human need--oh, such a need!And the Christ-principle made me a human
channel for meeting it, that is all.Drop my work, and my own
interests!Why, Sidney, what is anything compared with meeting human
needs?Didn't Jesus drop everything and hurry out to meet the sick and
the suffering?Was money-making, or society, or personal desire, or
worldly pleasure anything to him when he saw a need?You don't seem to
understand that this is what I am here for--to show what love will
do.""I--I guess I know only the world's idea of love.""And that is love's counterfeit, self-love, sentimentalism,
sex-mesmerism, and all that," she added."But now, back to your work
again.You're going to write, write, write!My, but the world is
hungry for _real_ literature!Your yearning to meet that need is a
sign of your ability to do it.But, remember, everything that comes to
you comes from within.You are, in fact, a miner; and your mine is
your mind; and that is unlimited, for God is the only mind, infinite
and omnipresent.We
never fear a real thing; we fear only our false thoughts of things.Always those thoughts are absolutely wrong, and we wake up and find
that we were fearing only fear-thoughts themselves.Now destroy the chains of fear which limit your thought,
and God will issue!"Well," without waiting for his reply, "now you have reached that
plane of thought where you don't really care for what the world has to
offer you.You have ceased to want to be rich, or famous.You are not
afraid to be obscure and poor.You have learned, at least in part,
that the real business of this life lies in seeking good, in
manifesting and expressing it in every walk, and in reflecting it
constantly to your fellow-men.Having learned that, you are ready to
live.Remember, there is no luck, no such thing as chance.The cause
of everything that can possibly come to you lies within yourself.The thought that you allow to enter
your mentality and become active there, later becomes externalized.Be, oh, so careful, then, about your thought, and the basis upon which
it rests!For, in your writing, you have no right to inflict false
thought upon your credulous fellow-mortals.""But," he replied, "we are told that in literature we must deal with
human realities, and with things as they are.The human mind exists,
and has to be dealt with.""The human mind does not exist, Sidney, except as supposition.The world still awaits the one who will show
it things as they _really_ are.Human realities, so-called, are the
horrible, ghastly unrealities of carnal thought, without any basis of
the divine Christ-principle.I know, we are told that the great books
of the world are those which preserve and interpret its life.is
it true greatness to detail, over and over again in endless recital,
the carnal motives of the human mind, its passions and errors, its
awful mesmerism, its final doom?Yes, perhaps, on one condition: that,
like a true critic, you picture human concepts only to show their
unreality, their nothingness, and to show how they may be overcome.""But most books--"

"Ah, yes, most books are written only to amuse the dispirited human
mind for a brief hour, to make it forget for a moment its troubles.They are literary narcotics; they are sops to jaded appetites, that's
all.A book, for example, that pictures an injured man discovering a
great treasure, and then using it to carry out his schemes of
revenge--well, what influence for good has such a work?It is only a
stimulus to evil, Sidney.But had it shown him using that great wealth
to bless his persecutors and turn them from their mesmerism to real
life and good--"

"Such things don't happen in this world, Carmen.""But they could, and should, Sidney dear.Then will come the new literature, the literature of _good_!And it
will make people think, rather than relieve them from the ennui of
solid thought, as our present novels do.The intellectual palate then
will find only insipidity in such books as pour from our presses now.The ability to converse glibly about authors who wallow in human
unrealities will then no longer be considered the hall-mark of
culture.Culture in that day will be conformity to truth.""Little sister," he said,
"you are a beautiful idealist.""But," came her quick reply, "are you not a living illustration of the
practicability of my idealism, Sidney?"The boy choked, and tears filled his eyes.Carmen stole an arm about
him."The most practical man who ever lived, Sidney dear, was Jesus.He had ideas that differed very
radically from other people's, but he did not hide them for fear of
giving offense.He was not afraid to shock people with the truth about
themselves.He tore down, yes; but he then reconstructed, and on a
foundation of demonstrable truth.He was not afraid to defy the
Rabbis, the learned, and the puffed-up.He did not bow abjectly before
the mandarins and pedagogues.Had he done so, and given the people
what they wanted and were accustomed to, they would have made him a
king--and his mission would have been a dead failure!""And for that they slew him," returned the boy."It is the cowardly fear of slaughter, Sidney, that keeps people from
coming out and standing for what they know to be right to-day.You are
not one of those cravens.""But the people who do that, Carmen, are called demagogues and
muck-rakers!""And the muck-rakers, Sidney, have made a sorry mess,
haven't they?They destroy without ruth, but seldom, if ever, put
forth a sane suggestion for the betterment of conditions.They traffic
in sensationalism, carping criticism, and abuse.'To find fault,' said
Demosthenes, 'is easy, and in every man's power; but to point out the
proper remedy is the proof of a wise counselor.'The remedy which I
point out, Sidney, is the Christ-principle; and all I ask is that
mankind seek to demonstrate it, even as Jesus bade us do.He was a
success, Sidney, the greatest success the world has ever known.Because he followed ideals with utter loyalty--because he voiced
truth without fear--because he made his business the service of
humanity.He took his work seriously, not for money, not for human
preferment, but for mankind.And his work bears the stamp of
eternity.""You're _not_ afraid, Sidney!""Oh, why
does the human mind always look for and expect that which it does not
want to see come or happen!"The boy laughed heartily at the quick sally of her delightfully
quotidian thought."You didn't let me finish," he said."I was going
to say that I'm afraid if I write and speak only of spiritual things I
shall not be understood by the world, nor even given a hearing.""Well, don't use that word 'afraid.'how the human mind clings to
everything, even words, that express its chief bogy, fear."And yet, has anything, written or
spoken, ever endured as his spiritual teachings?The present-day novel
or work of fiction is as fleeting as the human thought it attempts to
crystallize.Of the millions of books published, a handful endure.Those are they which illustrate the triumph of good over evil in human
thought.And the greatest of such books is the Bible.""Well, I'm hunting for a subject now."It will drive you to the task of transcribing it.Sidney--perhaps I can give you the subject!Perhaps I am the channel for this, too!""Well," bending over closer to her,
"what is it, little sister?"The girl looked out over the dripping shrubs and the soft snow.She saw a man, a priest, she knew not
where, but delving, plodding, digging for the truth which the human
mind has buried under centuries and centuries of material _debris_.She saw him, patiently bearing his man-made burden, striving to shield
a tender, abandoned girl, and to transfer to her his own great worldly
knowledge, but without its dross.She saw the mighty sacrifice, when
the man tore her from himself, and thrust her out beyond the awful
danger in which he dwelt.It was love--aye, the love that alone makes men great, the love
that lays down human life in self-immolating service.I will tell
you the whole beautiful story.It is an illustration of the way love
works through human channels.And perhaps--perhaps, some day, the book
may reach him--yes, some day.And it will tell him--oh, Sidney, it
will tell him that I know, and that I love him, love him, love him!"*       *       *       *       *

In the office of the manager of the Express three heads were close
together that morning, and three faces bore outward evidence of the
serious thought within."Miss Wall tells me, Ned," Hitt was saying, "that her father used to
be associated with Ames, and that, at his demise, he left his estate,
badly entangled, for Ames to settle.Now it transpires that Ames has
been cunning enough to permit Miss Wall to draw upon his bank almost
without limit, he making up any deficit with his own personal notes.""I think I see the shadow of his fine hand!""And now," resumed Hitt, "she is given to understand that Ames has
been obliged by the bank examiner to withdraw his personal notes as
security for her deficits, and that the revenue from her estate must
be allowed to accrue to the benefit of the Ames bank until such time
as all obligations are met.""In other words, Elizabeth is simply
cut off!"And now, another thing: Madam Beaubien's lawyer called on
her to-day, and informed her that Hood had gone into court and secured
an injunction, tying up all revenue from her estate until it can be
unraveled."Ames is out to do up
the Express, eh?""There is no doubt of it, Ned," returned Hitt seriously."And to
utterly ruin all connected with it.""Then, by God, we'll fight him to the last ditch!""I think you forget, Ned, that we have a lady with us," nodding toward
Miss Wall, "and that you are seriously trying to reform, for Carmen's
sake.""I beg your pardon, Elizabeth," said Haynerd meekly."I really am
trying to be decent, you know.But when I think of Ames it's like a
red rag to a bull!""Of course," Hitt continued, "oil still flows from our paternal wells.But in order to raise money at once I shall be obliged either to sell
my oil holdings or mortgage them.They have got to take care of us all
now, including Madam Beaubien."There's another anomaly: while Ames is trying to
ruin us, that girl is saving his son."I--I beg your pardon,
Elizabeth.The fact is, either you or I will have to retire from this
meeting, for I'm getting mad.I like to hear your sulphurous
language to-day.It helps to express my own feelings," replied the
woman."The circulation of the Express," Hitt went on, "is entirely
artificial.Our expense is tremendous, and our revenue slight.And
still Carmen insists on branching out and putting into practical form
her big ideas.Limitation is a word that is not in her vocabulary!""Hitt, can't we fight Ames with his own fire?"Ames is very cunning," answered Hitt."When he learned that the
cotton schedule had been altered in the Ways and Means Committee, he
promptly closed down his Avon mills.Then
he resumed, but on half time.I presume
he will later return to full time, but with a reduced scale of wages.This
way: he will force a strike at Avon--a February strike--four thousand
hands out in the cold.Meantime, he'll influence every other spinner
in the country to do likewise.Now, can
Congress stand up against that sort of argument?And, besides, he will
grease the palms of a large number of our dignified statesmen, you may
be sure!"Hitt," said Miss Wall, "I suggest that you send Carmen to Avon at
once.I know of no one who can get to the bottom of things as she can.Let her collect the facts regarding the situation down there, and
then--"

"Send her first to Washington!""Have her hang
around the lobbies of the Capitol for a while, and meet a lot of those
old sap-heads.What information she won't succeed in worming out of
them isn't in 'em, that's all!""But," objected Hitt, "if she knew that we would use her information
for a personal attack upon Ames, she'd leave us.""There's no objection to her getting the facts, anyway, is there?"demanded Haynerd, waxing hot again.I'll put a mortgage on my Ohio holdings at once.""I don't think I would be afraid," suggested Miss Wall."We might not
use the information Carmen may collect in Avon or Washington, but
something, I am sure, is bound to come out of it.Something always
comes out of what she does."All well and good," put in Haynerd."And yet, if she finds anybody
down there who needs help, even the President himself, she'll throw
the Express to the winds, just as she did in Sidney's case."No, that's true, Ned, for while we preach she's off somewhere
practicing.We evolve great truths, and she applies and demonstrates
them.But she has saved Sidney--her Christ did it through her.And she
has given the lad to us, a future valuable man.""Sure--if we are to _have_ any future," growled Ned."See here," retorted Hitt, brindling, "have we in our numerous
gatherings at Madam Beaubien's spoken truth or nonsense?If you
believe our report, then accept and apply it.Now who's to go to Avon
with Carmen?"Why, if those Magyars down there
discovered he was Ames's son, they'd eat him alive!"Then, turning to his
companions:

"Waite says he wants a meeting to-night.He'd like to report on his
research work.No
telling when we may get together again, if the girl--" He became
suddenly silent, and sat some time looking vacantly out through the
window."She goes to Avon to-morrow," he abruptly announced, "alone."His
thought had been dwelling on that'something not ourselves' which he
knew was shielding and sustaining the girl.CHAPTER 10


"We have now arrived at a subject whose interest and significance for
us are incalculable," said Father Waite, standing before the little
group which had assembled in their usual meeting place in the first
hours of the morning, for only at that time could Hitt and Haynerd
leave the Express."We have met to discuss briefly the meaning of that
marvelous record of a whole nation's search for God, the Bible.As
have been men's changing concepts of that'something not ourselves
that makes for righteousness,' so have been individuals, tribes, and
nations.The Bible records the development of these concepts in
Israel's thought; it records the unquenchable longings of that people
for truth; it records their prophetic vision, their sacred songs,
their philosophy, their dreams, and their aspirations.To most of us
the Bible has long been a work of profound mystery, cryptical,
undecipherable.And largely, I now believe, because we were wont to
approach it with the bias of preconceived theories of literal, even
verbal, inspiration, and because we could not read into it the record
of Israel's changing idea of God, from a wrathful, consuming Lord of
human caprice and passions, to the infinite Father of love, whom Jesus
revealed as the Christ-principle, which worked through him and through
all who are gaining the true spiritual concept, as is this girl who
sits here on my right with the lad whom you have seen rescued by the
Christ from the pit of hell."His voice choked when he referred to Carmen and Sidney.But he quickly
stifled his emotion, and went on:

"In our last meeting Mr.Hitt clearly showed us how the so-called
human mind has seemed to develop as the suppositional opposite of the
mind that is God; and how through countless ages of human reckoning
that pseudo-mind has been revealing its various types, until at
length, rising ever higher in the scale of being, it revealed its
human man as a mentality whose consciousness is the suppositional
activity of false thought, and which builds, incessantly, mental
concepts out of this kind of thought and posits them within itself as
material objects, as its own body, its universe, its all.And he
showed us how, little by little, that human mind's interpretations of
the infinite mind's true ideas became better, under the divine
infiltration of truth, until at last there developed a type, now known
to us as the Jewish nation, which caught a clearer glimpse of truth,
and became conscious of that'something not ourselves' which makes
for right-thinking, and consequent correct mental concepts and
externalizations.This, then, was the starting point of our religion.These first glimpses of truth, and their interpretations, as set forth
in the writings of the early Jewish nation, constitute the nucleus of
our Bible."But were these records exact statements of truth?The
primitive human mind could only lisp its wonderful glimpses of truth
in legend and myth.And so in fable and allegory the early Israelites
sought to show the power of good over evil, and thereby stimulate a
desire for right conduct, based, of course, on right-thinking.And
thus it is that the most significant thing in their sacred records is
their many, many stories of the triumph of the spiritual over the
material.Their right-thinking
became externalized outwardly in material abundance and physical
comfort.But the people's understanding was not sufficiently great to
shield them from the temptation which material wealth and power always
constitute.The mist of
materialism spread over it.Those wonderful flashes of truth ceased to
dart across their mental horizon.Their god became a magnified concept
of the human man, who dickered with them over the construction of his
temples, and who, by covenants, bribes, and promises, induced them to
behave themselves.And at length the beautiful vision
faded quite away."Then followed four hundred human years, during which the vicissitudes
of the Hebrew nation were many and dark.But during those long
centuries there developed that world wonder, a whole nation's united
longing for a deliverer!The prophets promised a great change in their
fallen fortunes.Though
their concept of Him had grossly degenerated, yet the deliverer would
come, he _must_!In the depths of their night--in the midst of the
heaviest darkness that ever lay over the world--there arose a great
light.Through the densest ignorance of the human mind filtered the
Christ-principle, and was set forth by the channel through which it
came, the man Jesus.Had there been a conference among God, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, to debate the sending of salvation to mankind, as
recorded by the poet Milton?what a crude, materialistic
conception.Had God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son?But God _is_ Love, infinite, unchanging.And His unique Son, the
Christ-principle, available to all mankind, was 'before Abraham.'Had
a great, dimly perceived principle been demonstrated, namely, that,
if we yearn long and earnestly for the right, it comes?Had the Jewish
nation 'demonstrated' the Christ?Had their centuries of looking and
expecting resulted in a saviour being manifested to them?It was a
period in the unfolding of human thought when civilization had reached
its lowest depths.Morality had evaporated to the dregs.Rome was
become the world's harlot.A few years more, and Nero would drag his
vulpine immorality across the stage.Paganism was virtue in comparison
with the lust of men in that dark hour.And yet, in the very midst of
it, appeared the most venerated, the most beloved man in all history,
bearing the Christ-message like a flaming torch!"'Always our being is descending into us,' said Emerson.But our true
being can be none other than infinite mind's idea of itself.Our true
individuality must be the way that mind regards us.And thus it was
that Israel's true being descended, filtering in through the thick
mists of error.That true being was the deliverer, _par excellence_,
for it was the message of truth that bade men deny themselves, their
carnal selves, and know but the one God, infinite mind.That was the
grace sufficient for them, that would have solved their problems, that
would have enabled them to lay off the 'old man' and his woes and
afflictions, and put on the 'new man,' divine mind's image.But the
carnal mind sought a material kingdom.It wanted, not spirit, but
matter.It cruelly rejected the message-bearer, and sought to kill his
message by slaying him on the cross.And thereby the Jewish nation
rent itself asunder, and sank into carnal oblivion.Ah, how they have
been cursed by the crucifixion of Jesus!"Men ask to-day: Did Jesus really live?Or is he a mythical character,
like the gods of pagan Rome?Let us ask, in making our reply, how
truth comes to mankind?Then the great sayings attributed to Jesus at least came from a human
being.Let us go further: it is the common history of mankind that
truth comes to the human mind only after a period of preparation.Not
conscious preparation, necessarily, but, rather, a preparation forced
by events.The truth of a mathematical principle can not come to me
unless I am prepared to receive it.And the greatest good comes to men
only after they have learned the nothingness of the material ambitions
and aims which they have been pursuing.By its own rottenness the
world had been made fallow for truth.The awfulness of its own
exposure in its rampant, unlicensed revels, had shown as never before
the human mind's absolute nothingness--its nothingness as regards real
value, permanence, and genuine good--in that first century of our
so-called Christian era.And when the nothingness of the carnal mind
was made plain, men saw the reality of the truth, as revealed in the
Christ, back of it all.The divine message was whispered to a human
mentality.And that mentality expanded under the God-influence, until
at last it gave to the sin-weary world the Christ-principle of
salvation.Let us call that human mentality, for convenience, the man
Jesus."And now, was he born of a virgin?It
was common enough in his day for virgins to pretend to be with child
by the Holy Ghost; and so we do not criticise those who refuse to
accept the dogma of the virgin birth.But a little reflection in the
light of what we have been discussing throws a wonderful illumination
upon the question.If matter and material modes are real, then we must
at once relegate the stories of the virgin birth, the miracles, the
resurrection, and the ascension to the realm of myth.If the so-called
laws of matter are real, irrefragable laws, then we indulgently, pass
by these stories as figments of heated imaginations.But, regarding
matter as a human, mortal concept, entirely mental, and wholly subject
to the impress and influence of mind, and knowing, as we do now, that
_mental concepts change with changed thought_, we are forced to look
with more favor upon these questions which for centuries caused men to
shed their fellows' blood.Hitt pointed out in our last meeting that mortal beings are
interpretations in mortal or human mind of the infinite mind, God, and
its ideas.The most perfect human interpretation of God's greatest
idea, Man, was Christ Jesus.The _real_ selfhood of every one of us is
God's idea of us.The world calls it the
'soul,' the 'divine essence,' and the 'immortal spark.'The Christ was
the real, spiritual selfhood of the man Jesus.So the Christ is the
real selfhood of each of us.It is not
conceived and brought forth in conformity with human modes.Now was
this great fact externalized in the immaculate conception and birth?It does not grow and decay and pass away in death.It is the 'unique'
Son of God which is back of each one of us.But the world has seen it
only once in its fullness, and then through the man Jesus."Something happened in that first century of the so-called Christian
era--something of tremendous significance.It was the
birth of the Christ-idea into the human consciousness.Was the
Christ-idea virgin-born?Aye, that it was, for God, infinite Mind,
alone was its origin and parent.The speculation which has turned
about that wonderful first century event has dealt with the human
channel through which the Christ-idea flowed to mankind.But let us
see what light our deductions throw even upon that."Referring all things to the realm of the mental, where we now
know they belong, we see that man never fell, but that Israel's idea
of God and man did fall, woefully.We see that the Christ-principle
appeared among men; we see that to-day it works marvels; we must
admit that throughout the ages before Jesus it had done so; we
know now that the great things which Israel is recorded to have
done were accomplished by the Christ-principle working through
men, and that when their vision became obscured they lost the
knowledge of that principle and how to use it.History records the
working of great deeds by that same Christ-principle when it was
re-born in our first century; and we also can see how the obscuring
of the spiritual by the material in the Emperor Constantine's time
caused the loss of the Church's power to do great works.We are
forced to admit the omnipotence, immanence, and eternality of the
Christ-principle, for it is divine mind, God himself.Moses, Elisha,
Elijah, the ancient prophets, all had primitive perceptions of truth,
and all became channels for the passing of the Christ-principle to
mankind in some degree.But none of these men ever illustrated that
principle as did the man Jesus.He is the most marvelous manifestation
of God that has ever appeared among mankind; so true and exact was
the manifestation that he could tell the world that in seeing him
they were actually seeing the Father.It is quite true that many
of his great sayings were not original with him.Great truths have
been voiced, even by so-called pagans, from earliest times.But he
demonstrated and made practical the truth in these sayings.And he
exposed the nothingness of the human mental concept of matter by
healing disease, walking the waves, and in other wonderful ways.It
is true that long before his time Greek philosophers had hit upon the
theory of the nothingness of matter.Plato had said that only ideas
were real.But Jesus--or the one who brought the Christ-message--was
the clearest mentality, the cleanest human window-pane, to quote
Carmen, that ever existed.Through him the divine mind showed with
almost unobscured fullness.God's existence had been discerned and
His goodness proved from time to time by prophets and patriarchs, but
by no means to the extent that Jesus proved it.There were those
before him who had asserted that there was but one reality, and that
human consciousness was not the real self.There were even those who
believed matter to be created by the force of thought, even as in
our own day._But it remained for Jesus to make those ideas
intensely practical, even to the overcoming and dissolution of his
whole material concept of the universe and man._ And it remained
for him to show that the origin of evil is in the lie about God.It
was his mission to show that the devil was 'a man-killer from the
beginning,' because it is the supposition that there is power apart
from God.It was his life purpose to show mankind that there is
nothing in this lie to cause fear, and that it can be overcome by
overcoming the false thought which produces it.By overcoming that
thought he showed men the evanescent nature of sickness and death.And sin he showed to be a missing of the mark through lack of
understanding of what constitutes real good."Turn now again to the Bible, that fascinating record of a whole
people's search for God and their changing concept of Him.Note that,
wherever in its records evil seems to be made real, it is for the
purpose of uncovering and destroying it by the vigorous statements of
truth which you will almost invariably find standing near the
exposition of error.So evil seemed very real in the first century of
our era; but it was uncovered by the coming of Jesus.The exposure of
evil revealed the Christ, right at hand.""But," protested Haynerd, "let's get back to the question of the
virgin birth.""But let us first consider what
human birth is.""Now you are touching my lifelong
question.If I am immortal, where was I before I was born?""Of which 'I' are you speaking, Ned?""The real
'I' is God's image and likeness, His reflection.It was never born,
and never dies.And therefore it will
cease to be.The human mind makes its own laws, and calls them laws of
nature, or even God's laws.Because
God is both Father and Mother to His children, His ideas, the human
mind has decreed in its counterfeiting process that it is itself both
male and female, and that the union of these two is necessary in order
to give rise to another human mind.Do you see how it imitates the
divine in an apish sort of way?And so elements of each sex-type of
the human mind are employed in the formation of another, their
offspring.The process is wholly mental, and is one of human belief,
quite apart from the usage of the divine Mind, who'spake and it was
done,' mentally unfolding a spiritual creation.The real 'you,' Ned,
has always existed as God's idea of Himself.It will come to light as the material 'you' is put off.The
material 'you' did not exist before it was humanly born.It was
produced in supposition by the union of the parent human minds, which
themselves were reflections of the male and female characteristics of
the communal mortal mind.It thus had a definite, supposititious
beginning."And so I'm doomed to annihilation, eh?"Your mortal sense of existence, Ned, certainly is doomed to
extinction.Oh, it doubtless
will not all be destroyed when you pass through that change which we
call death.It may linger until you have passed through many such
experiences.And so it behooves you to set about getting rid of it
as soon as possible, and thus avoid the unpleasant experience of
countless death-throes.You see, Ned, an error in the premise will
appear in the conclusion.Now you are starting with the premise that
the human 'you' is real.All that you reflect of divine mind will
endure permanently, but whatever you reflect of the lie regarding
that mind will pass away.Human beings know nothing of their origin,
nor of their existence._Because there is nothing to know
about them; they are entirely supposititious!_ Paul says, in his
letter to the Romans: 'They which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God.'The birth of the children of the
flesh is wholly a human-mind process.The infant mentality thus
produced knows nothing whatsoever of itself.It has no knowledge; is
not founded on truth.It will later manifest hereditary beliefs,
showing the results of prenatal mesmerism.Then it will receive the
general assortment of human thought and opinion--very little of it
based on actual truth--which the world calls education.Then it
learns to regard itself as an individual, a separate being.And soon
it attributes its origin to God.But the prenatal error will appear
in the result.The being manifests every gradation of human thought;
it grows; it suffers and enjoys materially; it bases its very
existence upon matter; it manifests the false activity of human
thought in material consciousness; and then it externalizes its
beliefs, the consentaneous human beliefs, upon its body and in its
environment; and finally, the activity of the false thought which
constitutes its consciousness ceases--and the being dies.Yes, its
death will be due to sin, to '_hamartio_,' missing the mark.And that, Ned, is human life, so-called."Death is not in any sense a cessation of life.The being who dies
never knew what it was to live.Death is the externalization of
human, mortal beliefs, which are not based upon real knowledge, truth.Paul said: 'They that are after
the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the
spirit the things of the spirit.'In other words, mankind are striving
terribly, desperately, to keep alive a sense of material, fleshly
existence.They are foredoomed to failure,
despite the discovery of antitoxins.In the book of Job we read: 'The
spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given
me life.'Where, then, is the reality in prenatal mesmerism and the
drag of heredity?It is all supposition, all a part of the one lie,
the'man-killer.'"The change called death comes to all mortals.It is the culmination
of the human mind's sense of limitation.It does not usher them into
immortal, illimitable bliss.It but leaves them upon another seeming
plane of mortal thought, there to drag out another sense of existence,
unless they have so learned the lesson which Jesus taught as to enable
them to overcome death.Why, then, do we waste our time
in trivial things; in the heaping up of useless money; in the vain
strife for sensual pleasures?The mortal will live and die, and live
and die, until at last he is beaten into line and forced to
demonstrate the Christ-principle.Hadn't we better begin that right
here and now?Wishing to die doesn't solve our problems.Suicide only
makes us start again, worse off than before.We shall overcome death
when we have overcome sin, for the physical manifestation called death
is but the externalization in conscious experience of spiritual
death--lack of a demonstrable understanding of Life, Truth, Spirit,
which is God, unlimited good.""And the Church, Protestant and Catholic, with their ceremonies, their
Masses, and--"

"They have woefully missed the mark, Ned.But I see protest rising in our good friends, Doctor Siler and
Reverend Moore, so I will hasten on, for we have much ground still to
cover."Now, knowing that birth is a humanly mental process, is it possible
that the man Jesus was 'born of a virgin'?Quite so; but, more, _no
man ever conceived and born in the way human beings are generated has
ever begun to approach Jesus in degree of spirituality_.If he had
been born in human ways, is it likely that he would ever have
developed such intense spirituality?Well, not in a brief thirty-three
years or so!And, on the other hand, if he had come into the world in
some way other than by being born of a woman, would he have been
understandable at all to the human mind?He would have
been wholly in the realm of the mental, far above human perception.If
he had been conceived by the union of the two sexes, as is the
mortal-mind mode of generation, would he not have been too material to
have so quickly developed that spirituality which made him the light
of the world at the age of thirty-three?The theory of the virgin birth at least seems to meet the
need of a sort of middle course, whereby the man should not be too
human to be the channel for the great measure of spirituality with
which he was endowed, and yet should be human enough to be appreciable
to other human minds."Remember, the Jesus who has been reported to us must have regarded
matter as unreal, as nothingness.And
they as plainly show that he came from the Father.His whole life was
such as to render the virgin birth almost a necessity, as I see it.And from a study of the Gospels I
simply can not avoid the conclusion that his knowledge of the allness
of God rendered matter such a nonentity to him that he overcame all
material laws, overcame the world of matter, and even at the last
dematerialized his material body.It's an astonishing thought--and
yet, who can show that it is not true?There are some things that
reason insists on our accepting, despite the paucity of human
records."Waite," said Doctor Morton, "that the Gospels
according to Mark and John make no mention of the virgin birth."And I will go further: Biblical
research during the past few years seems to have established the
conclusion that Mark's Gospel antedates the others, but that prior to
it there existed a collection of sayings by Jesus, called the _Logia_.This collection of sayings seems to have been originally written in
Aramaic, the language Jesus spoke.Now Matthew Arnold tells us that
the Gospel narratives passed through at least fifty years of oral
tradition before they became fixed in the form in which we now have
them.Of course it is quite possible that the story of the virgin
birth arose during those fifty years, for we can imagine how the life
of Jesus was then discussed!Matthew and Luke alone speak of the
virgin birth.Mark's Gospel we believe to have been written by Mark
himself.And we believe that Papias, who wrote about the middle of the
second century, spoke truly when he said: 'Mark having become (or
having been) Peter's interpreter, wrote all that he remembered (or all
that Peter related) though he did not (record) in order that which
was said or done by Christ.'In other words, even as Renan admits,
the Gospel of Mark must be taken as authentically his.Now Matthew's
Gospel depends for most of its data upon Mark and the Collection of
sayings.Mark's Gospel does not mention the virgin birth; the
Collection probably did.Also, Matthew probably did not write the
Gospel attributed to him; but he almost certainly did write the
Collection of sayings, from which in part the present Gospel according
to Matthew was compiled.Luke's Gospel was undoubtedly written by the
physician Luke, Paul's companion, and depended largely for its data
upon Mark's Gospel and the Collection of Matthew.Yet we can not say
that the omission of mention in the Gospels according to Mark and John
of the virgin birth renders the story a legend, in view of our own
present great knowledge of the constitution of matter, of material
laws, and of the fact that the virgin birth is at least rendered
credible by the subsequent very extraordinary career of Jesus.Moreover, remember that our New Testament is a small book, and that it
is quite probable that a great mass of literature existed on the
subject of Jesus and his work, and that it is possible that other of
the disciples wrote treatises, perhaps many of them.How many of these
touched on the subject of the virgin birth we may never know.But this conclusion at least we must accept: the
validity of the story of the virgin birth does _not_ rest with the
four Gospels which have come down to us out of the great mass of
literature which probably once existed.Rather is the probability of
the immaculate conception a function of our present knowledge of
matter, its pseudo-laws, and the great fact that the entire life of
Jesus as reported in all the Gospels lends weight to the belief that
his birth was not in the ordinary mortal-mind manner.""And I," said Carmen, "can not see that the origin of the human
channel through which the Christ-principle flowed to mankind is of any
consequence.Jesus said that it
existed before Abraham."It has been said that the
immaculate conception was the result of Mary's realization that real
man is the son of God.Certainly Jesus
did seem to manifest some such metaphysical idea.Perhaps Mary was a
woman of tremendous force of character.Perhaps it did come to her
that her son should be the Messiah of his race.Jesus certainly did
acquire the messianic consciousness--and thereby upheaved the world.But, whatever the human mode of birth, certainly the Christ-principle
was brought into the world because of the world's tremendous need.It is only the confusing of the Christ with the
man Jesus that is so largely responsible for the weakness of orthodox
theology."But now, referring again to the Bible, let me say that the Pentateuch
is composed of a variety of documents written by various authors.We
have no positive proof that Moses had aught to do with its authorship,
although parts of it may be based on data which either he originated
or sanctioned.The books of Samuel exhibit a plurality of sources.The
book of Isaiah was written to record the sayings of at least two
persons, both men of marvelous spiritual vision.The Song of Solomon
was originally probably a Persian love-poem.The book of Job
illustrates the human-mind problem of suffering, and the utter
inadequacy of philosophy to heal it.It is a ringing protest against
conventional theology."But it is with the New Testament that we are particularly concerned,
for we believe it to contain the method of salvation from human ills.None of the original documents are extant, of course.And yet, the
most searching textual criticism goes to show that the New Testament
books as we have them to-day are genuine reproductions of the original
documents, with but very little adulteration of erroneous addition by
later hands.I have already spoken of the first
three Gospels.The book of Acts certainly was written by the author of
the third Gospel, Luke.First Peter was composed by the disciple
Peter, or was written under his sanction.The Gospel of John and the
book of First John were written by one and the same author--but
whether by the disciple John or not, I can not say.If this great
disciple did not write the Fourth Gospel, at least his influence seems
to be felt all through it.The probability is that he knew what was in
it, and approved of it, although the actual composition may have been
by another, possibly a very learned Greek.To me, the Fourth Gospel is
the most masterly work ever composed by man.The criticism that John, being a Jew, could not have composed
it, falls before the greater truth that, having become a Christian, he
was no longer a Jew.For how could he have been
other, seeing that he had lived with Jesus?"And now as to Paul, who contributes about one-third of the New
Testament.I have mentioned the letters to the Thessalonians,
Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans as indisputably his.To these we
can add, with scarcely less weight of authenticity, Colossians,
Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians.As to the Epistles to Timothy
and Titus, there is still doubt.These letters were written to the
various Churches chronologically, as I have mentioned them.It has
been said that Jesus was way over the heads of his reporters.But--and
here is the important fact for us--Paul's letters exhibit a
marvelous spiritual growth in the man, and show him at last to be the
grand master-metaphysician of the Christian era.Has it ever
occurred to you that what the Gospels tell about is almost wholly
spiritual?The material is all but neglected by their composers.Indeed, with the questions of time and place, the Gospel narrators
seemed to have been but slightly concerned.But with the delineation
of the Christ--ah!In the light of
this great truth the apparent lack of harmony in the Gospel
narratives loses significance.And how little there is in the
Gospels of theology, of institution, of organization!How trifling are
creed and doctrine, how little are Catholicism and Protestantism,
compared with the stupendous fact that God is, and that His truth,
the Christ-principle, is still here to-day and available!"And so with Paul, he was expounding the'method and secret' of the
Christ.And he first had to work up to it himself.He may have
thought, when he wrote his first letter to the Thessalonians, that the
man Jesus would come again in the skies, with great pomp and
surrounded by the Saints.But in his second letter he states plainly
that the Christ will come when the 'old man' is laid off.Not much
occasion for misunderstanding there, I think.Indeed, after Jesus so
clearly stated that the kingdom of heaven was within men, the marvel
is that there could have arisen any confusion whatsoever on the
subject of the second coming of the Christ.""I believe," interposed Reverend Moore, "that the Epistle to the
Hebrews contains statements of belief in a judgment after death, in a
heaven, a hell, and everlasting life, not wholly consistent with your
remarks.""The Epistle to the Hebrews," returned Father Waite, "was not written
by Paul, nor is it quite consistent with his letters.But, read Paul's
wonderful eighth chapter of Romans.Read his third chapter of First
Corinthians.Read all his letters in the order in which I have
mentioned them, which was as they were written, and you can not fail
to grasp his marvelous expanding perception of the Christ-principle;
the nothingness of the material concept; the impotence of the lie that
opposes God, and constitutes all evil; and the necessity of
right-thinking if one would work out his salvation from the errors
that assail mankind.Paul shows that he passed through a 'belief
period,' and that he emerged into the light of demonstrable
understanding at last.If men had followed him they never could have
fallen into the absurd theological beliefs of foreordination, infant
damnation, the resurrection of the flesh, and all the other
theological horrors and atrocities of the centuries."Yes, the Bible is, as Arnold said, based on propositions which all
can verify.The trouble is, _mankind have not tried to verify them_!They have relegated all that to the life beyond the grave.I fear a
sorry disappointment awaits them, for, even as Paul says, they will be
after the change called death only what they were before.It is like
recovering from a case of sickness, for sickness and death are alike
manifestations of mortal thought.We awake from each still human,
still with our problems before us.We must break the mesmerism of the
belief that the practical application of Jesus' teachings must be
relegated to the realm of death, or to the unattainable.We must apply
the Christ-principle, and learn to hit the mark, for sin is always
weakness, never strength."And remember this: having acquired a knowledge of the Christ, we are
bidden to acknowledge him--that is, to _act-our-knowledge_.Many of
the world's philosophers have worked out great truths.But they have
rested content with that.Many scientists, knowing that matter is
unreal, nevertheless conduct themselves _as if it constituted the one
and only real fact of existence_!Then its
opposite _can not_ be real.The human mentality holds the belief that
there is something apart from God, spirit.That belief becomes
objectified in the human mentality as matter.And within matter is
contained all evil of every sort and name.Evil is not, as the
philosophers would have us believe, a lower form of good.It is not
'good in the making.'It is always error, the direct opposite of
truth.And if truth is real and eternal, error can not be.See the
grave mistake in which Emerson became enmeshed.He said: 'There seems
to be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms.'Now
follow that out to its logical conclusion.If spirit is synonymous
with God, then God manifests Himself in both good and evil, fair and
foul, life and death--and which is good, and which bad?No, my friends, rather accept Jesus' statement
that evil is the lie, of which no man need be afraid, and which all
must and shall overcome.And the 'old man,' with all his material
concepts of nature and the universe, must and will be laid off, thus
revealing the spiritual man, the image and likeness of the one divine
Mind."Now, just a few words about miracles, the great stumbling block to
the acceptance of the Gospels.Are they, together with the entire
Gospel narrative, legendary?If so, they must have arisen during
those fifty years between Jesus and the recording of the narratives.But this very period is covered by Paul's letters, which record his
thought.And even the most relentless of Bible critics admit the
genuineness of Paul's authorship of the Epistles to the Romans,
the Corinthians, the Thessalonians, and the Galatians.If the
Gospel narratives are legends, they grew up and found acceptance in
fifty years.A pretty fair miracle in itself, when we take into
consideration the inherent incredulity of the human mind!As Dean
Farrar says: 'Who would have _invented_, who would have merely
_imagined_, things so unlike the thoughts of man as these?'"Now Paul must have been acquainted with men who had seen and known
Jesus.And we are forced to admit that Paul was a very strong, sane
man.These legends could not have grown up in his day and been
accepted by him.And as long as there were men living who had known
Jesus--and that must have been as late as the last quarter of the
first century--the true events of Jesus' life could hardly have given
way to a set of childish legends.As a matter of recorded fact, the
various Christian Churches had accepted Jesus within thirty years of
the crucifixion.And, too, the words of Paul and the Synoptists were
written at a time when the sick were still being healed and even the
dead raised by the practical application of Jesus' teachings.Hence,
miracles did not astonish them."Our own inability to perform the works attributed to Jesus is hardly
sufficient ground for denying the belief that he really did them.Certainly that the greater portion of the New
Testament was written by a few fishermen, a publican, and a tentmaker
is one of the most stupendous miracles on record!And the miracle of
miracles is Jesus Christ himself!Because Jesus is reported to have
healed the sick, raised the dead, and walked the waves, all in
opposition to material laws--the so-called laws of nature--the world
says the reports are fantastic, that they are fables, and that his
reporters were hypnotized, deluded!And yet I tell you that he did not
break a single law!He did act in defiance of the so-called testimony
of the physical senses, which has always been accepted by mankind as
law.We now know what that sense-testimony is--human, mortal thought.And because he did so,
he instantaneously healed the sick.A miracle expresses, not the
beliefs of the human mind, but the law of God, infinite mind, and
makes that law conceivable to the human mentality.God's laws are
_never_ set aside, for by very definition a law is immutable, else it
ceases to be law.But when the human mind grows out of itself
sufficiently to perceive those laws and to express them to its
fellow-minds, the result is called a miracle.Moreover, the ability to
perform miracles is but a function of spirituality.A miracle is a
sign of one's having advanced to such a degree of spirituality as to
enable him to rise above material consciousness and its limitations,
which are called laws.The consciousness that knows no evil will
perform miracles.These works
were the'signs following,' and attested their knowledge of the
allness of God.Carmen--"

"Lewis!"Carmen _knew_ that no power opposed to God
could hold Sidney.She broke a human-mind, so-called law, a limitation.She
proved God's law of harmony and holiness--wholeness--to be omnipresent
and omnipotent.And, mark me, friends, _every one of us must learn to
do likewise_!Not only must the Church obey Jesus and do the works
which he did, but every individual will have to do them himself.""His works were done for a special reason, Mr.Waite," interposed
Reverend Moore."They were to testify to his messiahship.Father Waite silently regarded the minister for some moments.Then he
went on gently:

"It seems incredible that the plain teachings of Jesus could have
been so warped and twisted as they have been by orthodox theology.Why should even the preachers themselves
condemn the one who seeks to obey Christ?Moore, the real man
is God's highest idea of Himself.The human mind makes mental concepts
of God's man.And Jesus was the grandest concept of God's idea of
Himself that the human mind has ever constructed by means of its
interpretations.One of his grandest
characteristics was his implicit obedience to his vision of the
Father.And he demanded just as implicit obedience from us.But he
bade us, again and again, _heal the sick and raise the dead_!"And Asa had his physicians to whom he turned--with the result
that he'slept with his fathers.'There is no more ironical statement
in the whole Bible than that.We turn to our physicians because we
have no faith in God._Materia medica_ physicians do _not_ heal the
sick.They sometimes succeed in causing the human mind temporarily to
substitute a belief of health for a belief of disease that is all.But Jesus and the early Christians healed by true prayer--the prayer
of affirmation, the prayer that denied reality to evil, and affirmed
the omnipotence of God.And that was done through an understanding of
God as immutable law, or principle."demanded Reverend Moore, with a note
of contempt in his voice."I prefer my own concept of God, as one who
hears our petitions, and pities us, and not as a lifeless principle!"Moore," replied Father Waite, "in that He is
'_that by which all is_.'And in order to be such He must be, as the
Bible says, 'the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.'He must be
immovable, regardless of human pleading and petition.And so true
prayer, the prayer that draws an answer, is not an objective appeal to
Him, but is an intelligent application of the Christ-principle to all
our problems and needs.Such prayer will remove mountains in
proportion to the understanding and motive back of it.And such prayer
does not seek to inform the Almighty of the state of affairs here
among men, informing Him that evil is real and rampant, and begging
that He will stoop down and remove it.It is the prayer that manifests
man's oneness with the infinite mind as its image, reflecting a
knowledge of the allness of good and the consequent unreality and
powerlessness of evil, the lie about it.It was healing by such
prayer, Mr.Moore, that the Episcopal Synod rejected only recently.Instead of doing the healing themselves by means of the principle
given them, they still plead with God, the immovable and immutable, to
do it for them, provided the very uncertain science of _materia
medica_ fails."The true method of prayer was employed by the early Christians, until
the splendid vision of the Christ became obscured and finally lost to
the Church by its bargaining with Constantine for a mess of pottage,
namely, temporal power.Then began to rise that great worldly
institution, the so-called Holy Church.In the first half of the sixth
century Justinian closed the schools of philosophy at Athens.For a
while Judaizing Christianity continued its conflict with Gnosticism.And then both merged themselves into the Catholic form of faith, which
issued forth from Rome, with Christian tradition grafted upon
paganism.Theology and ritualism divided the gospel of healing the
sick and saving the sinner into two radically different systems,
neither of which is Christian, and neither of which can either heal or
save.Since then, lip-service and ceremonial have taken the place of
healing the sick and raising the dead.The world again slipped back
steadily from the spiritual to the material, and to-day ethics
constitutes our religion, and stupid drugs hold sway where once sat
enthroned the healing Christ-principle."Waite, that I have Catholic leanings myself,"
said Doctor Siler."I don't like to hear either my religion or my
profession abused.""My criticism, Doctor," replied Father Waite, "is but an exposure of
the entrenched beliefs and modes of the human mind.""But, sir, the Church is a great social force, and a present
necessity.""The worth of a belief as a social force, Doctor, must be ascertained
from its fruits.The Roman Church has been an age-long instigator of
wars, disorders, and atrocious persecutions throughout the world.Its
assumption that its creed is the only religious truth is an insult to
the world's expanding intelligence.Its arrogant claim to speak with
the authority of God is one of the anomalies of this century of
enlightenment.Its mesmeric influence upon the poor and ignorant is a
continuous tragedy."Are you unmindful of the Church's schools and
hospitals?"Nor am I ignorant of the fact that the success of
Christianity is _not_ measured by hospitals.Rather, their continuance
attests the lamentable failure of its orthodox misinterpretation.I do not want to see this splendid country
forced into the iron shackles of priestcraft."cried Haynerd, pounding the table with his
fist."The time has passed when a man can say, 'My church, be she
right or wrong, but my church!'and insist that it shall be forced
upon us, whether we like it or not!""Doctor," continued Father Waite, "the Romanist has always missed the
mark.He prayed to a God of love to give him power to exterminate
heretics--those who differed with him in belief.But he prayed with
iniquity, hatred, murder in his heart; and God, who is too pure to
know evil, heard him not.Prayer is the affirmation of omnipotent
_good_.Is it good to murder one's fellow-men?The Psalmist wrote: 'If
I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.'That is why
the Church's prayers and curses have failed, and why she herself is a
failing institution to-day.I say this in pity, not in malice.""I, sir, believe in a religion that can hate," returned the doctor."Christianity is as much a religion of hate as of love--hatred of all
that is evil and opposed to the revealed Word of God.""And thereby your religion will fail, and has failed, for God is love.You, by your hatred of what you consider evil, make evil real.Indeed,
the Church has always emphasized evil as a great and living reality.How could it ever hope to overcome it then?Your Church, Doctor, has
little of the meekness of the Christ, and so, little of his strength.Its numbers and great material
wealth do not constitute power.Its assumptions remind me of the
ancient Jews, who declared that God spent much of His time reading
their Talmud.You will have to lay aside, Doctor, all of it, and turn
to the simple, demonstrable teachings of Jesus.When you have learned
to do the works he did, then will you have justified yourself and your
faith."While Father Waite was speaking, Carmen had quietly risen and taken
her place at the piano.When he concluded, she began to play and sing
softly.As the sweet melody flowed out through the room the little
group became silent and thoughtful.Again it was that same weird
lament which the girl had sung long before in the Elwin school to
voice the emotions which surged up in her during her loneliness in the
great city.In it her auditors heard again that night the echoing
sighs of the passive Indians, enslaved by the Christian Spaniards.Hitt's head sank upon his breast as he listened.Haynerd tried to
speak, but choked.The Beaubien buried her face in her hands and wept
softly.The lines about Doctor Siler's mouth relaxed, and his lips
trembled.He rose quietly and went around to where Father Waite sat."My friend--" He bent and took Father Waite's hand.Father Waite sprang to his feet and threw an arm about the doctor."We
are more than that, Doctor," he whispered.And in
reality we are both, here and now, beloved children of God."Then he nodded to the others, and took his
departure.As he passed the piano Carmen rose and seized his hand."You know, Doctor, that we love you, don't you?""Your love," he murmured, as he bent over her hand, "is from the
Christ.Nay, it _is_ the Christ himself among us!"He would have said more, but his voice broke.When Hitt, Reverend Moore, and Doctor Morton had left, Haynerd, who
had remained for a moment to speak to Father Waite, turned to the
Beaubien."Madam," he said, "Mr.But--" He stopped and looked at Carmen."Well,
if I mistake not, his quietness this evening indicated his belief that
this might be our last meeting for some time."Then, abruptly:

"Telephone me, Carmen, if anything of interest comes up to-morrow in
Avon."The Beaubien turned quickly to the girl."You are going to Avon
to-morrow?There was a look of fear in her
eyes.Carmen drew the woman to her, then stooped and kissed her cheek."Mother dearest, I go to Avon with my God."CHAPTER 11


The town of Avon, two hours from New York, lay along Avon creek, from
which its first manufacturing industries derived their motive power.Years before, when it was little more than a barren stretch of sand,
some enterprising soul had built a cotton mill there, with only a few
primitive looms.As the years passed, and kindly Congresses reared
about the industry a high protective wall, the business prospered
marvelously.But shortly after the death of the senior Ames the
company became involved, through mismanagement, with the result that,
to protect itself, the house of Ames and Company, the largest
creditor, was obliged to take over its mills.At first, J. Wilton Ames was disposed to sell the assets of the
defunct company, despite the loss to his bank.But then, after a visit
of inspection, and hours of meditation on certain ideas which had
occurred to him, he decided to keep the property.The banging of the
looms, the whirr of the pickers, the sharp little shrieks of the
spinning machines, fascinated him, as he stood before them.They
seemed to typify the ceaseless throbbing of his own great brain.They
seemed, too, to afford another outlet for that mighty flood of
materialistic thought and energy which flowed incessantly through it.And so he set about reorganizing the business.He
familiarized himself with every detail of the cotton market.He was
already well versed in the intricacies of the tariff.And soon the
idle machinery was roaring again.Soon the capacity of the mills was
doubled.And soon, very soon, the great Ames mills at Avon had become
a corporate part of our stupendous mechanical development of the
century just closed.When Carmen stepped from the train that morning she stood for a moment
looking uncertainly about her.Everywhere on one side as far as she
could see were low, ramshackle frame houses; a few brick store
buildings stood far up the main street; and over at her right the
enormous brick mills loomed high above the frozen stream.The dull
roar of the machinery drifted through the cold air to her ears.Up the
track, along which she had just come, some ragged, illy clad children
were picking up bits of coal.She went directly to them, and asked their names."Anton Spivak," answered one of the children dully, when she laid a
hand on his shoulder."Over dere," pointing off to the jungle of decrepit sheds."Me an'
him, we worked in de mills; but dere ain't no work fer us now."Take me to your home," she said firmly."Dere ain't nobody to home," he
replied."De ol' man an' woman works in de mills daytimes.""Come-a home wi' me," spoke up the boy's companion, a bright-faced
little urchin of some ten years who had given his name as Tony Tolesi.Carmen looked at him for a moment.Up the main street of the town they went for a short distance, then
turned and wended their course, through narrow streets and byways,
down toward the mills.In a few minutes they were in the district
where stood the great frame structures built by the Ames company to
house its hands.Block after block of these they passed, massive,
horrible, decrepit things, and at last stopped at a grease-stained,
broken door, which the little fellow pushed open.Carmen followed shivering, close after the boy, while
he trotted along, proud of the responsibility of conducting a visitor
to his home.At the far end of the hall the lad plunged into a narrow
staircase, so narrow that a stout man could not have mounted it.Up
four of these broken flights Carmen toiled after him, and then down a
long, desolate corridor, which sent a chill into the very marrow of
her bones."Dis is where we lives, Missy," announced the little fellow."Miss-a
Marcus, she live in dere," pointing to the door directly opposite.He pushed open the door before which they had halted.A rush of foul
air and odors of cooking swept out.They enveloped the girl and seemed
to hurl her back.A black-haired woman, holding a crying baby in her
arms, rose hastily from an unmade bed at one side of the room.Two
little girls, six or eight years of age, and a boy still younger,
ranged about their mother and stared in wide-eyed wonder."Dis-a lady, she come to visit," announced Carmen's guide abruptly,
pointing a dirty finger at her.The woman's face darkened, and she spoke harshly in a foreign tongue
to the little fellow."She say," the boy interpreted, as a crestfallen look spread over his
face, "she say she don't spik _Inglese_.""But I speak your language," said the girl, going quickly to her and
extending a hand.Then, in that soft tongue which is music celestial
to these Neapolitan strangers upon our inhospitable shores, she added,
"I want to know you; I want to talk to you."A littered, greasy cook stove
stood in one corner.Close to it at either end were wooden couches,
upon which were strewn a few tattered spreads and blankets, stained
and grimy.A broken table, a decrepit chest of drawers, and a few
rickety chairs completed the complement of furniture.The walls were
unadorned, except for a stained chromo of the Virgin, and the plaster
had fallen away in many places.Several of its panes were broken and stuffed with rags and papers.At the sound of her own language the woman's expression changed.A
light came into her dull eyes, and she awkwardly took the proffered
hand.Then, sweeping
the girl's warm attire with a quick glance, "You are rich!I am rich, yes, but not in money."The woman turned to her children and sent the little brood scattering.At another sharp command little Tony set out a soiled, broken chair
for Carmen.But before the girl could take it the woman's voice again
rose sharply."You are--what do
you say?You come with your gay party to look us over and go
away laughing!But reaching out, she gently lifted the heavy
baby from the woman's arms and sat down with it.For a moment she
patted its cheeks and bent tenderly over it.Then she looked up at the
bewildered mother."I have come here," she said softly, "because I love you."She turned dully and sat down
on one of the begrimed beds.Her little ones gathered about her, their
soiled fingers in their mouths, or clutching their tattered gowns, as
they gazed at the beautiful creature who had suddenly come into their
midst."I am not from the mission," replied the girl gently."I have come to
talk, not of heaven, but of earth, and of you, and of Tony," smiling
down into the eager face of the little boy as he stood before her."You can't take
any of my children!The judge took Pietro Corrello's boy last
week--but you can't have mine!"I don't want your children," said Carmen, smiling up at the
frightened, suspicious mother.I want you to help me to
help all of these people here who need us.The mills are running only
half time, aren't they?But we,
you and I, are going to make things better for them, for everybody
here, aren't we?"But first," she went on hastily, to further allay the poor woman's
fears and to check additional protest, "suppose we plan our dinner.Let's see, Tony, what would you like?"He glanced
inquiringly at his mother; but no sign came from her.Then he could no
longer contain himself:

"Spaghetti!"Carmen drew out her purse and turned to the woman."While we are gone, Tony and the children will wash the dishes
and set the table.For a moment the woman looked uncomprehendingly at the girl, then at
her children, and then about the miserable room in which they were
huddled.Amazement and confusion sat upon her heavy features.Then
these gave way to another dark look of suspicion.She opened her
mouth--

But before she could voice her resentment, Carmen rose and threw an
arm about her.Then the girl quickly drew the startled woman to her
and kissed her on the cheek."Come," she whispered, "get your shawl.God's universal language is the language of love.All nations, all
tribes understand it.The flood-gates, long barred, swiftly opened,
and the tired, miserable woman sank sobbing upon the bed.She could
not comprehend what it was that had come so unannounced into her
dreary existence that cold winter morning.People were not wont to
treat her so.Her life had been an endless, meaningless struggle
against misery, want, grinding oppression.People did not put their
arms around her and kiss her thus.They scoffed at her, they abused
her, they fought with her!She hated them, and the world in which she
lived!"I know, I know," whispered Carmen, as she drew the sobbing woman's
head upon her shoulder.She drew back, and a frightened, superstitious look came into her
face."Yes," said Carmen softly, taking the cue, "I am an angel, right from
heaven.Now you are no longer afraid of me, are you?The woman rose mechanically and took up her thin shawl.Carmen gave a
few directions to the gaping children.And as she went out into the
bleak hall with the woman she heard one of them whisper in tones of
awe:

"Tony, she said she--she was--an angel!Get down on your knees
and cross yourself!"*       *       *       *       *

Upward to the blue vault of heaven, like the streaming mists that
rise through the tropic moonlight from the hot _llanos_, goes the
ceaseless cry of humanity.Oh, if the god of the preachers were real,
his heart must have long since broken!Upward it streams, this
soul-piercing cry; up from the sodden, dull-brained toiler at the
crashing loom; up from the wretched outcast woman, selling herself
to low passions to escape the slavery of human exploitation; up from
the muttering, ill-fed wreck, whose life has been cashed into
dividends, whose dry, worthless hulk now totters to the scrap heap;
up from the white-haired, flat-chested mother, whose stunted babes
lie under little mounds with rude, wooden crosses in the dreary
textile burial grounds; up from the weak, the wicked, the ignorant,
the hopeless martyrs of the satanic social system that makes
possible the activities of such human vultures as the colossus
whose great mills now hurled their defiant roar at this girl, this
girl whose life-motif was love.Close about her, at the wretched little table, sat the wondering group
of children, greedily gorging themselves on the only full meal that
they could remember.And with them sat the still bewildered mother,
straining her dark eyes at the girl, and striving to see in her a
human being, a woman like herself.At her right sat the widow Marcus,
who lived just across the hall.Her husband had been crushed to death
in one of the pickers two years before.The company had paid her a
hundred dollars, but had kept back five for alleged legal fees.She
herself had lost an arm in one of these same pickers, long ago,
because the great owner of the mills would not equip his plant with
safety devices.said the mother at length, as a sense of the reality of
life suddenly returned to her.Tony hurriedly swept the contents of his plate into his mouth, and
went for the battered dinner pail."My man goes to work at six-thirty in the morning," she explained to
Carmen, when the little fellow had started to the mills with the pail
unwontedly full."And he does not leave until five-thirty.He was a
weaver, and he earned sometimes ten dollars a week.And so he had to take a job as carder.He earns
about eight dollars a week now."But you can't live on that, with your children!""Yes, we could," replied the woman, "if the work was steady.You see, if I could work steady, and the children too, we could
live.And I am not nearly so worn out as he is.I
have several years left in me yet."The widow Marcus, who spoke the language from an association with
Italian immigrants since childhood, added her comments from time to
time.She was a gray-haired, kindly soul, bearing no enmity toward the
man to whom she had yielded her husband's life and her own."A man's no good in the mills after he's fifty," she said."You see,
Miss, it's all piece-work, and a man has to be most terribly spry and
active.The strain is something awful, day after day, in the noise and
bad air, and having to keep your eyes fixed on your work for ten hours
at a stretch; and he wears out fast.Then he has to take a job where
he can't make so much.And when he's about fifty he's no good for the
mills any more.""Well, if he hasn't any children, he goes to the poor-house.But, if
he has, then they take care of him.""Yes, they've got to, Miss.The little ones must work in the mills,
too.These mills here take them on when they are only twelve, or even
younger.Tony has worked there, and he is only ten.It's against the
law; but Mr.The company paid me some money two years ago, and I
haven't spent all of it yet.I'm pretty
spry with one arm.""But--you do not pay rent for your home?"Ames--the man whose machines killed your
husband and took off your arm--you still pay rent to him, for one
little room?"Why, his company gave me almost a
hundred dollars, you know!I was lucky, for when Lizzie Sidel's man
lost his hand in the cog wheels he went to law to sue the company, and
three years afterward the case was thrown out of court and he had to
pay the costs himself.But he was a picker-boss, and got nine dollars
a week."A little hand stole up along Carmen's arm.She looked down into the
wondering face of the child."I--I just wanted to see, _Signorina_, if
you were real.""I have been wondering that myself, dear," replied the girl, as her
thought dwelt upon what she had been hearing."I must go now, Miss," said the widow Marcus, rising."I promised to
drop in and look after Katie Hoolan's children this afternoon."Then I will go with you," Carmen announced."But I will come back
here," she added, as some little hands seized hers."If not to-day,
then soon--perhaps to-morrow."Marcus, and entered the doorway
which led to the little inner room where dwelt the widow.There were a
dozen such rooms in the building, the latter informed her.This one in
particular had been shunned for many years, for it had a bad
reputation as a breeder of tuberculosis.But the rent was low, and so
the widow had taken it after her man was killed.It contained a broken
stove, a dirty bed, and a couple of unsteady chairs.The walls were damp, and the paper which had once covered them
was molding and rotting off."It won't stay on," the widow explained, as she saw the girl looking
at it.The
creek overflows and runs into the basement.They call this the
'death-room.'"Carmen shuddered when she looked about this fearful human
habitation.Yet, "The only death to be feared," said Paracelsus, "is
unconsciousness of God."Was this impoverished woman, then, any less
truly alive than the rich owner of the mills which had robbed her of
the means of existence?And can a civilization be alive to the Christ
when it breeds these antipodal types?"Ames's
methods are the epitome of hell!But he is ours, and the worthy
offspring of our ghastly, inhuman social system.We alone are to
blame that he debauches courts, that he blinds executives, and that he
buys legislatures!We let him make the laws, and fatten upon the
prey he takes within their limits.Aye, he is the crafty, vicious,
gold-imbruted manifestation of a whole nation's greed!"Nay, more, he
is the externalization of a people's ignorance of God.Carmen's throat filled as she watched the old woman bustling about the
wretched room and making a feeble attempt at order."You see," the widow went on, happy in the possession of an auditor,
"there is no use making apologies for the looks of my room; I couldn't
make it look much better if I tried.We have
to get water from the hydrant down back of the house.It is pumped
there from the creek, and it's a long climb up these stairs when
you've got only one arm to hold the bucket.And I have to bring my
coal up, too.The coal dealer charges extra for bringing it up so
far."Carmen sat down on an empty box and watched her.The woman's lot
seemed to have touched the depths of human wretchedness, and yet there
burned within her soul a something that the oppression of human
avarice could not extinguish."It's the children, Miss, that I think about," she continued."It's
not so bad as when I was a little one and worked in the cloth mills in
England.I was only six when I went into the mills there.I worked
from seven in the morning until after six at night.And the air was so
bad and we got so tired that we children used to fall asleep, and the
boss used to carry a stick to whip us to keep us awake.My parents
died when I was only eight.They worked in the Hollow-ware works, and
died of lead poisoning.People only last four or five years at that
work.""How many children are employed in these mills here?""I want to see them," said the girl, and there was a hitch in her
voice as she spoke."You can go down and watch them come out about six this evening.But now I must hurry to look after the Hoolan
babes."When she again reached the street Carmen turned and looked up at the
hideous structure from which she had emerged; then she drew a long
breath.The foul air of the "death-room" seemed to fill her lungs as
with leaden weights.The dim light that lay over the wretched hovel
hung like a veil before her eyes."Katie lives a block down the street," said the widow, pointing in the
direction.These tenements don't have
fire-escapes, and the one she lived in burned to the ground in an
hour.She lived on the second floor, and got out.It seemed to Carmen as she listened to the woman that the carnal
mind's chamber of horrors was externalized there in the little town of
Avon, existing with the dull consent of a people too ignorant, too
imbruted, too mesmerized by the false values of life to rise and
destroy it.All that cold winter afternoon the girl went from door to door.There
was no thought of fear when she met dull welcomes, scowls, and
menacing glances.In humble homes and wretched hovels; to Magyar,
Pole, Italian alike; to French Canadian, Irish and Portuguese; and to
the angry, the defiant, the sodden, the crushed, she unfolded her
simple banner of love, the boundless love that discriminates not, the
love that sees not things, but the thoughts and intents of the heart
that lie behind them.And dark looks faded, and tears came; withered
hearts opened, and lifeless souls stirred anew.She knew their
languages; and that knowledge unlocked their mental portals to her.She knew their thoughts, and the blight under which they molded; and
that knowledge fell like the sun's bright rays upon them.She knew
God, their God and hers; and that knowledge began, even on that dull,
gray afternoon, to cut into the chains of human rapacity which
enslaved them.At six that evening she stood at the tall iron gate of the mill yard.Little Tony was at her side, clutching her hand.A single electric
lamp across the street threw a flickering, yellow light upon the snow.The great, roaring mills were ablaze with thousands of glittering
eyes.Suddenly their monster sirens shrieked, a blood-curdling yell.Then their huge mouths opened, and a human flood belched forth.They were not the image and likeness
of God, these creatures, despite the doctrinal platitudes of the
Reverend Darius Borwell and the placid Doctor Jurges.They were not
alive, these stooping, shuffling things, despite the fact that the
religiously contented Patterson Moore would argue that God had
breathed the spirit of life into the thing of dust which He created.And these children, drifting past in a great, surging throng!Fathers
and mothers of a generation to come!Carmen knew that many of them,
despite their worn looks, were scarcely more than ten years old.These
were the flesh and blood upon which Ames, the jungle-beast, waxed
gross!Upon their thin life-currents floated the magnificent
_Cossack_!Yes, she was right, evil can _not_ be
really known.There is no principle by which to explain the hideous
things of the human mind.And then she wondered what the Reverend
Darius Borwell did to earn that comfortable salary of ten thousand a
year in his rich New York church."It's quite a sight, ain't it, Miss?"He was a man of medium height,
young, and of Irish descent."It's a great sight," he continued, with a touch of brogue in his
tones.he cried, catching a passing workman's arm."He ain't worked to-day, Father," replied the man, stopping and
touching his cap.The young priest uttered an exclamation of displeasure.Then, as the
workman started away:

"You'll be at the Hall to-night, Fagin?The man addressed nodded and gave an affirmative grunt, then passed on
into the darkness."It's trying to reach a few of 'em I am," remarked the priest.When a man's stomach's empty he hasn't much respect
for morality.And I can't feed the lot of 'em!"Carmen gazed into the kindly blue eyes of the priest and wondered."No--but I am interested in my fellow-beings."I've some rooms, some on Main street,
which I call the Hall, and some down in the--well, the bad district,
which I call the Mission.They're reading rooms, places for men to meet,
and get acquainted, and rest, and talk.The Hall's for the fellows
who work, like this Fagin.The Mission's for the down-and-outs.""But--are your rooms only for--for men of your faith?""Race or
religion don't figure.It's to give help to every man that needs it.""And you are giving your life to help these people?""I want to see your Hall and Mission.Take me to them," she abruptly
demanded.He looked down at little Tony,
and then up at Carmen again."We will leave the boy at his door, and then go to
your Mission and Hall.Now tell me, you are a Roman Catholic priest?""Yes," he said mechanically, following her as she started away."How did you happen to get into this sort of work?""Oh, I've been at it these ten years!"he returned, now recovered from
his surprise, and pleased to talk about his work."I'd had some
experience in New York in the Bowery district.I came to the
conclusion that there were mighty few down-and-outs who couldn't be
set upon their pins again, given half a chance by any one sufficiently
interested.You see, Miss, I believe in my
fellow-men.Oh, it's only
temporary, I know.It ain't going to change the whole social system.But it helps a bit--and I like it."But," he continued more seriously, "there's going to be trouble here.And it's going to be a bad one."I've written him several times of late.But it's not
much I see he's doing, except to go on sucking the blood from these
poor devils down here!"They soon reached the tenement where Tony lived, and Carmen asked the
priest to go up with her."No," he said, "the good woman doesn't like priests.And my labors
don't reach the women anyway, except through the men.It was only by making many promises that Carmen could at last get away
from the little group on the fourth floor.But she slipped a bill into
Tony's hands as she went out, and then hurriedly crossed the hall and
opened the unlocked door of the widow Marcus's room.Carmen pinned a five-dollar bill upon the pillow and hastened
out."Now," said the priest, when the girl had joined him in the street
below, "it ain't right to take you to the Mission--"

"We'll go there first," the girl calmly announced.By the way, there's a telephone in your place?I want to call up
the health officer.I want to report the condition of these
tenements.""It won't do any good, Miss.I've camped on his
heels for months.If he
gets too troublesome to those higher up, why, he gets fired.He isn't here to report on conditions, but to
overlook 'em."You mean to say that nothing can be done in regard to those awful
buildings which Mr.Ames owns and rents to his mill hands?""It's criminal to let such buildings stand.Meanwhile, the priest was
studying his fair companion, and wondering who she might be.At length
he inquired if she had ever been in Avon before."Haven't seen Pillette's house then?He's resident manager of the Ames
mills.We can go a little out of our way and have a look at it."A few minutes later they stood at the iron gate of the manager's
residence, a massive, brown stone dwelling, set in among ancient trees
in an estate of several acres, and surrounded by shrubs and bushes."Does he know all about those tenements
down there?""Ah, that he does; and cares less.And he knows all about the terrible
hot air in his mills, and the flying lint that clogs the lungs of the
babies working there.He sees them leave the place, dripping with
perspiration, and go out into the zero temperature half naked.And
when they go off with pneumonia, well he knows why; and cares less.He
knows that the poor, tired workers in that great prison lose their
senses in the awful noise and roar, and sometimes get bewildered and
fall afoul of belts and cogs, and lose their limbs or lives.And he wouldn't put safety devices
over his machines, because he doesn't care.I've written to him a
dozen times about it.But--

"And then Pillette," he continued; "I've asked him to furnish his
hands with decent drinking water.They work ten and twelve hours in
that inferno, and when they want to drink, why, all they have is a
barrel of warm water, so covered with lint that it has to be pushed
aside in order to get at the water.Why, Pillette don't even give 'em
change rooms!He won't give 'em decent toilet rooms!Seems to me that when a man can give a ball and send
out invitations on cards of solid gold, he can afford to give a
thought to the thousands who have toiled and suffered in order to
enable him to give such a ball, don't you?"The memory came back now
in hot, searing thoughts."Oh, he catches 'em coming and going!""You see,
he manipulates Congress so that a high tariff law is passed,
protecting him from imported goods.Then he runs up the prices of his
output.That hits his mill hands, for they have to pay the higher
prices that the tariff causes.Oh, no, it doesn't result in increased
wages to them.He is
the only one who profits by high tariff on cotton goods.She might not know that Ames periodically appeared
before Congress and begged its protection--nay, threatened, and then
demanded.She might not know that Senator Gossitch ate meekly from the
great man's hand, and speciously represented to his dignified
colleagues that the benefits of high protective duties were for "the
people" of the United States.She might not know how Hood, employed to
evade the laws enacted to hedge and restrain his master, bribed and
bought, schemed and contrived, lobbied, traded, and manipulated, that
his owner might batten on his blood-stained profits, while he kept his
face turned away from the scenes of carnage, and his ears stopped
against the piteous cries of his driven slaves.But she did know how
needless it all was, and how easy, oh!how pitiably easy, it would be
to remedy every such condition, would the master but yield but a
modicum of his colossal, mesmeric selfishness.She did not know, she
could not, that the master, Ames, made a yearly profit from his mills
of more than two hundred per cent.But she did know that, were he less
stupidly greedy, even to the extent of taking but a hundred per cent
profit, he would turn a flood of sunshine into hundreds of sick,
despairing, dying souls."This is the place," she heard the priest say, his voice seeming to
come from a long distance.They were in front of an old,
two-story building, decrepit and forbidding, but well lighted.While
she gazed, the priest opened the door and bade her enter."This down here is the reading room," he explained.Upstairs is my office, and sleeping rooms for men.Also a
stock of old clothes I keep on hand for 'em when I send 'em out to
look for work.I've clothed an average of four men a day during the
past year, and sent 'em out to look for jobs.I board 'em, and keep
'em going until they land something.Sometimes I have to lend 'em
money.No, I never bother about a
man's religion.Carmen climbed the rough steps to the floor above and entered the
small but well-kept office of the priest."Now here," he said, with a touch of pride, "is my card-index.I keep
tab on all who come here.When they get straightened up and go out to
hunt work, I give 'em identification cards.Just as soon as I can get
funds I'm going to put a billiard table back there and fit up a little
chapel, so's the Catholic men who drift in here can attend service.You know, a lot of 'em don't have the nerve to go to a church.Carmen looked at the man in admiration."We haven't either of us asked the other's name," she said."I've been dying to know yours," he
replied."I'm Father Magee, Daniel Magee.Oh, give any name; it doesn't matter,
just so's I'll know how to address you."And I am from South America," said the girl
simply.*       *       *       *       *

An hour later the girl rose from her chair."I shall have to wait and
visit the Hall another time," she said."I must catch the eight-thirty
back to the city.But--"

"I'll never see you go down this tough street to the depot alone!"averred the priest, reaching for his hat.But she gratefully accepted the proffered escort.Two
of Father Magee's assistants had come in meanwhile, and were caring
for the few applicants below."You're right, Miss Carmen," the priest said, as they started for the
train.It eats my heart out to
see the suffering of these poor people!"At eleven o'clock that night Carmen entered the office of the city
editor of the Express."Ned," she said, "I've been with Dante--no,
Danny--in Inferno.I want expense
money--a good lot--so that I can leave to-morrow night."Haynerd's eyes dilated as he stared at the girl.But what did you find down in Avon?""I'll write you a detailed report of my trip to-morrow.I'm going home
now," she replied.CHAPTER 12


It is sometimes said of the man who toils at forge or loom in this
great commonwealth that he is fast forgetting that Washington is
something more significant to him than what is embraced in the
definition of the gazetteers.Not so, however, of that class of the
genus _homo_ individualized in J. Wilton Ames.He leaned not upon such
frail dependence as the _Congressional Record_ for tempered reports of
what goes on behind closed legislative doors; he went behind those
doors himself.He needed not to yield his meekly couched desires to
the law-builders whom his ballot helped select; he himself launched
those legislators, and gave them their steering charts.But, since the
interpretation of laws was to him vastly more important than their
framing, he first applied himself to the selection of judges, and
especially those of the federal courts.With these safely seated and
instructed at home, he gave himself comfortably to the task of holding
his legislators in Washington to the course he chose.Carmen had not spent a day at the Capital before the significance of
this fact to the common citizen swept over her like a tidal wave.If
the people, those upon whom the stability of the nation rests, looked
as carefully after appointments and elections as did Ames, would their
present wrongs continue long to endure?And after she
had spent the day with the Washington correspondent of the Express, a
Mr.Sands, who, with his young wife, had just removed to the Capital,
she knew more with respect to the mesmerism of human inertia and its
baneful effects upon mankind than she had known before.And yet, after that first day of wandering through the hallowed
precincts of a nation's legislative halls, she sat down upon a bench
in the shadow of the Capitol's great dome and asked herself the
questions: "What am I here for, anyway?And
instinct with her, as we have said, was unrestrained dependence upon
her own thought, the thought which entered her mentality only after
she had first prepared the way by the removal of every obstruction,
including self.At the breakfast table the second morning after her arrival in the
city, Mr.Sands handed her a copy of the Express.Among the editorials
was her full report upon conditions as she had found them in Avon,
published without her signature.Following it was the editor's
comment, merciless in its exposition of fact, and ruthless in its
exposure of the cruel greed externalized in the great cotton industry
in that little town.Carmen rose from the table indignant and protesting.Hitt had said he
would be wise in whatever use he made of her findings.But, though
quite devoid of malignity, this account and its added comment were
nothing less than a personal attack upon the master spinner, Ames.And
she had sent another report from Washington last night, one comprising
all she had learned from Mr.She
must get in touch with him at once.So she set out to find a telegraph
office, that she might check the impulsive publisher who was openly
hurling his challenge at the giant Philistine.When the message had gone, the girl dismissed the subject from her
thought, and gave herself up completely to the charm of the glorious
morning and her beautiful environment.For some time she wandered
aimlessly about the city; then bent her steps again toward the
Capitol.At the window of a florist she stopped and looked long and lovingly at
the gorgeous display within.In the midst of the beautiful profusion a
single flower held her attention.It was a great, brilliant red rose,
a kind that she had never seen before."We call it the 'President' rose, Miss," said the salesman in response
to her query.And when she went out with the splendid flower burning on her bosom
like living fire, she was glad that Hitt had not been there to see her
pay two dollars for it.The great Capitol seemed to fascinate her, as she stood before it a
few moments later.The mighty
sentiments and motives which had actuated the framers of the
Constitution seemed to loom before her like monuments of eternal
stone.Had statesmanship degenerated from that day of pure patriotism
into mere corruption?"Why, my dear girl,
the people of your great State are represented in the national Senate
by--whom?By the flies on the panes; by the mice in
the corners; by the god, perhaps, to whom the chaplain offers his
ineffectual prayers; but not by men.No; one of your Senators
represents a great railroad; the other an express company!Those Senators know no such ridiculous creature as 'the people'!"She turned from the Capitol, and for an hour or more strolled in the
brilliant sunlight."An economic disease," she murmured at length.And, like all disease, it is mental.It is a
disease of the human conscience.It comes from the fear of separation
from good.It all reduces to the belief of separation from God--the
belief that upon men's own human efforts depend all the happiness and
satisfaction they can have.Why, I have never known anything but
happiness and abundance!And yet, _I have never made a single effort
to acquire them_!"For the girl saw not the past vicissitudes of her
life except as shadowy mists, which dimmed not the sun of her joy.There was a tramping of horses' feet.It struck her, and brushed her to one side.She strove to hold
herself, but fell.The man and his companion were off their horses instantly, and
assisted the girl to her feet.asked the one who had been riding ahead."I called to
you, but you didn't seem to hear."laughed the girl, recovering her breath, and stooping to
brush the dust from her dress."Well, I'm glad to hear that!Perhaps you had better come in with
us."The girl raised her head and looked into his face with a bright smile.The man's anxious expression slowly changed into one of wonder, and
then of something quite different.The girl's long, thick hair had
been loosened by the fall, and was hanging about her shoulders.Framed
in the deep brown profusion was the fairest face he had ever looked
upon; the most winning smile; the most loving, compassionate glance."You'll have to come in now, and let the maid help you," he said
firmly."And I'll send you home in an auto."New York," replied Carmen, a little confused as she struggled vainly
with her hair."Oh, I'm not going to fuss with it any more!""Yes, I'll go with you, and let the maid do it up.She glanced about her, and then up the avenue toward which the men had
been riding.A flush suddenly spread over her face, and she turned and
looked searchingly at the man."You--you--live--in--there?"she stammered, pointing toward the
distant house."And you are--"

"Yes," he replied, coming to her assistance, but evidently greatly
enjoying her embarrassment, "I am the President."Then her hand stole mechanically to the rose flaming upon her bosom."I--I guess I know why I bought this now," she said softly.Quickly
unpinning it, she extended it to the man."I was bringing it to you,
wasn't I?"The picture was one that would have rejoiced an artist: the simple
girl, with her tumbled hair and wonderful face, standing there in the
glorious sunlight, holding out a single rose to the chief executive of
a great nation.The President bowed low and took the proffered flower.But the one who gives it is far more so."Then he bade his companion take the two horses to the stable, and
motioned to Carmen to accompany him."I was just returning from my morning ride," he began again, "when you
happened--"

"Things _never_ happen," interrupted the girl gently.He looked at her with a little quizzical side glance."Then you didn't
happen to be in the way?""I was obeying the law of cause and
effect.""A desire to see you, I guess.Or, perhaps, the _necessity_ of seeing
you.And because I wanted to see you in the interests of good, why,
evil seemed to try to run over me.""But why should you wish to see me?""Because you are the head of a wonderful nation.Then:

"You came down from New York to talk with me?""I think I came all the way from South America to see you," she said.There is a revolution in progress down there now.Did you
come to see me about that?I can do nothing--"

The girl shook her head."No," she said, "it's to prevent a revolution
here in your own country that I think I have come to see you."They had by now reached the door of the Executive Mansion.Entering,
the President summoned a maid, and turned the big-eyed girl over to
her."Bring her to my office," he directed, "when she is ready."A little later the nameless girl from Simiti again stood before the
President of the United States."I have an important conference at ten," he said, glancing at a clock."But we have a few minutes before that time.Will you--may I ask you
to tell me something about yourself?"he added, looking
apprehensively at her while he set out a chair.The girl drew the chair close to his desk and sat down."I know
nothing about accidents," she said quietly.Then, turning quite from
that topic, she drew the President quickly into her thought and
carried him off with her as on a magic carpet.From time to time he turned and
stared at his strange visitor.At other times he made notes of points
which impressed him.Once he interrupted, when she made reference to
her past life."This priest, Jose de Rincon, might he not have been
imprisoned as a political offender?""I do not know," the girl replied tenderly."My foster-father,
Rosendo, did not mention him in the two letters which I have
received."The President nodded; and the girl went rapidly on.Soon she was deep
in the problem presented by Avon.But at the mention of that town, and of its dominating genius, the
President seemed to become nervous.At length he raised a hand, as if
to end the interview."I fear I can do nothing at present," he said with an air of
helplessness."But," she protested, "you have the public welfare at heart.And can
you not see that public welfare is the welfare of each individual?"Ames well," the President replied, somewhat irrelevantly."He, like all men of great wealth, presents a serious problem,
doubtless.But he himself, likewise, is confronted by problems of very
trying natures.We must give him time to work them out.""It's like getting at the essence of Christianity,"
she said."The world has had nearly two thousand years in which to do
that, but it hasn't made much of a start as yet."But," the President resumed reflectively, "after all, it is the
people who are wholly responsible for the conditions which exist among
them.They have the means of remedying every economic situation, the
ballot.It is really all in their hands, is it not?They elect their
public officers, their judges, and their lawmakers.""You too," she said, "take refuge in the cant
of the age.Yes, the people do try to elect public servants; but by
some strange anomaly the servant becomes master the moment he enters
the door of office.And then
they, and you, sit helplessly back and cry, No use!And if the people
rise, their servants meet them with a hail of lead.It's really
childishly ridiculous, isn't it?when you stop to consider it
seriously."She leaned her elbows upon the desk, and sat with chin in her hands,
looking squarely into the eyes of the President."So you, the head of this great nation, confess to utter helplessness,"
she slowly said.A servant entered at that moment with a card.The President glanced at
it, and bade him request the caller to wait a few moments.Then, after
some reflection:

"The people will always--"

The door through which the servant had passed was abruptly thrown
open, and a harsh voice preceded the entrance of a huge bulk."I am not accustomed to being told to wait, Mr.President," said the
ungracious voice."My appointment was for ten o'clock, and I am here
to keep it."Then the newcomer stopped abruptly, and stared in amazement at the
young girl, sitting with her elbows propped upon the desk, and her
face close to that of the President.His
attention was centered upon the girl who sat looking calmly up at him.A dark, menacing scowl drew his bushy eyebrows together, and made the
sinister look which mantled his face one of ominous import to the
person upon whom it fell.Carmen was the first to break the tense silence.With a bright smile
illuming her face she rose and held out a hand to the giant before
her."We meet pretty often, don't
we?"Ames ignored both the greeting and the extended hand.Turning upon the
President, he said sharply: "So, the Express seeks aid in the White
House, eh?"Ames," said Carmen quickly, answering for the President."It
seeks to aid the White House.""Might I ask," he said in a tone of mordant
sarcasm, "how you learned that I was to be here this morning?I would
like to employ your methods of espionage in my own business.""I would give anything if you _would_ employ my methods in your
business," returned the girl gently.The President looked in embarrassment from one to the other."I think,
Miss Carmen," he said, "that we must consider our interview ended.A peculiar expression had come into Ames's features.President," he said in a tone pregnant with
meaning."I am glad to have a representative of the New York press
with us to hear you express your attitude toward the cotton
schedule."His
indignation mounted, but he checked it."The schedule has been reported out of committee," he replied briefly."I am aware of that," said Ames."And your influence with Congress in
regard to it?""Shall the Avon mills be closed pending a decision?Or, on the
assumption that Congress will uphold the altered schedule, must the
Spinners' Association begin immediate retrenchment?As president of
that Association, I ask for instructions.""My influence with Congress, as you well know, Mr.Ames, is quite
limited," replied the hectored executive."It is not a question of the _amount_ of your influence with that
body, Mr.President," returned Ames coldly, "but of how you will
employ that which you have."Silence lay upon them all for some moments.Then Ames resumed:

"I would remind you," he remarked with cruel insinuation, "that--or,"
glancing at the girl, "perhaps I should not make this public."He
paused and awaited the effect of his significant words upon the
President.Then, as the latter remained silent, he went on evenly:

"Second-term prospects, you are aware, are often very greatly
influenced by public facts regarding the first election.Of course we
are saying nothing that the press might use, but--well, you must
realize that there is some suspicion current as to the exact manner in
which your election was--"

"I think you wish to insinuate that my election was due to the
Catholic vote, which you controlled in New York, and to your very
generous campaign contributions, do you not?I see no reason for
withholding from the press your views on the subject.""But, my friend, this is an age of investigation, and of suspicion
toward all public officials.And such rumors wouldn't look well on the
front pages of the press throughout the country.Of course, our young
friend here isn't going to mention them to her superiors; but,
nevertheless, they ought to be suppressed at once.Their effect upon
your second-term prospects would be simply annihilating.Now I am in a
position to greatly assist in the matter of--well, in fact, I have
already once offered my aid to the Express.And I stand ready now to
join with it in giving the lie to those who are seeking to embarrass
the present administration.Miss Carmen is with us--"

"Mr.Ames," the girl quietly interrupted, "I wish _you_ were with
_us_.""But, my dear girl, have I--"

"For then there would be no more suffering in Avon," she added.Then it was you who wrote that misleading stuff in the Express,
eh?May I ask," he added with a contemptuous
sneer, "by whose authority you have visited the houses occupied by my
tenants, without my permission or knowledge?I take it you were down
there, although the cloudy weather must have quite dimmed your
perception.""Yes," she answered in a low voice, "I have been there.Yes, I visited your charnel houses and your cemeteries.I held their trembling hands, and stroked their
hot brows.I fed them, and gave them the promise that I would plead
their cause with you."But you first come here to--"

"It was with no thought of seeing you that I came to Washington, Mr.If I cross your path often, it must be for a purpose not yet
revealed to either of us.Perhaps it is to warn you, to awaken you, if
not too late, to a sense of your desperate state."You are drunk, you know, drunk with greed.And such continuous
drunkenness has made you sick unto death.It is the same dread disease
of the soul that the wicked Cortez told the bewildered Mexicans he
had, and that could be cured only with gold.Ames, that you are mesmerized by the evil which is always using you."She stood close to the huge man, and looked straight up into his face.He remained for a moment motionless, yielding again to that
fascination which always held him when in her presence, and of which
he could give no account to himself.That slight, girlish figure--how
easily he could crush her!"But you couldn't, you know," she said cryptically, as she shook her
head.He recoiled a step, struck by the sudden revelation that the girl had
read his thought.Ames," she continued, "what a craven error is before
truth.It makes a coward of you, doesn't it?Your boasted power is
only a mesmerism, which you throw like a huge net over your victims.You and they can break it, if you will.""We really must consider our
interview ended."I guess the appointment was made for to-day," the girl said softly."And by a higher power than any of us.Ames is the type of man who
is slowly turning our Republican form of government into a despotism
of wealth.He boasts that his power is already greater than a czar's.You bow before it; and so the awful monster of privilege goes on
unhampered, coiling its slimy tentacles about our national resources,
our public utilities, and natural wealth.I--I can't see how you, the
head of this great nation, can stand trembling by and see him do it.He made as if to reply, but restrained himself.A stern look then came into the
President's face.Then he
turned again to his desk and sat down."Please be seated," he said, "both of you.I don't know what quarrel
there is between you two, and I am not interested in it.But you, Miss
Carmen, represent the press; Mr.The things which have
been voiced here this morning must remain with us alone.Now let us
see if we can not meet on common ground.Is the attitude of your
newspaper, Miss Carmen, one of hostility toward great wealth?""The Express raises its voice only against the folly and wickedness of
the human mind, not against personality," replied the girl.We attack only the human thought which manifests in him.We
oppose the carnal thought which expresses itself in the folly, the
madness of strife for excessive wealth.It is that strife that makes
our hospitals and asylums a disgraceful necessity.It makes the
immigrant hordes of Europe flock here because they are attracted by
the horrible social system which fosters the growth of great fortunes
and makes their acquisition possible.Our alms-houses and prisons
increase in number every year.It is because rich men misuse their
wealth, trample justice under foot, and prostitute a whole nation's
conscience."They do not all--"

"It is a law of human thought," said Carmen in reply, "that mankind in
time become like that which has absorbed their attention.Rich men
obey this law with utmost precision.They acquire the nature and
character of their god, gold.They rapidly grow to be like that which
they blindly worship.They grow
metallic, yellow, calloused, unchanging, and soulless, like the coins
they heap up.There is the great danger to our country, Mr.And it is against the human thought that produces such beings--thought
stamped with the dollar mark--that the Express opposes itself."She hesitated, and looked in the direction of Ames.Then she added:

"Their features in time reveal to the world their metallic thought.Their veins shrivel with the fiery lust of gold.And then, at last, they crumble and sink into the dust of
which their god is made.And still their memories continue to poison
the very sources of our national existence.You see," she concluded,
"there is no fool so mired in his folly as the man who gives his soul
for great wealth.""A very enjoyable little sermon, preached for my benefit, Miss
Carmen," interposed Ames, bowing to her."And now if you have finished
excoriating my poor character," he continued dryly, "will you kindly
state by whose authority you publish to the world my affairs?"The maudlin sentimentalism of such as you make us all suffer!""Hadn't we better sing a hymn
now?You'll be wiser in a few years, I hope."Ames, by what right you own
mines, and forests, and lands?"By the divine right of law, most assuredly," he retorted.I have learned," she
continued, turning to the President, "that a bare handful of men own
or control all the public utilities of this great country.But," abruptly, "you believe in God, don't you?"He nodded his head, although with some embarrassment.His religion
labored heavily under political bias.She looked down at the floor, and sat silent for a while."Divine
right," she began to murmur, "the fetish of the creatures made rich by
our man-made social system!'The heavens are thine, the earth also is
thine: as for the world and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded
them.'But, oh, what must be the concept of God held by the rich, a
God who bestows these gifts upon a few, and with them the privilege
and divine consent to oppress and crush their fellow-men!What a low
order of intelligence the rich possess!An intelligence wherein the
sentiments of love and justice have melted into money!"President," put in Ames at this juncture, "I think we have spent
quite enough time moralizing.Suppose you now indicate your attitude
on the cotton tariff.Her sparkling eyes looked right into the
President's."I admire the man," she said,
"who dares to stand for the right in the face of the great taboo!There are few men nowadays who stand for anything in particular."exclaimed Ames, aware now that he had made a mistake in
permitting the girl to remain, "I wish my interview to be with you
alone, Mr."I have embarrassed you both, haven't I?"But first--"

She went to Ames and laid a hand on his arm."I wish--I wish I might
awaken you," she said gently."There is no victim at Avon in so
desperate a state as you.More gold will not cure you, any more than
more liquor can cure a slave to strong drink.You do not know that you
are hourly practicing the most despicable form of robbery, the
wringing of profits which you do not need out of the dire necessities
of your fellow-beings."She stopped and smiled down into the face of the man.This girl always dissected his soul with a smile on
her face."I wish I might awaken you and your poor victims by showing you and
them that righteousness makes not for a home in the skies, but for
greater happiness and prosperity for everybody right here in this
world.Don't you really want the little babies to have enough to eat
down there at Avon?Do you really want the President to support you in
the matter of the cotton schedule, and so increase the misery and
sorrow at your mills?that one's greatest
happiness is found only in that of others."She stood looking at him
for a few moments, then turned away.The President rose and held out his hand to her.She almost laughed as
she took it, and her eyes shone with the light of her eager, unselfish
desire."I--I guess I'm like Paul," she said, "consumed with zeal.Anyway,
you'll wear my rose, won't you?""And--you are not a bit afraid about a second term, are you?As for
party principle, why, you know, there is only _one_ principle, God.He
is the Christ-principle, you know, and that is way above party
principle."Under the spell of the girl's strange words every emotion fled from
the men but that of amazement."Righteousness, you know, is right-thinking.And that touches just
that about which men are most chary, their pocketbooks."Then she arched her brows and said naively:
"You will find in yesterday's Express something about Avon.You will
not use your influence with Congress until you have read it, will
you?"A deep quiet fell upon the men, upon the great executive and the great
apostle of privilege.It seemed to the one that as the door closed
against that bright presence the spirit of night descended; the other
sat wrapped in the chaos of conflicting emotions in which she always
left him."She's the bastard daughter of a <DW64> priest," replied Ames in an
ugly tone.cried the thoroughly angered Ames, bringing a huge
fist down hard upon the desk.And, what's
more, she's head over heels in love with another renegade priest!"But that's neither here nor there," he continued savagely."I want to
know what you are going to do for us?""I--I do not see, Mr.Ames, that I can do anything," replied the
President meditatively."Well--will you leave the details to us, and do as we tell you then?"the financier pursued, taking another tack."Yes--about the girl, you--"

"Damn the girl!""I've got proofs that will ruin
her, and you too--and, by God, I'll use 'em, if you drive me to it!You seem to forget that you were elected to do our bidding, my
friend!"For a long time he sat
staring at the floor."It was wonderful," he said,
"wonderful the way she faced you, like David before Goliath!There
isn't a vestige of fear in her make-up.I--we'll talk this matter over
some other time, Mr.roared Ames, his self-control flying to the
winds."I can ruin you--make your administration a laughing-stock--and
plunge this country into financial panic!Do you do as I say, or
not?"The President looked the angry man squarely in the eyes."I do not,"
he answered quietly.CHAPTER 13


"It's corking!cried Haynerd, when he and Hitt had
finished reading Carmen's report on her first few days in Washington."Makes a fellow feel as if the best thing Congress could do would be
to adjourn for about fifty years, eh?But
she's a wonder, Hitt!And she's booming the Express to the skies!That's why she is so--as the
Mexicans say--_simpatico_.""Well, not with you, I hope!""No, unfortunately," replied Haynerd, assuming a dejected mien, "but
with that Rincon fellow--and he a priest!He's got a son down in
Cartagena somewhere, and he doesn't write to her either.She's told
Sid the whole story, and he's working it up into a book during his odd
moments.But, say," turning the conversation again into its original
channel, "how much of her report are we going to run?You know, she
tried to head us off.As if she
hadn't already attacked him and strewn him all over the field!""We'll have to be careful in our allusions to the President," replied
Hitt."I'll rewrite it myself, so as not to offend her or him.her reports are the truth, and they rightfully
belong to the people!The Express is the avowed servant of the
public!I see no reason for
concealing a thing.Did I tell you that I had two inquiries from
Italian and German papers, asking permission to translate her reports
into their own columns?"Did you wire her to see
Gossitch and Mall?""Yes, and Logue, as well as others.And I've put dozens of senators
and congressmen on our mailing list, including the President himself.I've prepared letters for each one of them, calling attention to the
girl and her unique reports.She certainly writes in a fascinating
vein, doesn't she?Meanwhile, she's circulating around down there and
advertising us in the best possible manner.he finished, slapping the city editor roundly upon the back."Confine your enthusiasm to words, my
friend.Say, what did you do about that liquid food advertisement?""Discovered that it was beer," replied Hitt, "and turned it firmly
down."Not that we care to advertise it, but--"

Hitt laughed."When that fellow Claus smoothly tried to convince me
that beer was a food, I sent a sample of his stuff to the Iles
chemical laboratory for analysis.They reported ninety-four per cent
water, four per cent alcohol--defined now as a poisonous drug--and
about two per cent of possible food substance.If the beer had been of
the first grade there wouldn't have been even the two per cent of
solids.You know, I couldn't help thinking of what Carmen said about
the beer that is advertised in brown bottles to preserve it from the
deleterious effects of light.Light, you know, starts decay in beer.Well, light, according to Fuller, is 'God's eldest daughter.'Emerson
says it is the first of painters, and that there is nothing so foul
that intense light will not make it beautiful.Thus the light of truth destroys the fermentation which
is supposed to constitute the human mind and body.So light tries to
purify beer by breaking it up.The brewers have to put it into brown
bottles to preserve its poisonous qualities.As Carmen says, beer
simply can't stand the light.It's astonishing that so many so-called reputable papers will
take their advertising stuff.It's just as bad as patent medicine
ads."And I note that the American public still spend their annual
hundred million dollars for patent medicine dope.Most of this is
spent by women, who are largely caught by the mail-order trade.I
learned of one exposure recently made where it was found that a widely
advertised eye wash was composed of borax and water.The cost was
somewhere about five cents a gallon, and it sold for a dollar an
ounce.Nice little profit of some two hundred and fifty thousand per
cent, and all done by the mesmerism of suggestive advertising.Speaking of parasites on
society, Ames is not the only one!""And yet those fellows howl and threaten us with the boycott because
we won't advertise their lies and delusions.It's as bad as
ecclesiastical intolerance!"Then she returned to New York and
went directly to Avon.What she did there can only be surmised by a
study of her reports to Hitt, who carefully edited them and ran them
in the Express.Again, after several days, she journeyed back to
Washington.Her enthusiasm was boundless; her energy exhaustless; her
industry ceaseless; and her persistency doggedly unshakable.In
Washington she made her way unhindered among those whom she deemed
essential to the work which she was doing.Doubtless her ability to do
this and to gain an audience with whomsoever she might choose was in
great part due to her beauty and charming simplicity, her grace of
manner, and her wonderful and fearless innocence, combined with a
mentality remarkable for its matured powers.Hitt and Haynerd groaned
over her expenses, but promptly met them."She's worth it," growled the latter one day."She's had four
different talks with the President!How on earth do you suppose she
does it?And how did she get Mall and Logue to take her to dinner and
to the theater again and again?And what did she do to induce that
doddering old blunderbuss, Gossitch, to tell her what Ames was up to?How do you suppose she found out that
Ames was hand in glove with the medical profession, and working tooth
and nail to help them secure a National Bureau of Health?Say, do you
know what that would do?It would foist allopathy upon every chick and
child of us!Have
we come to that in this supposedly free country?By the way, Hitt,
Doctor Morton has been let out of the University.He says Ames
did it because of his association with us."I think, my friend," replied Hitt, "that it is a very serious matter,
and one that impinges heavily upon the rights of every one of us, when
a roaring lion like Ames is permitted to run loose through our
streets."I've centered my hopes in Carmen," sighed Haynerd.If she can't stop him, then God himself can't!"A few moments later he came out
again and handed an opened letter to Haynerd."Some notes she's sent
from Washington.Mentions the National Bureau of Health project.It
hasn't escaped her, you see.Say, will you tell me where she picks up
her information?""The Lord gives it to her, I guess," said Haynerd, glancing over the
letter."'Reverend Borwell and Doctor Siler are down here lobbying for the
  National Bureau of Health bill.Also, Senator Gossitch dropped a
  remark to me yesterday which makes me believe that he and other
  Senators have been approached by Tetham with reference to sending
  an American ambassador to the Vatican.Haynerd handed the letter back to Hitt and plunged into the papers on
his desk."This
country's going stark, staring mad!We're crazy, every mother's son of
us!""It's the human mind that is crazy, Ned, because it is wholly without
any basis of principle," returned Hitt with a sigh.*       *       *       *       *

"Doctor Siler!exclaimed that worthy person, looking up from
the gutter, whither he had hastened after his silk hat which had been
knocked off by the encounter with the young girl who had rounded the
corner of Ninth street into Pennsylvania avenue and plunged full into
him."Oh, I'm so sorry, Doctor!I was coming from the Smithsonian
Institution, and I guess--"

"Don't mention it, Miss Carmen.It's a privilege to have my hat
knocked off by such a radiant creature as you."And I want to offer
my--"

"Look here, Miss Carmen, just offer yourself as my guest at luncheon,
will you?That will not only make amends, but place me hopelessly in
your debt.""I was on my way to a
restaurant."I've got a little place around the corner here
that would have made Epicurus sit up nights inditing odes to it."The girl laughed merrily, and slipped her arm through his.A few
minutes later they were seated at a little table in a secluded corner
of the doctor's favorite chophouse."By the way, I met a friend of yours a few minutes ago," announced the
doctor, after they had given their orders."He was coming out of the
White House, and--were you ever in a miniature cyclone?That's twice to-day I've been sent to the gutter!"He laughed heartily
over his experiences, then added significantly: "You and he are both
mental cyclones, but producing diametrically opposite effects."The doctor went on chatting
volubly."Ames and the President don't seem to be pulling together
as well as usual.The President has come out squarely against him
now in the matter of the cotton schedule.Ames declares that the
result will be a general financial panic this fall.Sands, the Express correspondent, seems to be getting mighty close
to administration affairs these days.Where did he get that data
regarding a prospective National Bureau of Health, do you suppose?""I gave it to him," was the simple reply.The doctor dropped his fork, and stared at the girl."Well--of course you naturally would be opposed to it.But--"

"Tell me," she interrupted, "tell me candidly just what you doctors
are striving for, anyway.Are your activities
all quite utilitarian, or--is it money and monopoly that you are
after?It makes a lot of difference, you know, in one's attitude
toward you.If you really seek the betterment of health, then you are
only honestly mistaken in your zeal.But if you are doing this to make
money--and I think you are--then you are a lot of rascals, deserving
defeat.""Miss Carmen, do you impugn my motives?"He began to color slightly under her keen
scrutiny."Well," she finally continued, "let's see.If you doctors
have made the curative arts effective, and if you really do heal
disease, then I must support you, of course.But, while there is
nothing quite so important to the average mortal as his health, yet I
know that there is hardly anything that has been dealt with in such a
bungling way.The art of healing as employed by our various schools of
medicine to-day is the result of ages and ages of experimentation and
bitter experience, isn't it?And its cost in human lives is simply
incalculable.No science is so speculative, none so hypothetical, as
the so-called science of medicine.""But we have had to learn," protested the doctor."Do you realize, Doctor," she resumed, "that the teaching and
preaching of disease for money is one of the greatest curses resting
upon the world to-day?I never saw a doctor until I was on the boat
coming to New York.And then I thought he was one of the greatest
curiosities I had ever seen.I followed him about and listened to him
talk to the passengers.And I learned that, like most of our young
men, he had entered the practice of medicine under the pressure of
dollars rather than altruism.Money is still the determining factor in
the choice of a profession by our young men.And success and fortune
in the medical profession, more than in any other, depend upon the
credulity of the ignorant and helpless human mind.""Do you deny that great progress has been made in the curative arts?""See what we have done with diphtheria, with typhoid,
with smallpox, and malaria!""Surely, Doctor, you can not believe that the mere temporary removing
of a disease is _real_ healing!You render one lot of microbes
innocuous, after thousands of years of experimentation, and leave
mankind subject to the rest.Do
you expect to go on that way, making set after set of microbes
harmless to the human body, and thus in time, after millions of years,
eradicate disease entirely?Do you think that people will then cease
to die?All the time you are working only in matter and through
material modes.Do you expect thereby to render the human sense of
life immortal?Your patients
get well, only to fall sick again.And death to you is still as
inevitable as ever, despite your boasted successes, is it not so?"He broke into a bantering laugh, but did not reply."Doctor, the human mind is self-inoculated.It will keep on
making them, until it is educated out of itself, and taught to do
better.Then it will give place to the real reflection of divine mind;
and human beings will be no more.Why don't you realize this, you
doctors, and get started on the right track?Your real work is in the
_mental_ realm."Well, I for one have little respect for faith cure--"

"Nor I," she interposed."Dependence upon material drugs, Doctor, is
reliance upon the _phenomena_ of the human mind.Faith cure is
dependence upon the human mind itself, upon the _noumenon_, instead of
the _phenomenon_.Hypnotism is mental
suggestion, the suggestions being human and material, not divine
truth.The drugging system is an outgrowth of the belief of life in
matter.Faith cure is the belief of life and power inherent in the
human mind.The origin of healing is
shrouded in mythology, and every step of its so-called progress has
been marked by superstition, dense ignorance, and fear.The first
doctor that history records was the Shaman, or medicine-man, whose
remedies reflected his mental status, and later found apt illustration
in the brew concocted by Macbeth's witches.And think you he has
disappeared?Unbelievable as it may seem, it was only a short time ago
that a case was reported from New York where the skin of a freshly
killed black cat was applied as a remedy for an ailment that had
refused to yield to the prescribed drugging!And only a few years ago
some one applied to the Liverpool museum for permission to touch a
sick child's head with one of the prehistoric stone axes there
exhibited.""That was mere superstition," retorted the doctor."But _materia medica_ is superstition incarnate.And because of the superstition that life and virtue and power are
resident in matter, mankind have swallowed nearly everything known to
material sense, in the hope that it would cure them of their own
auto-infection.You remember what awful recipes Luther gave for
disease, and his exclamation of gratitude: 'How great is the mercy of
God who has put such healing virtue in all manner of muck!'""Miss Carmen," resumed the doctor, "we physicians are workers, not
theorists.We handle conditions as we find them, not as they ought to
be.""You handle conditions as the
human, mortal mind believes them to be, that's all.You accept its
ugly pictures as real, and then you try desperately through
legislation to make us all accept them.Yet you would bitterly resent
it if some religious body should try to legislate its beliefs upon
you."Now listen, you doctors are rank materialists.Perhaps it is because,
as Hawthorne puts it, in your researches into the human frame your
higher and more subtle faculties are materialized, and you lose the
spiritual view of existence.Your only remedy for diseased matter is
more matter.Why, ignorance and
superstition have given rise to by far the larger number of remedies
in use by you to-day!And all of your attempts to rationalize medicine
and place it upon a systematic basis have signally failed, because the
only curative property a drug has is the credulity of the person who
swallows it.And that is a factor which varies with the individual.""The most advanced physicians give little medicine nowadays, Miss
Carmen.""They are beginning to get away from it, little by little," she
replied."In recent years it has begun to dawn upon doctors and
patients alike that the sick who recover do so, not because of the
drugs which they have taken, but _in spite of them_!One of the most
prominent of our contemporary physicians who are getting away from the
use of drugs has said that eighty-five per cent of all illnesses get
well of their own accord, no matter what may or may not be done for
them.In a very remarkable article from this same doctor's pen, in
which he speaks of the huge undertaking which physicians must assume
in order to clear away the _materia medica_ rubbish of the ages, he
states that the greatest struggle which the coming doctor has on his
hands is with drugs, and the deadly grip which they have on the
confidence and affections both of the profession and of the public.Among his illuminating remarks about the drug system, I found two
drastic statements, which should serve to lift the veil from the eyes
of the chronic drug taker.These are, first, 'Take away opium and
alcohol, and the backbone of the patent medicine business would be
broken inside of forty-eight hours,' and, second, 'No drug, save
quinine and mercury in special cases, will cure a disease.'In words
which he quotes from another prominent physician, 'He is the best
doctor who knows the worthlessness of most drugs.'"The hundreds of drugs listed in books on _materia medica_ I find are
gradually being reduced in number to a possible forty or fifty, and
one doctor makes the radical statement that they can be cut down to
the'six or seven real drugs.'Still further light has been thrown
upon the debasing nature of the drugging system by a member of the
Philadelphia Drug Exchange, in a recent hearing before the House
Committee on municipal affairs right here.He is reported as saying
that it makes little difference what a manufacturer puts into a patent
medicine, for, after all, the effect of the medicine depends upon the
faith of the user.The sick man who turns to patent medicines for
relief becomes the victim of 'bottled faith.'If his faith is
sufficiently great, a cure may be effected--and the treatment has been
_wholly mental_!The question of ethics does not concern either the
patent medicine manufacturer or the druggist, for they argue that if
the sick man's faith has been aroused to the point of producing a
cure, the formula of the medicine itself is of no consequence, and,
therefore, if a solution of sugar and water sold as a cure for colds
can stimulate the sufferer's faith to the point of meeting his need,
the business is quite legitimate.'A bunch of bottles and sentiment,'
adds this member of the Drug Exchange, 'are the real essentials for
working healing miracles.'"exclaimed the doctor, again sitting back and regarding her with
amazement."But, Doctor, I am intensely interested in my fellow-men.I want to
help them, and show them how to learn to live.""And I am doing all I can, the very best I
know how to do.""I guess you mean you are doing what you are prompted to do by every
vagrant impulse that happens to stray into your mentality, aren't
you?""You haven't really seriously thought out your
way, else you would not be here now urging Congress to spread a
blanket of ignorance over the human mind.If you will reflect
seriously, if you will lay aside monetary considerations, and a little
of the hoary prejudice of the ages, and will carefully investigate our
present medical systems, you will find a large number of schools of
medicine, bitterly antagonistic to one another, and each accusing the
other of inferiority as an exact science, and as grossly ignorant and
reprehensibly careless of life.But which of these warring schools can
show the greatest number of cures is a bit of data that has never been
ascertained.A recent writer says: 'As important as we all realize
health to be, the public is receiving treatment that is anything but
scientific, and the amount of unnecessary suffering that is going on
in the world is certainly enough to make a rock shed tears.'He
further says that, 'at least seventy-five per cent of the people we
meet who are apparently well, are suffering from some chronic ailment
that regular medical systems can not cure,' and that many of these
would try further experimentation were it not for the criticism that
is going on in the medical world regarding various curative systems.The only hope under the drugging system is that the patient's life and
purse may hold out under the strain of trying everything until he can
light upon the right thing before he reaches the end of the list.""And do you include surgery in your general criticism?""Surgery is no less an outgrowth of the belief of sentient matter than
is the drugging system," she replied."It is admittedly necessary in
the present stage of the world's thought; but it is likewise admitted
to be 'the very uncertain art of performing operations,' at least
ninety per cent of which are wholly unnecessary."You see," she went on, "the effect upon the _moral_ nature of the
sick man is never considered as rightfully having any influence upon
the choice of the system to be employed.If Beelzebub can cast out
demons, why not employ him?For, after all, the end to be attained is
the ejection of the demon.And if God had not intended minerals and
plants to be used as both food and medicine, why did He make them?Besides, man must earn his bread in some way under our present crude
and inhuman social system, and if the demand for drugs exists we may
be very sure it will be supplied by others, if not by ourselves.Again, the influence of commercialism as a determining factor in the
choice of a profession, is an influence that works to keep many in the
practice of a profession that they know to be both unscientific and
harmful.The result is an inevitable lowering of ideals to the lust of
material accumulation.""You certainly are hard on us poor doctors!And
we have done so much for you, too, despite your accusations.Think of
the babies that are now saved from diphtheria alone!""And think of the children who are the victims of the medical mania!""Think how they are brought up under the tyranny of
fear!Fear of this and of that; fear that if they scratch a finger
blood poisoning will deprive them of life; fear that eating a bit of
this will cause death; or sitting in a breeze will result in wasting
sickness!As for diphtheria antitoxin, it is in the
same class as the white of an egg.It is the
result of human belief, the belief that a horse that has recovered
from diphtheria can never again be poisoned by the microbe of that
disease.The microbe, Doctor, is the externalization in the human
mentality of the mortal beliefs of fear, of life and power in matter,
and of disease and death.The microbe will be subject, therefore, to
the human mind's changing thought regarding it, always.""Well then," said the doctor, "if people are spiritual, and if they
really are a consciousness, as you say, why do we seem to be carrying
about a body with us all the time--a body from which we are utterly
unable to get away?""It is because the mortal mind and body are one, Doctor.The body is
a lower stratum of the human mind.Hence, the so-called mind is
never distinct from its body to the extent of complete separation,
but always has its substratum with it.And, Doctor, the mind can not
hold a single thought without that thought tending to become
externalized--as Professor James tells us--and the externalization
generally has to do with the body, for the mind has come to center
all its hopes of happiness and pleasure in the body, and to base its
sense of life upon it.The body, being a mental concept formed of
false thought, passes away, from sheer lack of a definite principle
upon which to rest.Therefore the sense of life embodied in it passes
away with it.You know, the ancients had some idea of the cause of
disease when they attributed it to demons, for demons at least are
mental influences.But then, after that, men began to believe that
disease was sent by God, either to punish them for their evil deeds,
or to discipline and train them for paradise.Think
of regarding pain and suffering as divine agents!I don't wonder
people die, do you?Humboldt, you know, said: 'The time will come
when it will be considered a disgrace for a man to be sick, when the
world will look upon it as a misdemeanor, the result of some
vicious thinking.'Many people seem to think that thought affects
only the brain; but the fact is that _we think all over_!""But look here," put in the doctor."Here's a question I intended to
ask Hitt the other night.He said the five physical senses did not
testify truly.Well now, if, as you say, the eyes do not testify to
disease, then they can't testify to cures either, eh?"He sat back
with an air of triumph."The physical senses testify only to
belief.In the case of sickness, they testify to false belief.In the
case of a cure, they testify to a changed belief, to a belief of
recovered health, that is all.It is all on the basis of human belief,
you see."But--nerves feel--"

"Nerves, Doctor, like all matter, are externalizations of human
thought.Can the externalization of thought talk back to thought?You are still on the basis of mere human belief."At that moment the doctor leaned over and tapped upon the window to
attract the attention of some one in the street.Carmen looked out and
caught sight of a tall, angular man dressed in clerical garb.The man
bowed pleasantly to the doctor, and cast an inquiring glance at the
girl, then passed on."Yes, Tetham," said the doctor."Oh, is that the man who maintains the lobby here at the Capital for
his Church?He--well, it is his business to see
that members of his Church are promoted to political office, isn't it?He trades votes of whole districts to various congressmen in return
for offices for strong church members.He also got the parochial
schools of New York exempt from compulsory vaccination.The
Express--"

"Eh?Wales in his work on the cotton schedule.And so
we heard from Father Tetham.He is supporting the National Bureau of
Health bill.He is working for the Laetare medal.He--"

"Say, Miss Carmen, will you tell me where you pick up your news?Do you know something about everybody here in
Washington?""I have learned much here," she said, "about popular
government as exemplified by these United States.But it is especially saddening to see our
constitutional liberties threatened by this Bureau of Health bill, and
by the Government's constant truckling to the Church of Rome.Doctor,
can it be that you want to commit this nation to the business of
practicing medicine, and to its practice according to the allopathic,
or'regular' school?The American Medical Association, with its
reactionary policies and repressive tendencies, is making strenuous
endeavors to influence Congress to enact certain measures which would
result in the creation of such a Department of Health, the effect of
which would be to monopolize the art of healing and to create a
'healing trust.'If this calamity should be permitted to come upon the
American people, it would fall as a curtain of ignorance and
superstition over our fair land, and shut out the light of the dawning
Sun of Truth.It would mean a reversion to the blight and mold of the
Middle Ages, in many respects a return in a degree to the ignorance
and tyranny that stood for so many centuries like an impassable rock
in the pathway of human progress.The attempt to foist upon a
progressive people a system of medicine and healing which is wholly
unscientific and uncertain in its effects, but which is admittedly
known to be responsible for the death of millions and for untold
suffering and misery, and then to say, '_Thou shalt be cured thereby,
or not be cured at all_,' is an insult to the intelligence of the
Fathers of our liberties, and a crime upon a people striving for the
light.It smacks of the Holy Inquisition: You accept our creed, or you
shall go to hell--after we have broken you on the rack!Why, the
thought of subjecting this people to years of further dosing and
experimentation along the materialistic lines of the'regular' school,
of curtailing their liberties, and forcing their necks under the yoke
of medical tyranny, should come to them with the insistence of a
clarion call, and startle them into such action that the subtle evil
which lurks behind this proposed legislative action would be dragged
out into the light and exterminated!To permit commercialism and
greed, the lust of mammon, and the pride of the flesh that expresses
itself in the demand, 'Who shall be greatest?'to dictate the course
of conduct that shall shape the destinies of a great people, is to
admit the failure of free government, and to revert to a condition of
mind that we had thought long since outgrown.To yield our dear-bought
liberties to Italian ecclesiastics, on the other hand--well, Doctor,
_it is just unthinkable_!"Well, at least you are delightfully frank with me.Yet you have
the effect of making me feel as if--as if I were in some way behind a
veil.That--"

"Well, the human mind is very decidedly behind a veil--indeed, behind
many of them.Mankind just grope
about all their lives back of these veils, not knowing that God is
right before them all the time.God has got to be everything, or else
He will be nothing.With or without drugs, it is God 'who healeth all
thy diseases.'The difficulty with physicians is that they are densely
ignorant of what healing means, and so they always start with a
dreadful handicap.They believe that there is something real to be
overcome--and of course fail to permanently overcome it.Many of them
are not only pitiably ignorant, but are in the profession simply to
make money out of the fears and credulity of the people.Doctor, the
physician of to-day is in no way qualified to handle the question of
public health--especially those doctors who say: 'If you won't take
our medicines we'll get a law passed that will make you take them.'To
place the health of the people in their hands would be a terrible
mistake.The agitation for a federal Department of Health is based
upon motives of ignorance and intentional wrong.If the people
generally knew this, they would rise in a body against it.Make what
laws you wish for yourself, Doctor.The human mind is constantly
occupied in the making of ridiculous laws and limitations.But do not
attempt to foist your laws upon the people.Tell me, why all this
agitation about teaching sex-hygiene in the public schools?Why not,
for a change, teach Christianity?But even
the Bible has been put out of the schools.By your
Church, that its interpretation may continue to be falsely made by
those utterly and woefully ignorant of its true meaning!"For some moments they continued their meal in silence.Then the girl
took up the conversation again."Doctor," she said, "will you come out
from among them and be separate?""Ah, that is the rub, then!Yes, oppose ignorance and falsity, even
though incarnate in Mr."He ruins everybody who
stands in his way!The cotton schedule has gone against him, and the
whole country will have to suffer for it!""But how can he make the country suffer because he has been blocked in
his colossal selfishness?""That I can not answer," said the doctor."But I do know that he has
intimated that there will be no cotton crop in this country next
year."Ames stands as the claim of omnipotent
evil," was his laconic reply.And when the meal was ended, the girl went her way, pondering deeply.But that was something too
dark to be reported to the Express.*       *       *       *       *

Three weeks from the day he had his brush with Carmen in the presence
of the President, Ames, the great corruptionist, the master
manipulator, again returned from a visit to Washington, and in a
dangerous frame of mind.What might have been his mental state had he
known that the train which drew his private car also brought Carmen
back to New York, can only be conjectured.It was fortunate, no doubt,
that both were kept in ignorance of that fact, and that, while the
great externalization of the human mind's "claim" of business sulked
alone in his luxurious apartments, the little follower after
righteousness sat in one of the stuffy day coaches up ahead, holding
tired, fretful babies, amusing restless children, and soothing away
the long hours to weary, care-worn mothers.When the financier's car drew into the station his valets breathed
great sighs of relief, and his French chef and <DW64> porter mopped the
perspiration from their troubled brows, while silently offering peans
of gratitude for safe delivery.When the surly giant descended the car
steps his waiting footman drew back in alarm, as he caught his
master's black looks.When he threw himself into the limousine, his
chauffeur drew a low whistle and sent a timidly significant glance in
the direction of the lackey.And when at last he flung open the doors
of his private office and loudly summoned Hood, that capable and
generally fearless individual quaked with dire foreboding."The Express--I want a libel suit brought against it at once!"Yes, sir," responded the lawyer meekly.Then, in a voice trembling with
anger: "Have you read the last week's issues?"She has no financial interest in the paper, sir.And, as for the
reports which they have published--I hardly think we can establish a
case from them--"

"What?If you and he can't make out a case
against them, then I'll get a judge and a lawyer who can!I want that
bill filed to-morrow!""Very well, sir," assented Hood, stepping back."Another thing," continued Ames, "see Judge Hanson and have the
calling of the Ketchim case held in abeyance until I am ready for it.I've got a scheme to involve that <DW64> wench in the trial, and drag
her through the gutters!So, she's still in love with Rincon, eh?Well, we'll put a crimp in that little affair, I guess!Has Willett
heard from Wenceslas?""I'll lift the scalp from that blackguard Colombian prelate if he
tries to trick me!But the detectives report that he has been in Spain
recently."he exclaimed in a voice that began
high and ended in a whisper.He lapsed into a reflective mood, and for some moments his thoughts
seemed to wander far.Then he pulled himself together and roused out
of his meditations."You told Jayne that I would back the Budget to any extent, provided
it would publish the stuff I sent it?"You and Willett set about at once getting up daily
articles attacking the Express.I want you to dig up every move ever
made by Hitt, Haynerd, that girl, Waite, Morton, and the whole
miserable, sneaking outfit!Rake up every scandal, every fact, or
rumor, that is in any way associated with any of them.I want them
literally cannonaded by the Budget!Haynerd was a bum before he got the Social Era!Waite is an unfrocked
priest!That girl--that girl is
a--Did you know that she used to be in a brothel down in the red-light
district?Great record the publishers of the Express
have, eh?I want you and Jayne to bury that whole outfit
under a mountain of mud!I'm ready to spend ten millions to do it!"I think we can do it, Mr.Now, another matter: I'm out to get the President's
scalp!Begin with those New York papers which we
can influence.I'll get Fallom and Adams over here for a conference.Meanwhile, think over what we'd better say to them.Our attacks upon
the President must begin at once!I've already bought up a Washington
daily for that purpose.They have a few facts now that will discredit
his administration!"Ah--a--there is a matter that I must mention as
soon as you are ready to hear it, Mr.It seems
that the reports which that girl has made have been translated into
several languages, and are being used by labor agitators down there to
stir up trouble.The mill hands, you know, never really understood
what your profits were, and--well, they have always been quite
ignorant, you know, regarding any details of the business.But now
they think they have been enlightened--they think they see how the
tariff has benefited you at their expense--and they are extremely
bitter against you.That priest, Father Danny, has been doing a lot of
talking since the girl was down there."cried Ames, rising from his chair, then sinking back again.Ames," the lawyer continued, "the situation is fast
becoming acute.The mill hands don't believe now that you were ever
justified in shutting down, or putting them on half time.And, whether
you reduce wages or not, they are going to make very radical demands
upon you in the near future, unless I am misinformed.These demands
include better working conditions, better tenements, shorter hours,
and very much higher wages.Also the enforcement of the child labor
law, I am sorry to say."Ames, you know you have said that it would
strengthen your case with Congress if there should be a strike at
Avon."I am
distinctly out of favor with the President--owing to that little <DW64>
wench!And Congress is going against me if I lose Gossitch, Logue, and
Mall!That girl has put me in bad down there!By G--"

"But, Mr.Ames, she can be removed, can she not?"But--if we can drive the
Express upon the shoals, and then utterly discredit that girl, either
in the libel suit or the Ketchim trial, why, then, with a little show
of bettering things at Avon, we'll get what we want.Say, is--is Sidney with the Express?"Hood started, and shot a look of mingled surprise and curiosity at his
master.Was it possible that Ames--

"You heard my question, Mr.Yes, sir--Sidney is still with them.He--a--they say
he has quite conquered his--his--"

"You mean, he's no longer a sot?"Don't sit there like a smirking Chinese god!"Ames, I learn that Sidney has been cured of his habits, and
that the--that girl--did it," stammered the nervous lawyer.Ames's mouth jerked open--and then snapped shut.His
head slowly sank until his chin touched his breast.And as he sat thus
enwrapped, Hood rose and noiselessly left the room.Alone sat the man of gold--ah, more alone than even he knew.Alone
with his bruised ambitions, his hectored egoism, his watery aims.Alone and plotting the ruin of those who had dared bid him halt in his
mad, destroying career.Alone, this high priest of the caste of
absolutism, of the old individualism which is fast hurrying into the
realm of the forgotten.Alone, and facing a new century, with whose
ideals his own were utterly, stubbornly, hopelessly discrepant.Alone he sat, looking out, unmoved, upon the want and pain of
countless multitudes gone down beneath the yoke of conditions which he
had made too hard for them.Looking, unmoved, unhearing, upon the
bitter struggles of the weak, the ignorant, the unskilled, the gross
hewers of wood and drawers of water.Looking, and knowing not that in
their piteous cry for help and light was sounded his own dire peril.The door opened, and the office boy announced the chief stenographer
of the great bank below.Ames looked up and silently nodded permission
for the man to enter.Ames," the clerk began, "I--I have come to ask a favor--a
great favor.I am having difficulty--considerable difficulty in
securing stenographers, but--I may say--my greatest struggle is
with myself.Ames, I can not--I simply can not continue to
hire stenographers at the old wage, nine dollars a week!I know how
these girls are forced to live.Ames, with prices where they
are now, they can not live on that!Say,
ten or twelve dollars to start with?""Why do you come to me with your request?""Yes, sir, I know," replied the young man with hesitation."But--I--did
speak to him about it, and--he refused.""I can do nothing, sir," returned Ames in a voice that chilled the
man's life-current.I refuse to remain here and hire
stenographers at that criminal wage!""Very well, sir," replied Ames in the same low, freezing tone.Again the guardian of the sanctity of private property was left alone.Again, as he lapsed into dark revery, his thought turned back upon
itself, and began the reconstruction of scenes and events long since
shadowy dreams.And always as they built, the fair face of that young
girl appeared in the fabric.And always as he retraced his course, her
path crossed and crossed again his own.Always as he moved, her
reflection fell upon him--not in shadow, but in a flood of light,
exposing the secret recesses of his sordid soul.He dwelt again upon the smoothness of his way in those days, before
her advent, when that group of canny pirates sat about the Beaubien's
table and laid their devious snares.It was only the summer before she
came that this same jolly company had merged their sacred trust assets
to draw the clouds which that autumn burst upon the country as the
worst financial panic it had known in years.And so shrewdly had they
planned, that the storm came unheralded from a clear sky, and at a
time when the nation was never more prosperous.They had wagered that he could not put it
through.How neatly he had turned the trick, filled his pockets, and
transformed their doubts into wondering admiration!Oh, yes, there had been some suffering, he had been told.How surprised the people of these United
States would be some day to learn that this tropic struggle was in
essence an American war!The smug and unthinkingly contented in this
great country of ours regarded the frenzied combat in the far South as
but a sort of _opera bouffe_.And he,
when that war should end, would control navigation on the great
Magdalena and Cauca rivers, and acquire a long-term lease on the
emerald mines near Bogota.Untold suffering--countless
broken hearts--indescribable, maddening torture--he had not given that
a thought.His trip to Washington had been
exhausting.His eyes had been bloodshot,
and there had been several slight hemorrhages from the nose.His
physician had shaken his head gravely, and had admonished him to be
careful--

But why did that girl continue to fascinate him?Why now,
in all his scheming and plotting, did he always see her before him?Was it only because of her rare physical beauty?If he wrote or read,
her portrait lay upon the page; if he glanced up, she stood there
facing him.There was never accusation in her look, never malice, nor
trace of hate.No; but always she
smiled--always she looked right into his eyes--always she seemed to
say, "You would destroy me, but yet I love you."Aye, much more so than he did her.She would scorn the use of his
methods.He had to admit _that_, though he hated her, detested her,
would have torn her into shreds--even while he acknowledged that he
admired her, yes, beyond all others, for her wonderful bravery and her
loyal stand for what she considered the right.He must have dozed while he sat there in the warm office alone.Surely, that hideous object now floating before his straining gaze,
that thing resembling the poor, shattered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, was not
real!It was but a shadow, a flimsy thing of thought!And that
woestricken thing there, with its tenuous arms extended toward
him--was that Gannette?But, that other shade--so like his wife, a few months dead, yet alive
again!Whence came that look of horror in a face once so haughty!It
was unreal, ghastly unreal, as it drifted past!Ah, now he knew that
he was dreaming, for there, there in the light stood Carmen!Oh, what
a blessed relief to see that fair image there among those other
ghastly sights!He would speak to her--

But--_God above_!_What was that?_ A woman--no, not Carmen--fair
and--

Her white lips moved--they were transparent--he could see right
through them--and great tears dropped from her bloodless cheeks when
her accusing look fell upon him!Slowly she floated nearer--she stopped before him, and laid a hand
upon his shoulder--it was cold, cold as ice!He tried to call out--to
rise--to break away--

And then, groaning aloud, and with his brow dripping perspiration, he
awoke.Hood entered, but stopped short when he saw his master's white face.Ames passed a hand across his wet forehead."A--a little tired, that's
all, I guess.The lawyer laid a large envelope upon the desk."There's a delegation of Avon mill hands in the outer office.Again he
seemed to see that smiling girl before him.His jaw set, and his face
drew slowly down into an expression of malignity.Then, without
examining its contents, he tore the envelope into shreds, and cast the
pieces into the waste basket."Wire Pillette at
once to discharge these fellows, and every one else concerned in the
agitation!If those rats down there want to fight, they'll find me
ready!"CHAPTER 14


The immense frame of J. Wilton Ames bent slightly, and the great legs
might have been seen to drag a bit, as the man entered his private
elevator the morning after his rejection of the mill hands' demands,
and turned the lever that caused the lift to soar lightly to his
office above.And a mouse--had the immaculate condition of his
luxurious _sanctum_ permitted such an alien dweller--could have seen
him sink heavily into his great desk chair, and lapse into deep
thought.Hood, Willett, and Hodson entered in turn; but the magnate
gave them scant consideration, and at length waved them all away, and
bent anew to his meditations.Truth to tell--though he would not have owned it--the man was now
dimly conscious of a new force at work upon him; of a change, slowly,
subtly taking place somewhere deep within.He was feebly cognizant of
emotions quite unknown; of unfamiliar sentiments, whose outlines were
but just crystallizing out from the thick magma of his materialistic
soul.And he fought them; he hated them; they made him appear unto himself
weak, even effeminate!His abhorrence of sentimentalism had been among
the strongest of his life-characteristics; and yet, though he could
not define it, a mellowing something seemed to be acting upon him that
dull, bitterly cold winter morning, that shed a soft glow throughout
his mental chambers, that seemed to touch gently the hard, rugged
things of thought that lay within, and soften away their sharp
outlines.He might not know what lay so heavily upon his thought, as
he sat there alone, with his head sunk upon his breast.And yet the
girl who haunted his dreams would have told him that it was an
interrogation, even the eternal question, "What shall it profit a
man--?"Had ever such heavenly music touched his ears before!He would have held out his arms to her if he could.And yet, how dared she come to him?How dared she, after what she had
done?To
stand within the protection which her sex afforded and vivisect anew
his tired soul?But, whatever her motives, this girl did the most
daring things he had ever seen a woman do."Isn't it funny," she said, as she stood before him with a whimsical
little smile, "that wherever I go people so seldom ask me to sit
down!"Ames sank back into his seat without speaking.Carmen stood for a
moment looking about her rich environment; then drew up a chair close
to him."You haven't the slightest idea why I have come here, have you?"she
said sweetly, looking up into his face."I must confess myself quite ignorant of the cause of this unexpected
pleasure," he returned guardedly, bending his head in mock deference,
while the great wonder retained possession of him."Well," she went on lightly, "will you believe me when I tell you that
I have come here because I love you?"So this was an attack from
a different quarter!Hitt and Haynerd had invoked her feminine wiles,
eh?With one blow the unfamiliar sentiment which had been
shedding its influence upon him that morning laid the ugly suspicion
dead at his feet.A single glance into that sweet face turned so
lovingly up to his brought his own deep curse upon himself for his
hellish thought."You know," she bubbled, with a return of her wonted airy gaiety, "I
just had to run the gauntlet through guards and clerks and office boys
to get here.Aren't you glad I didn't send in my card?For then you
would have refused to see me, wouldn't you?""If I
had known you were out there," he said more gently, "I'd have sent out
and had you dragged in.I--I have wanted something this morning; and
now I am sure it was--"

"Yes," she interrupted, taking the words out of his mouth, "you wanted
_me_.You see, it's just absolutely impossible to
oppose anybody who loves you.You know, that's the very method Jesus
gave for overcoming our enemies--to love them, just love them to
pieces, until we find that we haven't any enemies at all any more.Well, that's the way I've been doing with
you--just loving you."The man's brows knotted, and his lips tightened.Or was there aught but the deepest sincerity expressed
in the face from which he could not take his eyes?And
yet, did ever human being talk so strangely, so weirdly, as she?"I thought you looked upon me as a human monster."After all,
there was a note of pathos in the question.Carmen laid her hand upon
his."It's the _real_ you that I love," she answered gently."The monster
is only human thought--the thought that has seemed to mesmerize you.But you are going to throw off the mesmerism, aren't you?I'll help
you," she added brightly."You're going to put off the 'old man'
completely--and you're going to begin by opening yourself and letting
in a little love for those poor people down at Avon, aren't you?At the mention of the people of Avon his face became stern and dark.She had not mentioned the Beaubien,
Miss Wall, the Express, nor herself."You see, you don't understand, Mr.You'll be, oh, so surprised
some day when you learn a little about the laws of thought--even the
way human thought operates!For you can't possibly do another person
an injury without that injury flying back and striking you.You may not feel the effects of its return right
away--but it does return, and the effects accumulate.And then, some
day, when you least expect it, comes the crash!But, when you love a
person, why, that comes back to you too; and it never comes alone.It
just brings loads of good with it.Ames," she cried, suddenly rising and seizing both his hands,
"you've just _got_ to love those people down there!You can't help it,
even if you think you can, for hate is not real--it's an awful
delusion!"It was not so much an appeal which the girl made as an affirmation of
things true and yet to come.The mighty _Thou shalt not!_ which Moses
laid upon his people, when transfused by the omnipotent love of the
Christ was transformed from a clanking chain into a silken cord.The
restriction became a prophecy; for when thou hast yielded self to the
benign influence of the Christ-principle, then, indeed, thou shalt not
desire to break the law of God.Carmen returned to her chair, and sat eagerly expectant.Ames groped
within his thought for a reply.And then his mental grasp closed upon
the words of Hood."They are very bitter against me--they hate me!""They reflect in kind your thought of
them.Your boomerangs of greed, of exploitation, of utter indifference
which you have hurled at them, have returned upon you in hatred.Do
you know that hatred is a fearful poison?And do you know that
another's hatred resting upon you is deadly, unless you know how to
meet and neutralize it with love?For love is the neutralizing
alkaloid.""Love is--weakness," he said in a low tone.Why, there is no such mighty power in the whole
universe as love!"We argue from different
standpoints," he said."I am a plain, matter-of-fact, cold-blooded
business man."And that," she replied in a voice tinged with sadness, "is why
business is such chaos; why there is so much failure, so much anxiety,
fear, loss, and unhappiness in the business world.Ames, you
haven't the slightest conception of real business, have you?"Then, brightly, "I am in business,
Mr.The business of
attempting to annihilate me!""I am in the business of reflecting good to you, and to all mankind,"
she gently corrected."Then suppose you manifest your love for me by refraining from
meddling further in my affairs.Suppose from now on you let me
alone.""Why--I am not meddling with you, Mr.He opened a drawer of the desk and took out several copies of
the Express."I am to consider that this is not strictly meddling,
eh?"he continued, as he laid the papers before her."No, not at all," she promptly replied."That's uncovering evil, so's
it can be destroyed.All that evil, calling itself you and your
business, has got to come to the surface--has got to come up to the
light, so that it can be--"

"Ah!Then I, the monster, must be exposed, eh?And the mines and mills which I
own--"

"You own nothing, Mr.Ames, except by consent of the people whom you
oppress.They will wake up some day; and then state and national
ownership of public utilities will come, forced by such as you.""And that desideratum will result in making everybody honest, I
suppose?"All our
present troubles, whether domestic, business, civic, or social, come
from a total misapprehension of the nature of God--a misunderstanding
of what is really _good_.We have _all_ got to prove Him.And we are
very foolish to lose any more time setting about it, don't you think
so?"You see," she went on, while he sat studying her, "those poor people
down at Avon don't know any more about what is the real good than you
do.And that's why their thoughts and yours center upon the false
pleasures of this ephemeral existence called life--this existence of
the so-called physical senses--and why you both become the tools of
vice, disease, and misfortune.They build up such men as you, and then
you turn about and crush them.And in the end you are both what the
Bible says--poor, deluded fools.""Well, I'll be--"

"Oh, don't swear!"she pleaded, again seizing his hand and laughing up
into his face."It's time you started to prove God," she said earnestly."Won't you
begin now--to-day?Haven't you yet learned that evil is the very
stupidest, dullest, most uninteresting thing in the world?Won't you turn from your material endeavors now, and take time
to learn to really live?You've got plenty of time, you know, for you
aren't obliged to work for a living."She was leaning close to him, and her breath touched his cheek.Her
soft little hand lay upon his own.And her great, dark eyes looked
into his with a light which he knew, despite his perverted thought,
came from the unquenchable flame of her selfless love.Again that unfamiliar sentiment--nay, rather, that sentiment long
dormant--stirred within him.Again his worldly concepts, long
entrenched, instantly rose to meet and overthrow it.He had not yet
learned to analyze the thoughts which crept so silently into his
ever-open mentality.And to those
which savored of things earthy he still gave the power to build, with
himself as a willing tool."You will--help me--to live?"He thought her the most
gloriously beautiful object he had ever known, as she sat there before
him, so simply gowned, and yet clothed with that which all the gold of
Ophir could not have bought."Yes, gladly--oh, so gladly!"Her eyes sparkled with a rush of tears."Don't you think," he said gently, drawing his chair a little closer
to her, "that we have quite misunderstood each other?"But," with a happy smile
again lighting her features, "we can understand each other now, can't
we?"And hasn't the time come for us to work together,
instead of continuing to oppose each other?""I--I have been thinking so ever since I returned yesterday from
Washington.I am--I--"

"We need each other, don't we?"the artless girl exclaimed, as she
beamed upon him."I can help
you--more than you realize--and I want to.I--I've been sorry for you,
little girl, mighty sorry, ever since that story got abroad about--"

"Oh, never mind that!""We are living in the
present, you know."And I
want to see them straightened out.And you and I can do it, little
one.Madam Beaubien hasn't been treated right, either."We're going to
forget that in the good we're going to do, aren't we?"And you are going to get a square deal.Now, I've got
a plan to make everything right.I want to see you in the place that
belongs to you.I want to see you happy, and surrounded by all that is
rightfully yours.And if you will join me, we will bring that all
about.I told you this once before, you may remember."He stopped and awaited the effect of his words upon the girl.Ames," she replied, her eyes shining with a great hope,
"don't think about me!It's the people at Avon that I want to help.""We'll help them, you and I. We'll make things right all round.And
Madam Beaubien shall have no further trouble."Sidney shall come home--"

With a rush the impulsive girl, forgetting all but the apparent
success of her mission, threw herself upon him and clasped her arms
about his neck."Oh," she cried, "it is love that has done all this!The startled man strained the girl tightly in his arms.He could feel
the quick throbbing in her throat.Her warm breath played upon his
cheek like fitful tropic breezes.For a brief moment the supreme gift
of the universe seemed to be laid at his feet.For a fleeting interval
the man of dust faded, and a new being, pure and white, seemed to rise
within him."Yes," he murmured gently, "we'll take him to our home with us."Slowly, very slowly, the girl released herself from his embrace and
stepped back.she murmured, searching his face for the
meaning which she had dimly discerned in his words.He reached forward and with a quick movement seized her
hand.Not now--no, you
needn't come to me until you are ready.Why, I didn't know until to-day what it was that was making
me over!Don't--"

Carmen had struggled away from him, and, with a look of bewilderment
upon her face, was moving toward the door."Oh, I didn't know," she
murmured, "that you were--were--proposing _marriage_ to me!"We'll begin all over again, you and I!Why, I'll do anything--anything
in the world you say, Carmen, if you will come to me--if you will be
my little wife!"I know--I know," he hastily resumed, as she halted and stood
seemingly rooted to the floor, "there is a great difference in our
ages.But that is nothing--many happy marriages are made between ages
just as far apart as ours.I'll make Madam Beaubien rich!I'll support the
Express, and make it what you want it to be!I'll do whatever you say
for the people of Avon!Think, little girl, what depends now upon
you!"Carmen turned and came slowly back to him."And--you will not do these
things--unless I marry you?"she said in a voice scarcely above a
whisper."I will do them all, Carmen, if you will come to me!""But--oh, you were only deceiving me all the time!And now--if I
refuse--then what?""It depends upon you, entirely--and you will come?Not now--but within
the next few months--within the year--tell me that you will!""But--you will do these things whether I come to you or not?""I've put it all into your hands," he answered shortly.Then
she glanced about in helpless bewilderment."I--I--love--you," she murmured, as she looked off toward the window,
but with unseeing eyes."I would do anything for you that was right.I--love--everybody--everybody; but there are no conditions to _my_
love.she suddenly cried, burying her face in her hands and
bursting into tears."You have tried to _buy_ me!"Taking her by the hand he led her,
unresisting, back to her chair."Listen," he said, bending toward her."Go home now and think it
all over.It was sudden, I admit; I
took you by surprise.But--well, you are not going to prevent the
accomplishment of all that good, are you?She had been crushed; and
another lesson in the cruelty of the human mind--that human mind which
has changed not in a thousand years--had been read to her.But again
she smiled bravely, as she wiped her eyes."It's all right now," she murmured."It was all right all the
time--and I was protected.""Some day," she said gently, and in a voice
that trembled just a little, "you will help the people of Avon, but
not because I shall marry you."Then you refuse my offer, do you?""Remember, all the blame will be upon you.She saw now with a clairvoyance which separated
him from the mask which he had worn.Her glance penetrated until it
found his soul."You have shown me the depths of the carnal mind," she slowly replied."The responsibility is not with me, but with--God.I--I came to-day
to--to help you.But now I must leave you--with Him."He stooped and took up her muff which lay upon the floor.As he did so,
a letter fell out.He seized it and glanced at the superscription.Another little _billet-doux_ to your
priestly lover, eh?"She looked down at the letter which he held."It is money," she said,
though her thought seemed far away."Money that I am sending to a
little newsboy who bears his name."He rose and opened a drawer in his desk.Taking out a paper-bound
book, he held it out to the girl."Here's a
little piece of work which your brilliant lover did some time ago.Do you know the penalty your
clerical paramour paid for that, eh?Then I'll tell you," bending over
close to her ear, "his _life_!"She staggered
a few steps toward the door, then stopped."God--is--is--_everywhere_!"Then she reeled, and fell heavily to the floor.CHAPTER 15


If additional proof of the awful cost of hating one's fellow-men were
required, the strike which burst upon the industrial world that winter
must furnish it in sickening excess.But other facts, too, were
rendered glaringly patent by that same desperate clash which made Avon
a shambles and transformed its fair name into a by-word, to be spoken
only in hushed whispers when one's thought dwells for a moment upon
the madness of the carnal mind that has once tasted blood.The
man-cleft chasm between labor and capital, that still unbridged void
which separates master and servant, and which a money-drunk class
insolently calls God-made, grows wider with each roar of musketry
aimed by a frenzied militia at helpless men and women; grows deeper
with each splitting crack of the dynamite that is laid to tear asunder
the conscienceless wielder of the goad; and must one day fall gaping
in a cavernous embouchure that will engulf a nation.Hitt saw it, and shuddered; Haynerd, too.Ames may have dimly marked
the typhoon on the horizon, but, like everything that manifested
opposition to this superhuman will, it only set his teeth the firmer
and thickened the callous about his cold heart.And she knew--and the world must some day know--that but one tie has
ever been designed adequate to bridge this yawning canon of human
hatred.Aye, well she knew that the world laughed,
and called it chimera; called it idealism, and emotional weakness.And well she knew that the most pitiable weakness the world has ever
seen was the class privilege which nailed the bearer of the creed of
love upon the cross, and to-day manifests in the frantic grasping of a
nation's resources, and the ruthless murder of those who ask that
they, too, may have a share in that abundance which is the common
birthright of all.Do the political bully, the grafter, the tout, know
the meaning of love?Oh, not by the
hypocritical millionaire pietists who prate their glib platitudes to
their Sunday Bible classes, and return to their luxurious homes to
order the slaughter of starving women and babes!They, like their poor
victims, are deep under the spell of that mesmerism which tells them
that evil is good.Nor by the Church, with its lamentable weakness of
knowledge and works.Only by those who have learned something of the
Christ-principle, and are striving daily to demonstrate its
omnipotence in part, can the world be taught a saving knowledge of the
love that solves every problem and creates a new heaven and a newer,
better concept of the earth and its fullness.That morning when Carmen went to see Ames the Express received word of
the walk-out of the Avon mill employes.Almost coincident with the
arrival of the news, Carmen herself came unsteadily into Hitt's
office.The editor glanced up at her, then looked a second time.He
had never before seen her face colorless."What work have you--for me--to-day?"Then, so low that he scarcely caught the
words, "I--I have been with--a friend."Sidney Ames came puffing into the office at that moment."How does it happen you're out riding with
Willett?Saw him help you out of an auto just now.""He brought me here," she answered softly.Hitt and the lad stared at her with open mouths.She turned, and
started for her own room, moving as if in a haze.As she neared the
door she stumbled.Sidney sprang after her and caught her in his arms.When she turned her face, they saw that her eyes were swimming in
tears.Hitt closed the door after him, then took
the girl's hand and led her back to his own chair."Now, little one,"
he said gently, "tell me all about it."Then the tears began to flow; and then she
leaned her head against him and sobbed--sobbed as does the stricken
mother who hangs over the lifeless form of her babe--sobbed as does
the strong man bereft of the friend of his bosom--sobbed as did the
Man of Sorrow, when he held out his arms over the worldly city that
cruelly rejected him.He was the channel for the divine; yet the
wickedness of the human mind broke his great heart.Carmen was not far
from him at that moment.Hitt held her hand, and choked back the lump that filled his throat.Then the weeping slowly ceased, and the girl looked up into his
anxious face."It's all past now," she said brokenly."Jesus forgave them that
killed him.And--"

"You have been with--Ames?"said Hitt in a low, quiet tone."And he
tried to kill you?""He--he knew not what he was doing.Evil used him, because as
yet he has no spiritual understanding."Well, little girl, I am waiting for the whole story.It
didn't happen--it wasn't real.I--I seemed to manifest weakness--and I
fell--to the floor--but I didn't lose consciousness."But what had Ames said to you, Carmen?"persisted Hitt, his face dark
with anger.Ames only as--as God's child," she
murmured."Evil is not real, and it doesn't happen.Now I want to
work--work as I never did before!_I must!_"

"Will you not tell me more about it?"he asked, for he knew now that a
deadly thrust had been made at the girl's life."It didn't happen," was her
reply.A suspicion flashed into Hitt's mind, kindled by the girl's insistence
upon the nothingness of death."Carmen," he asked, "did he tell you
that--some one had died?"She came to him and laid her head against him.I shall overcome it, for God is with me.Promise that no
one but us shall know!The man's eyes grew moist, and his throat filled.He drew the girl to
him and kissed her forehead."It shall be as you wish, little one," he
said in a choking voice.This is another
opportunity to--to prove God!He turned to his desk with a heavy heart."There is work to be done
now," he said."I wonder--"

She took the telegram from his hands and scanned it.At once she
became calm, her own sorrow swallowed up in selfless love."Oh, they
have gone out at Avon!Hitt, I must go there at once!""I thought so," he replied, swallowing hard.But you are in higher hands than mine, Carmen.And we, Sidney and I, will
say nothing of--of your visit to his father."*       *       *       *       *

That night Hitt called up the Beaubien and asked if he and Haynerd
might come and talk with her after the paper had gone to press, and
requesting that she notify Carmen and Father Waite.A few hours later
the little group met quietly in the humble cottage.Miss Wall and
Sidney were with them.And to them all those first dark hours of
morning, when as yet the symbol of God's omnipresence hung far below
the horizon, seemed prescient with a knowledge of evil's further
claims to the lives and fortunes of men."I have asked you here," Hitt gravely announced when they were
assembled, "to consider a matter which touches us all--how deeply, God
alone knows.At ten o'clock to-night I received this message."He
opened the paper which he held in his hand and read:

  "'Property of Hitt oil company, including derricks, pump houses,
  storage tanks, destroyed by fire.Dynamite in pump houses
  exploded, causing wells to cave and choke.The news burst over them like the cracking of a bomb.Haynerd, who,
like the others, had been kept in ignorance of the message until now,
started from his chair with a loud exclamation, then sank back limp.Evil seemed to have chosen that day with
canny shrewdness to overwhelm her with its quick sallies from out the
darkness of the carnal mind."I see in this," he said slowly, "the
culmination of a long series of efforts to ruin the Express.That my
oil property was deliberately wrecked, I have not the slightest doubt.demanded Haynerd, having again found his voice."The Express has stood before the world as a
paper unique and apart.And because of its high ideals, the forces of
evil singled it out at the beginning for their murderous assaults.That the press of this country is very generally muzzled, stifled,
bought and paid for, I have good reason now to know.My constant
brushes with the liquor interests, with low politicians, judges,
senators, and dive-keepers, have not been revealed even to you.Could
you know the pressure which the Church, both Catholic and Protestant,
has tried to exert upon us, you would scarce credit me with veracity.But the Express has stood out firm against feudalism, mediaevalism,
and entrenched ecclesiasticism.It has fearlessly opposed the
legalizing of drugging.It has fought the debauching of a nation's
manhood by the legalized sale of a deadly poison, alcohol.And it has
fought without quarter the pernicious activity of morally stunted
brewers and distillers, whose hellish motto is, 'Make the boys drink!'It has fought the money octopus, and again and again has sounded to
the world the peril which money-drunken criminals like Ames and his
clique constitute.And for that we must now wear the crown of
martyrdom!"Silence, dismal and empty, lay over the little room for a long time."The Express has not been self-supporting.Its
growth has been steady, but it has depended for its deficit upon the
revenue from my oil property.Ames ruined Madam
Beaubien financially, as well as Miss Wall.And now, knowing that we all depended upon my oil wells, he has, I
doubt not, completely removed that source of income.""But," exclaimed Haynerd, "your property was insured, wasn't it?""Yes," replied Hitt, with a feeble attempt at a smile."But with the
proviso that dynamite should not be kept on the premises.You will
note that dynamite wrecked the wells.That doubtless renders my
policies void.But, even in case I should have a fighting chance with
the insurance companies, don't you think that they will be advised
that I purposely set fire to the wells, in order to collect the
insurance?And I shall find myself with a big
lawsuit on my hands, and with no funds to conduct the fight.Ames's
work, you know, is always thorough, and the Express is already facing
his suit for libel.""But you told us you were going to mortgage your property," said Miss
Wall."I stood ready to, should the Express require it.But, with its recent
little boom, our paper did not seem to need that as yet," he
returned."Yes, Ned, God _is_ good!""Can you say that, after all you have
endured, Carmen?"He looked at her for a moment, lost in wonder."An outcast babe," he
murmured, "left on the banks of a great river far, far away; reared
without knowledge of father or mother, and amid perils that hourly
threatened to crush her; torn from her beloved ones and thrust out
into an unknown and unsympathetic world; used as a stepping-stone to
advance the low social ambitions of worldly women; blackened by the
foulest slander, and ejected as an outcast by those who had fawned at
her feet; still going about with her beautiful message of love, even
though knowing that her childhood home is enveloped in the flames of
war, and her dear ones scattered, perhaps lost; spurned from the door
of the rich man whom she sought to save; carrying with her always the
knowledge that the one upon whom her affections had centered had a son
in distant Cartagena, and yet herself contributing to the support of
the little lad; and now, this morning--" He stopped, for he remembered
his promise."This morning," she finished, "shielded by the One who is both Father
and Mother to me.""That One surely ought to love you, Carmen--"

"He does," she answered softly.put in Haynerd, torn with anger and fear."What are we going
to do now?""Everything, Ned, that error seems to tell us not to do," replied the
girl.She reached over to the little table that stood near, and took from it
a Bible.Opening it, she read aloud, very slowly, the entire
fourteenth chapter of Exodus.Then she concluded by reading the last
two verses of the eighth chapter of Romans."Now," she said, looking up, "we know what we are going to do, don't
we?We are going right on, as'seeing Him who is invisible' to men
like Mr."There is no curse, whether of the Church, or of business, or of any
department of human thought, that can overthrow legitimate business;
and we are in the legitimate business of reflecting God to the world.If the physical sense of supply is now lost, we are fortunate, for now
we are obliged to acquire a higher sense.And we become aware of it in our own consciousness.It is there
that we interpret His supply.Ames interprets it one way; we, in a
very different way.God has always been able to prepare a table in the
wilderness of human thought.If we look for supply from without, we
shall not find it, for everything is within.And the very fact that
there is a legitimate demand shows that there is the supply to meet
it, for--though the world hasn't learned this yet--_it is the supply
itself that really creates the demand_!""Money, Ned, is the counterfeit of God.He is
our Principle--infinite, inexhaustible.We are facing a crisis, but, like every seeming disturbance of
the infinite harmony, it will vanish in a little while if we but cling
to the divine Mind that is God for guidance."Hitt folded the telegram and returned it to his pocket."Are you going
to Avon to-morrow?""And when we have in our midst this girl, who has borne,
without one word of complaint or reviling, the world's most poignant
sorrows!I--I really regret that I told you of--of this telegram.I
seemed for a moment to be overwhelmed.But I am on my feet again
now!"He reached into a pocket and took out some bills, which he handed to
Carmen."That will see you through for a day or so down there.Come," he added,
beckoning to Haynerd, "the Express will be issued to-morrow as usual,
and we must get to bed.I've really had quite a strenuous day!"He
turned, then paused and looked at Carmen.The girl caught the meaning in his glance, and went directly to the
piano."Don't," he said, "if you do not feel like it.This day has been a
hard one for you, I know.And--"

"But I do feel like it," she answered, smiling up at him.And," her voice dropped low, "I want to sing to--Him."Hitt gulped down something in his throat."The bravest little girl in
the whole wide world!"*       *       *       *       *

The carnage at Avon was not incidental; it was the logical effect of
definite mental causes.It was the orderly sequence of an endless
train of hatred of man for man, bred of greed and the fear of
starvation.And starvation is the externalized human belief that life
is at the caprice of intelligent matter.But that is an infraction of
the first Commandment, given when the human race was a babe.When the mill hands left their looms at evening of the day following
Ames's rejection of their demands, the master closed the doors behind
them and locked them out.The parrot-cry of the maudlin sentimental!But, four thousand men, women, and little children, with never a
dollar beyond their earnings of the day, thrust out into the blasts of
the bitterest winter the New England states had known in years!True; but why, then, did they strike?For, you see, that of itself
proved the soundness of Ames's single reply to all further appeal:
"There is nothing whatever to arbitrate."In the garden of the human mind waves many a flower, both black and
red, fanned by the foul winds of carnal thought.There grow the
brothel, the dive, the gin-shop, the jail.About these hardier stems
twine the hospital, the cemetery, the madhouse, the morgue.And Satan,
"the man-killer from the beginning," waters their roots and makes
fallow the soil with the blood of fools.But of those for whom the
gardener waits, there is none whose blood is so life-giving to these
noxious plants as that type of the materially rich who, like Ames,
have waxed gross upon the flesh of their own brothers.Ames was a gambler in human lives.They were his chips, by which he
gained or lost, and of themselves were void of intrinsic value.The
world was the table whereon he played; the game _rouge et noir_, with
the whirl of predatory commercialism as the wheel, and the ball
weighted to drop where he might direct.He carried millions on margin,
and with them carried the destinies, for weal or for woe, of millions
of his fellow-men, with not one thought that he did so at the cost of
their honor and morality, not less than their life-blood.It had been his custom to close his mills for several months each
year, in order to save expense when times were dull.And he did this
as casually as he closed the doors of his stables, and with much less
thought for the welfare of those concerned.It is doubtful if he had
ever really considered the fact that these four thousand human beings
were wholly dependent upon him for their very existence.For he was a
business man, and gold was far weightier in the scale of values than
human flesh, and much less easily obtained.Cain's comforting
philosophy was quite correct, else would the business world not have
been so firmly established upon it.Besides, he was terribly busy; and
his life was lived upon a plane high, high above that upon which these
swarming toilers groveled with their snouts in the dust.And now, with the doors of his mills barred against the hungry hordes,
he would frame the terms upon which they should be reopened.The
eight-hour law must not be enforced.Perhaps he could influence the
Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, as depriving the mill
hands of the right to labor as long as they pleased.And the right to organize and band together for their
common good would be contemptuously denied the ignorant rats who
should be permitted to toil for him once more.If they offered
violence, there was the state militia, armed and impatient to slay.Also, this was an excellent opportunity to stamp out trade-unionism
within the confines of his activities.He would win the plaudits of
the whole industrial world by so doing.He therefore immediately got
in touch with the Governor, a Tammany puppet, and received that loyal
henchman's warm assurances of hearty support for any measures which
the great magnate might wish to enforce.He then approached the
officers of the state guard, and secured them to a man.Times were
hard, and they welcomed his favor.He finally posted armed guards in
all his buildings at Avon, and bade them remember that property rights
were of divine institution.Then he sat down and dictated the general
policy to be followed by the Amalgamated Spinners' Association
throughout the country in support of his own selfish ends.His activity in these preparations, as in everything, was tremendous.His agents swarmed over the state like ants.The Catholic Archbishop
was instructed that he must remove Father Danny from Avon, as his
influence was pernicious.But the objection was made that the priest
was engaged only in humanitarian labors.It availed not; Ames desired
the man's removal.The widow Marcus likewise had
been doing much talking.Ames's lawyer, Collins, had her haled into
court and thoroughly reprimanded.And then, that matters might be
precipitated, and Congress duly impressed with the necessity of
altering the cotton schedule in favor of the Spinners' Association,
Ames ordered his agents to raise the rents of his miserable Avon
tenements.There were few, he knew, who dared even attempt to meet the
raise; and those who could not, he ordered set into the streets.It was a wild winter's day that the magnate chose for the enforcement
of this cruel order.A driving blizzard had raged throughout the
night, and the snow had banked up in drifts in places many feet deep.The temperature was freezing, and the strong east wind cut like a
knife.It was Ames's desire to teach these scum a needed lesson, and
he had chosen to enlist the elements to aid him in the righteous
task.For a week, ever since the strike was declared, Carmen had lived among
these hectored people.Daily her reports of the unbearable situation
had gone to Hitt.And through them the editor had daily striven to
awaken a nation's conscience.Ames read the articles, and through the
columns of the Budget sought to modify them to the extent of shifting
the responsibility to the shoulders of the mill hands themselves, and
to a dilatory Congress that was criminally negligent in so framing a
cotton tariff as to make such industrial suffering possible.Nor did
he omit to foully vilify the Express and calumniate its personnel.Amid curses, screams, and despairing wails, the satanic work of
ejecting the tenement dwellers went on that day.Ames's hirelings,
with loaded rifles, assisted the constables and city police in the
miserable work, themselves cursing often because of the keen blasts
that nipped their ears and numbed their well-cased limbs.More than
one tiny, wailing babe was frozen at the breast that dull, drab
afternoon, when the sun hung like a ghastly clot of human blood just
above the horizon, and its weird, yellow light flitted through the
snow-laden streets like gaunt spectres of death.More than one aged,
toil-spent laborer, broken at the loom in the service of his
insatiable master, fell prone in the drifts and lay there till his
thin life-current froze and his tired heart stopped.More than one
frenzied, despairing father, forgetful for the moment of the divine
right of property, rushed at a guard and madly strove with him, only
to be clubbed into complaisance, or, perchance, be left in a welter of
crimson on the drifting snow.She had been to see
Pillette that same morning, and had been laughed from his presence.She did not understand, she was told, what miserable creatures these
were that dared ask for bread and human rights.Wait; they themselves
would show their true colors.And it spurted like fountains
from their veins.And they saw it with dimming eyes, and were glad,
for it brought sweet oblivion.That night there were great fires
built along the frozen creek.Shacks and tents were hastily reared;
and the shivering, trembling women and babes given a desperate
shelter.Then the men, sullen and grim, drew off into little groups,
and into the saloons and gambling halls of the town.And when the
blizzard was spent, and the cold stars were dropping their frozen
light, these dull-witted things began to move, slowly at first,
circling about like a great forming nebula, but gaining momentum and
power with each revolution.More than a thousand strong, they circled
out into the frozen streets of the little town, and up along the main
thoroughfare.Their low
curses welled into a roar.And then, like the sudden bursting of
pent-up lava, they swept madly through the town, carrying everything
to destruction before them.Stores, shops, the bank itself, burst open before this wave of
maddened humanity.Guns and pistols were thrown from laden shelves to
the cursing, sweating mob below.Axes and knives were gathered by
armfuls, and borne out into the streets to the whirling mass.Great
barrels of liquor were rolled into the gutters and burst asunder.Bread and meat were dragged from the shops and savagely devoured.The
police gathered and planted themselves with spitting pistols before
the human surge.They went down like grass under stampeded cattle.Frightened clerks and operators rushed to the wires and sent wild,
incoherent appeals for help to New York.Pandemonium had the reins,
the carnal mind was unleashed.On rolled the mob, straight on to the massive stone house of Pillette,
the resident manager of the great Ames mills.On over the high iron
fence, like hungry dock rats.On up the
broad drive, shouting, shooting, moaning, raving.On over the veranda,
and in through broken windows and shattered doors, swarming like flies
over reeking carrion, until the flames which burst through the peaked
roof of the mansion drove them forth, and made them draw sullenly,
protestingly away, leaving the tattered bodies of Pillette and his
wife and daughters to be consumed in the roaring furnace.Oh, ye workers, ye toilers at loom and forge, it is indeed you who
bear the world's burdens!It is you who create the rich man's wealth,
and fight his battles.So ye fought in the great war between North and
South, and protected the rich man at home, hovering in fright over his
money bags.It is you who put into his hands the bayonet which he
turns against you to guard his wealth and maintain his iniquitous
privilege.It is indeed in your hands that the destinies of this great
nation lie; but what will ye do with your marvelous opportunity?What, with your stupendous, untried strength?Will ye once more set up
the golden calf, and prostrate yourselves before it?Will ye again
enthrone ecclesiastical despotism, and grovel before image of Virgin
and Saint?Will ye raise high the powers of mediaeval darkness, and
bend your necks anew to the yoke of ignorance and stagnation?But
think you now that flames and dynamite will break your present bonds?Aye, America may be made a land without a pauper, without a
millionaire, without industrial strife.But fire and sword will not
effect the transformation.Yes, perhaps, as has been said, our
"comfortable social system and its authority will some day be blown to
atoms."But shall we then be better off than we are to-day?For shall
we know then how to use our precious liberty?Blood-drunk and reeling, the mob turned from the flaming wreckage and
flowed down toward the mills.There were some among them, saner, and
prescient of the dire consequences of their awful work, who counseled
restraint.Down into the creek
bottom rolled the seething tide, with a momentum that carried it up
the far side and crashing into the heavily barred oak doors of the
great mills.A crushing hail of bullets fell upon them, and their
leaders went down; but the mass wavered not.Those within the
buildings knew that they would become carrion in the maws of the
ravening wolves outside, and fought with a courage fed with
desperation.In the solemn hush of death Socrates said, "The hour of departure has
arrived, and we go our ways, I to die and you to live.And mankind through the ages in their last
hours have echoed this sentiment of the gentle philosopher.For all
human philosophy leads to a single end--resignation.The frenzied hordes swarming about the Ames mills knew in their heart
of hearts that death was preferable to life in death under the goad of
human exploitation.In the distance, across the swale, the sky glowed red where the souls
of the agent of predatory wealth and his family had gone out in
withering heat.In the stricken town, men huddled their trembling
loved ones about them and stood with loaded muskets.Somewhere on the
steel bands that linked this scene of carnage with the great
metropolis beyond, a train plunged and roared, leaping over the
quivering rails at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, bringing eager
militiamen and their deadly instruments of civilization.For the Ames
mills were private property.*       *       *       *       *

In his luxurious office in the tower of the Ames building the master
sat that black night, surrounded by his laboring cohorts.Though they
strained under the excitement of the hour, Ames himself remained calm
and determined.He was in constant communication with the Governor at
Albany, and with the municipal officers of both New York and Avon.He
had received the tidings of the destruction of the Pillette family
with a grim smile.But the smile had crystallized into an expression
of black, malignant hatred when he demanded of the Governor that the
New York contingent of the state guard be sent at once to protect his
property, and specified that the bullets used should be of the
"dum-dum" variety.Such
bullets had been prohibited by the rules of modern warfare, it was
true.And Ames, foreseeing it all, had
purchased a hundred thousand rounds of these hellish things for the
militia to exchange for those which the Government furnished.And
then, as an additional measure of precaution, he had sent Hood and
Collins into the United States District Court and persuaded the
sitting judge to issue an injunction, enjoining any possible relief
committees from furnishing food and shelter to such as might enter the
industrial conflict being waged against him.And in the blood-red haze that hung
before his glittering eyes was framed the face of the girl who had
spurned him but a few days before.She was the embodiment of love that
had crossed his path and stirred up the very quintessence of evil
within him.From the first she had
aroused within his soul a conflict of emotions such as he had never
known before.And from the night when, in the Hawley-Crowles box at
the opera he had held her hand and looked down into her fathomless
eyes, he had been tortured with the conflicting desires to possess
that fair creature, or to utterly destroy her.Always she hovered just within his
grasp; and then drew back as his itching fingers closed.Always she
told him she loved him--and he knew she lied not.And such love had
its price--but not hers.And so hope strove with wrath, and chagrin
with despair.And
with it she had laid the giant low and bound him with chains.Though he knew now that she was lost to him forever; though
with foul curses he had seen hope flee; yet with it he had also bidden
every tender sentiment, every last vestige of good depart from his
thought forever more.And:

              "----with hope, farewell fear,
              Farewell remorse: all good to me is lost;
              Evil, be thou my good!"And that night the master slept
not, but sat alone at his desk in the great Fifth Avenue mansion, and
plotted the annihilation of every human being who had dared oppose his
worldly ambitions.Plotted, too, the further degradation and final
ruin of the girl who had dared to say she loved him, and yet would not
become his toy.*       *       *       *       *

There is no need to curse the iniquitous industrial and social system
upon which the unstable fabric of our civilization rests, for that
system is its own fell curse in the rotting fruit it bears.A bit of
that poisonous fruit had now dropped from the slimy branch at Avon.Up
from the yards came the militiamen at double-quick, with rifles
unslung and loaded with the satanic Ames bullets.Behind them they
dragged two machine guns, capable of discharging three hundred times a
minute.The mob had concentrated upon the central building of the mill
group, and had just gained entrance through its shattered doors.Before them the guards were falling slowly back, fighting every inch
of the way.The air was thick with powder
smoke.The roar of battle was
deafening.Quickly swinging into action, the militia opened upon the mill hands.Hemmed in between two fires, the mob broke and fled down the frozen
stream.The officers of the guard then ordered their men to join in
the work of extinguishing the flames, which were beginning to make
headway, fanned by the strong draft which swept through the long
building.Then, the building
saved, they pitched their tents and sought a brief rest.At noon the soldiers were again assembled, for there remained the task
of arresting the leaders of the mob and bringing them to justice.The
town had been placed under martial law with the arrival of the
militia.Its streets were patrolled by armed guards, and a strong
cordon had been thrown around the shacks which the mill hands had
hastily erected the afternoon before.And now, under the protection of
a detachment of soldiers, the demand was made for the unconditional
surrender of the striking laborers.Dull terror lay like a pall over the miserable shacks huddled along
the dead stream.It was the dull, hopeless, numbing terror of the
victim who awaits the blow from the lion's paw in the arena.Weeping
wives and mothers, clasping their little ones to them, knelt upon the
frozen ground and crossed themselves.Young men drew their newly-wed
mates to their breasts and kissed them with trembling lips.Stern,
hard-faced men, with great, knotted hands, grouped together and looked
out in deadly hatred at the heartless force surrounding them.Then out from among them and across the ice went Carmen, up the
slippery hillside, and straight to the multi-mouthed machine gun, at
the side of which stood Major Camp.She had been all night with these
bewildered, maddened people.She had warmed shivering babes at her own
breast.She had comforted widows of a night, and newly-bereaved
mothers.She had bound up gaping wounds, and had whispered tender
words of counsel and advice.And they had clung to her weeping; they
had called upon Virgin and Saint to bless her; and they named her the
Angel of Avon--and the name would leave her no more."Take me," she said, "take me into court, and let me tell all."This beautiful, well-clad girl among
such miserable vermin!"You have demanded their leaders," she continued."I have been trying
to lead them.The major's eyes roved over her face and figure.He could make nothing
out of her words, but he motioned to an aid, and bade him place the
girl under arrest.A wild shout then rose from the shacks, as Carmen moved quietly away
under guard.A dozen men sprang out and rushed, muskets in
hand, up toward the soldiers to liberate her.Their narrow vision could
comprehend but one thing at a time; and they saw in the arrest of the
girl only an additional insult piled upon their already mountainous
injuries.It was answered by a shriek of rage from the hovels, and a murderous
return fire.Then the major gave another loud command, and the machine
guns began to vomit forth their clattering message of death.At the sound of shooting, Carmen's guard halted.Then one of them
fell, pierced by a bullet from the strikers.The others released the
girl, and hurried back to the battle line.Carmen stood alone for a
moment.One sang its death-song almost in her ear.Then she turned and made her way slowly up the hill to the
paralyzed town.Down in the vale beneath, Death swung his scythe with long, sweeping
strokes.The two machine guns poured a flaming sheet of lead into the
little camp below.The tents
caught fire, and were whirled blazing aloft by the brisk wind.Men
dropped like chaff from a mill.Hysterical, screaming women rushed
hither and yon to save their young, and were torn to shreds by the
merciless fusillade from above.Babes stood for a moment bewildered,
and then sank with great, gaping wounds in their little, quivering
bodies.And over all brooded the spirit of the great manipulator,
Ames, for the protection of whose sacred rights such ghastly work is
done among civilized men to-day.*       *       *       *       *

That night, while the stars above Avon drew a veil of gray between
them and the earth below, that they might not see the red embers and
stark bodies, Carmen came slowly, and with bent head, into the office
of the Express.As she approached Hitt's door she heard him in earnest
conversation with Haynerd."Yes," the editor was saying, "I had a mortgage placed on the Express
to-day, but I couldn't get much.And it's a short-term one, at that.Stolz refused point blank to help us, unless we would let him dictate
the policy of the paper.He's still
fighting Ames for control of C. and R. And I learn, too, that the
Ketchim case is called for next week.That probably means an attempt
by Ames to smoke Stolz out through Ketchim.It also means that
Carmen--"

"Yes; what about her?""That she will be forced to go upon the stand as a witness.""And that, as I read it, means a further effort on Ames's part to
utterly discredit her in the eyes of the world, and us through her
association with the Express.""But--where is she, Hitt?No word from her since we got the news of
the massacre at Avon this afternoon!Nothing happened to her, do you
think?"Hitt's face was serious, and he did not answer.Then Carmen herself
came through the open door.Both men rose with exclamations of
gladness to welcome her.The girl's eyes were wet, and her wonted
smile had gone.Hitt," she said, "I want a thousand dollars to-night."Hitt and Haynerd both sat down hard."I must go back to Avon to-morrow," she announced."And the money is
for the--the people down there."Her voice caught, and her words
stumbled.The two men looked at each other blankly.Then Hitt reached out and
took her hand."Tell us," he said, "about the trouble there to-day.""No," she said, "we will not talk about evil.A thousand--"

"I have that much on deposit in the bank now, Carmen," he replied
gravely.His thought was on the mortgage which he had signed that
morning."Then write me a check at once, and I will deposit it in the Avon bank
when I get there to-morrow.I must go home now--to see mother.""But--let me think about it, Carmen.Money is--well, won't less than
that amount do you?"Hitt sighed, but made no further protest.If the Express must founder,
then this money were well spent on the stricken people of Avon.He
took out his book, and immediately wrote the check and handed it to
the girl."Hitt," said Haynerd, after Carmen had left them and he had exhausted
his protests over the size of the check, "something's killing that
girl!And it isn't only the trouble at Avon, either!"She's no longer in this world, Ned.But Hitt would say nothing to further illuminate his cryptic remark,
and Haynerd soon switched to the grim topic of the industrial war in
progress at Avon.A
social and industrial system such as ours, which leaves the masses to
starve and consume with disease under intolerable burdens, that a
handful may rot in idleness and luxury, marks us in this latest
century as hopelessly insane!""Well, Ned, whence came the idea, think you, that it is divine justice
for a majority of the people on earth to be poor in order that a few
may be rich?And how are we going to get that perverted idea out of
the minds of men?"Legislation arouses no faith in me!We are
suffering here because, in our immensely selfish thought of ourselves
only, we have permitted the growth of such men as Ames, and allowed
them to monopolize the country's resources.Future
generations will laugh themselves sick over us!Why, what sane excuse
is there for permitting the commonest necessities of life to be
juggled with by gamblers and unmoral men of wealth?How can we ask to
be considered rational when we, with open eyes, allow 'corners' on
foodstuffs, and permit 'wheat kings' to amass millions by corralling
the supply of grain and then raising the price to the point where the
poor washerwoman starves?The
existence of poverty in a country like America is not only proof
positive that our social system is rotten to the core, but that our
religion is equally so!As a people we deserve to be incarcerated in
asylums!""A considerable peroration, Ned," smiled Hitt."And yet, one that I
can not refute.The only hope I see is in a radical change in the
mental attitude of the so-called enlightened class--and yet they are
the very worst offenders!"Doesn't the militia exist for men like Ames?To-day's work at
Avon proves it, I think!""Apparently so, Ned," returned Hitt sadly."And the only possibility
of a change in enlightened people is through a better understanding of
what is really good and worth while."Seems to me, Hitt, that it ought to stagger our preachers to realize
that nineteen centuries of their brand of Christianity have scarcely
even begun to cleanse society.What do you suppose Borwell thinks,
anyway?""Ned, they still cling to human law as necessarily a compelling
influence in the shaping of mankind's moral nature.""And go right on accepting the blood-stained money of criminal
business men who have had the misfortune to amass a million dollars!And, more, they actually hold such men up as patterns for the youth to
emulate!As if the chief end of endeavor were to achieve the glorious
manhood of an Ames!And he a man who is deader than the corpses he
made at Avon to-day!""The world's ideal, my friend, has long been the man who succeeds in
everything except that which is worth while," replied Hitt."But we
have been bidden to come out from the world, and be separate."Y--e--s, of course.But I can't take my thought from Avon--"

"And thereby you emphasize your belief in the reality of evil.""Then, if that is so, why not resign your position, Ned?Not while the Express has a leg to stand on!Your words are
an offense to me, sir!"Hitt rose and clapped his friend heartily on the back.Things do look very dark for us, if we look only with
the human sense of vision.But we are trying to look at the invisible
things within."Ned, Carmen is not in our hands.*       *       *       *       *

On the following afternoon at three a little group of Avon mill hands
crept past the guards and met in Father Danny's Mission, down in the
segregated vice district.They met there because they dared not go
through the town to the Hall.He had
slipped into town the preceding night, and remained in hiding through
the day.She had gone first to the
Hall, and then to the Mission, when she arrived again in the little
town.And after she had deposited Hitt's check in the bank she had
asked Father Danny to call together some of the older and more
intelligent of the mill hands, to discuss methods of disbursing the
money.Almost coincident with her arrival had come an order from Ames to
apprehend the girl as a disturber of the peace.The hush of death lay
over Avon, and even the soldiers now stood aghast at their own bloody
work of the day before.Carmen had avoided the main thoroughfares, and
had made her way unrecognized.At a distance she saw the town jail,
heavily guarded.Its capacity had been sorely taxed, and many of the
prisoners had been crowded into cold, cheerless store rooms, and
placed under guards who stood ready to mow them down at the slightest
threatening gesture.whispered Father Danny, after he had quietly
greeted the girl.It may be the beginning of the great
revolution we've all known wasn't far off!I just _had_ to get back
here!He sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.But soon he
sprang to his feet."No time for mollycoddling!""Come,
men, we'll give you checks, and do you get food for the babies.Only,
don't buy of the company stores!""We'll have to, Father," said one of them."But they've never taken cash from you there, ye know."Aye, Father, and they've discounted that ten per cent each time.But
if we bought at other stores we were discharged."But now then, Miss
Carmen, we'll begin."For an hour the girl wrote small checks, and the priest handed them
out to the eager laborers.They worked feverishly, for they knew that
at any moment they might be apprehended.cried Father Danny, at last unable to restrain himself."Did ye but know that this grand nation is wholly dependent on such as
you, its common people!Not on the rich, I say, the handful that own
its mills and mines, but on you who work them for your rich masters!"Ah, lass, it's but love that I'm dealin' out to 'em, God knows!And
yet, it's they that are masters of the situation, only they don't know
it!They've no leaders, except such as waste their
money and leave 'em in the ditch!The world's social schemes, Miss
Carmen, don't reach such as these.And they've got
the contempt of the wage-earners.""The Church, Father, could do much for these people, if--"

"Don't hesitate, Miss Carmen.You mean, if we didn't give all our
thought to the rich, eh?But still, it's wholly up to the people
themselves, after all.And, mark me, when they do rise, why, such men
as Ames won't know what's hit 'em!"The door was thrown violently open at that moment, and a squad of
soldiers under the command of a lieutenant entered.Carmen and Father Danny rose and faced them.The mill hands stood like
stone images, their faces black with suppressed rage.The lieutenant
halted his men, and then advanced to the girl."Is a woman named Carmen Ariza here?""I am she," replied the fearless girl."Come with us," he said in a rough voice.cried Father Danny, suddenly pulling the girl
back and thrusting himself before her.The mill hands
quickly formed about the girl.And then, with a yell of rage, they
threw themselves upon the soldiers.For a few minutes the little room was a bedlam.The crazed strikers
fought without weapons, except such as they could wrest from the
soldiers.One of them seized Carmen and
threw her beneath the table at which she had been working.The shouting and cursing might have been
heard for blocks around.Father Danny stood in front of the table,
beneath which lay the girl.He strove desperately to maintain his
position, that he might protect her, meantime frantically calling to
the mill hands to drag her out to the rear, and escape by the back
door.In the midst of the _melee_ a soldier mounted a chair near the door
and raised his rifle.The shot roared out, and Father Danny pitched
forward to the floor.Another shot, and still another followed in
quick succession.Then
they turned and fled precipitately through the rear exit.The lieutenant dragged Carmen from beneath the table and out through
the door.Then, assembling his men, he gave an order, and they marched
away with her up the icy street to the town jail.CHAPTER 16


With the wreckage which he had wrought strewn about him, J. Wilton
Ames sat at his rich desk far above the scampering human ants in the
streets below and contemplated the fell work of his own hands.And
often and anon as he looked, great beads of perspiration welled out
upon his forehead, and his breath came hot and dry.In the waste
basket at his feet lay crumpled the newspapers with their shrieking,
red-lettered versions of the slaughter at Avon.He was not a coward,
this man!But he had pushed that basket around the desk out of his
sight, for when he looked at it something rose before him that sent a
chill to his very soul.At times his vision blurred; and then he
passed his hands heavily across his eyes.He had chanced to read in
the grewsome accounts of the Avon massacre that little children had
been found among those fallen shacks, writhing in their last agonies.And the reports had said that great, red-dripping holes had been
ripped in their thin little bodies by those awful "dum-dum" bullets.And why had the demoniac soldiers down
there blown the brains from harmless women and helpless babes?He
really had not intended to go so far!The brats would have grown up to oppose
the vested privileges of the rich!They, too, would have become
anarchists and rioters, bent on leveling the huge industrial fabric
which such as he had so laboriously erected under the legal protection
afforded their sacred rights!And
the great captains of industry would thank him for the example he had
thus fearlessly set!To think of Avon was for him now to think in terms of blood.And yet
his carnal soul hourly wrestled sore with thoughts of a wholly
different stamp; with those strange emotions which he had felt when in
Carmen's presence; with those unfamiliar sentiments which, had he not
fought them back so bitterly, might have made him anew, and--

But the remembrance maddened him.His face grew black, and his mouth
poured forth a torrent of foul imprecations and threats upon her and
upon those who stood with her.He smote the
desk with his great fist.He fumed, he frothed, he hurled reason from
its throne, and bade the Furies again become his counselors.Upon the desk before him lay the mortgage papers which Hitt had
signed.He had bought the mortgage from the bank which had loaned the
Express the money.He would crush that sheet now, crush it until the
ink dripped black from its emasculated pages!And when it fell into
his hands, he would turn it into the yellowest of sensational
journals, and hoot the memory of its present staff from ocean to
ocean!Then, his head sunk upon his breast, he fell to wondering if he might
not secure a mortgage upon the Beaubien cottage, and turn its
occupants into the street.It was the
lever by which he moved the world, and clubbed its dull-witted
inhabitants into servile obeisance!Who could stand against him--

That girl!That obedient lackey hastened
into his master's presence."Called for this week, sir," replied Hood, glad that the announcement
could not possibly offend his superior."Brought up from Avon, and lodged in the Tombs, sir.""You tell Judge Spencer that if he allows her bail I'll see that his
federal appointment is killed, understand?"Ames regarded the man with a mixture of admiration and utter contempt.For Hood stood before him a resplendent example of the influence of
the most subtle of all poisons, the insidious lure of money.Soul and
body he had prostituted himself and his undoubted talents to it.And
now, were he to be turned adrift by Ames, the man must inevitably sink
into oblivion, squeezed dry of every element of genuine manhood, and
weighted with the unclean lucre for which his bony fingers had always
itched.He knows most about the formation of the defunct
Simiti company.""Well, see him and--you say he's young, and got a wife and baby?Offer
him twenty-five thousand to quit the case."Sandra went to the hallway."I'm afraid it wouldn't do, sir," returned Hood, shaking his head
dubiously."I've had men talking with him regarding the trial, and
he--"

"Then get him over here.I'll see if I can't persuade him," growled
Ames in an ugly tone.A few minutes later Reverend Darius Borwell
was ushered into the financier's private office.Ames," cried that gentleman of the cloth, "it's shocking,
terribly so, what those unbridled, unprincipled mill hands have drawn
upon themselves down in Avon!And four members of the Church
of the Social Revolution came to my study last evening and demanded
that I let them speak to my congregation on the coming Sabbath!"And I shall
have policemen stationed at the doors next Sunday to maintain order!To think that it has come to this in America!I would advise--"

"Nobody can get within a block of my house, sir, without ringing a
series of electric bells," replied Ames evenly."I have fifty guards
and private detectives in attendance in and about my premises all the
time.My limousine has been lined with sheet steel.I simply want to keep going
until I can carry out a few plans I have in hand."His thought had
reverted again to the fair girl in the Tombs."But now, Borwell," he continued, "I want to talk with you about
another matter.I am drawing up my will, and--"

"Why, my dear Mr.Ames thought of his physician's constantly iterated warning; but shook
his head."I may get caught in this Avon affair," he said evasively.The President has sent his message to
Congress, as you may be aware.There are unpleasant suggestions in it
regarding dispossession in cases like my own.I'm coming back by
magnanimously willing to Congress a hundred millions, to stand as a
fund for social uplift.""But the little matter I wish to discuss with you is the sum that I am
setting aside for the erection of a new church edifice," continued
Ames, eying the minister narrowly.cried that worthy gentleman, springing up and
clasping the financier's hand.One should not be too precipitate in
accepting tentative benefactions."Ah--we really should have--ah--a
trifle more, Mr.There's the settlement home, and the commons,
you know, and--"

"Humph!Well, we'll start with half a million," replied Ames dryly."By the way, you know Jurges, eh?Er--have
you any particular influence with him, if I may ask?"His sharp eyes
bored straight through the wondering divine."Why--yes--yes, I know the gentleman.And, as for influence--well, I
may--"

"Yes, just so," put in Ames."Now there is a trial coming up this
week, and Jurges will be called to the stand.I want you to give him
the true facts in regard to it.I'll call Hood, and we'll go over them
in detail now.Then you see Jurges this afternoon, and--say, he's
raising a building fund too, isn't he?"The magnate summoned Hood again; and for an hour the trio discussed
the forthcoming trial of the unfortunate Philip O. Ketchim.Then Ames
dismissed the clergyman, and bade his office boy admit the young
lawyer, Cass, who had come in response to Hood's request.For some moments after Cass entered the office Ames stood regarding
him, studying what manner of man he was, and how best to approach him.Then he opened the conversation by a casual reference to the
unsatisfactory business situation which obtained throughout the
country, and expressed wonder that young men just starting in their
professions managed to make ends meet."But," he concluded with deep significance, "better go hungry than
take on any class of business which, though promising good money
returns, nevertheless might eventually prove suicidal."He looked hard
at the young lawyer when he paused."But as I am
particularly busy this morning, may I ask why you have sent for me?Have you anything that I can--"

"I have," abruptly interrupted the financier."We need additions to
our legal staff.I thought perhaps you might like to talk over the
matter with me, with a view to entering our employ."Ames, I--I have never thought of--" The young man's eyes
glistened."Well, suppose you think of it now," said Ames, smiling graciously."I
have heard considerable about you of late, and I must say I rather
like the way you have been handling your work."The work which he had been
doing of late was most ordinary and routine, and called for no display
of legal skill whatever."I'd hate to see you tackle anything at this stage of your career, Mr.And I am afraid your
association with Ketchim is going to do just that.But possibly you do
not intend to handle further business for him?"Ketchim, though long confined in the Tombs, had at length secured
bail, through the not wholly disinterested efforts of his uncle,
Stolz, the sworn enemy of Ames.And, because of his loyal efforts in
behalf of Ketchim, Stolz had insisted that Cass be retained as counsel
for the latter when his trial should come up."I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr.Hood
will take you on at a salary of, say, five thousand to start with.We'll try you out for a few weeks.Then, if we don't mutually fit,
why, we'll quietly separate and say nothing.Half of that salary would have looked large to him
then.But--

"May I ask," he slowly said in reply, "what class of work Mr.Hood
would give me to start with?""Why, nothing of great importance, perhaps, while you are getting into
the harness.You've had experience
in that, eh?"That little house
which he had passed and stopped to look at so wistfully every night on
his way home was now within his grasp.He glanced up at the great man, sitting so calmly before him.Ames," he said, "if I enter your employ, it must be with the
stipulation that I shall have nothing to do with the Ketchim trial.""If you enter my employ, sir, it will
be with the stipulation that you do as I say," he returned coldly.And then the young lawyer saw through the mask.And his anger flamed
high at what he discerned behind it.Ames," said he, "you have made a mistake.I am poor, and I need
business.But I have not as yet fallen so completely under the spell
of fortune-hunting as to sell my honor to a man like you!To enter
your employ, I now see, would mean the total loss of character and
self respect.It would mean a lowering of my ideals, whatever they may
be, to your own vulgar standard.I may have done wrong in becoming
associated with Mr.But I
pledged myself to assist him.And yet, in doing so, I scarcely can
blacken my reputation to the extent that I should were I to become
your legal henchman.But there are some terms upon
which even I can not accept it.Ames gave a snort of anger when Cass went out.Summoning Hood, he
vented his great wrath upon that individual's bald pate."And now," he
concluded, "I want that fellow Cass so wound up that he will sneak off
to a lonely spot and commit suicide!And if you can't do it, then I'll
accept your resignation!"Ames, I have
just learned that Judge Harris, father of the young man who came up
with that girl, is in Colombia.Seems that he's taken some wealthy man
down there to look at La Libertad mine.""They believe you put one over on Ketchim, with the help of Monsignor
Lafelle, and so they've gone down to get titles to that mine.""By G--"

"And they say that--"

"Never mind what they say!""Cable Wenceslas at once to
see that those fellows remain permanently in Colombia.He has ways of
accomplishing that.I guess
Wenceslas can block his little game!"His great frame shook slightly as he stood consuming with rage, and a
slight hemorrhage started from his nostrils.And as he walked, Hood thought his left foot dragged
slightly.*       *       *       *       *

And then, with the way well cleared, came the Ketchim trial, which has
gone down in history as containing the most spectacular _denouement_
in the record of legal procedure in the New World.Had it been
concerned, as was anticipated, only with routine legal procedure
against the man Ketchim, a weak-souled compound of feeble sycophancy
and low morals, it would have attracted slight attention, and would
have been spread upon the court records by uninterested clerks with
never a second thought.But there were elements entering into it of
whose existence the outside world could not have even dreamed.Into it
converged threads which now may be traced back to scenes and events in
three continents; threads whose intricate windings led through
trackless forest and dim-lit church; through court of fashion and hut
of poverty; back through the dark mazes of mortal thought, where no
light shines upon the carnal aims and aspirations of the human mind;
back even to the doors of a palace itself, even to the proudest throne
of the Old World.But none of these elements found expression in the indictment against
the frightened defendant, the small-visioned man who had sought to
imitate the mighty Ames, and yet who lacked sufficient intelligence of
that sort which manifests in such a perversion of skill and power.Ames was a tremendous corruptionist, who stood beyond the laws simply
because of the elemental fact that he himself made those laws.Ketchim
was a plain deceiver.Mingling
his theology with fraud, he employed the unholy alliance for the
purpose of exploiting the credulous who attended his prayer meetings
and commented with bated breath upon his beautiful showing of
religious zeal.He was but one of a multitude afflicted with the
"dollar mania."His misfortune was that his methods were so antique
that they could not long fail of detection.And it was because of his
use of the mails for the purpose of deceit that the indictment had
been drawn against Philip O. Ketchim _et al._ by the long-suffering,
tolerant complainant, called the people.Nominally the people's interests were in the hands of the Public
Prosecutor, a certain smug young worldling named Ellis.But, as that
gentleman owed his appointment to Ames, it is not surprising that at
his right hand sat Hood and his well trained staff.Nominally, too,
Judge Spencer conducted the trial strictly upon its merits, not all of
which lay with the people.But the judge might have been still
prosecuting petty cases back in the unknown little district from
which he came, had it not been for the great influence of Ames, long
since, who had found him on a certain occasion useful.And so the jury
panel contained none but those who, we may be very sure, were amenable
to the tender pressure of a soft hand lined with yellow gold.And only
those points of evidence were sustained which conduced to the
incrimination of the miserable defendant.Ketchim was doomed before
the trial began.And yet, to subserve the dark schemes of Ames, and to lengthen the
period of torture to which his victims should be subjected, the trial
was dragged through many days.Besides, even he and his hirelings were
bound to observe the formalities.It was at the suggestion of Cass that no effort had been made to
procure bail for Carmen after her arrest.The dramatic may always be
relied upon to carry a point which even plain evidence negatives.And
she, acquiescing in the suggestion, remained a full two weeks in the
Tombs before Ames's eager counsel found their opportunity to confront
her on the witness stand and besmirch her with their black charges.The Beaubien was prostrated.But, knowing that for her another hour of
humiliation and sorrow had come, she strove mightily to summon her
strength for its advent.Father Waite toiled with Cass day and night.Hitt and Haynerd, without financial resources, pursued their way, grim
and silent.And
they stood at the helm, stanch to their principles, not yielding an
iota to offers of assistance in exchange for a reversal of the policy
upon which the paper had been launched."We're going down, Hitt," said Haynerd grimly."But we go with the
flag flying at the mast!"He was learning to know as did Carmen, and to
see with eyes which were invisible.It was just when the jury had been impaneled, after long days of petty
wrangling and childish recrimination among the opposing lawyers, that
Stolz came to Ames and laid down his sword.The control of C. and R.
should pass unequivocally to the latter if he would but save Ketchim
from prison.Then Ames lay back and roared with laughter over his great triumph.He would send Stolz' nephew to prison, and then roll a
bomb along Wall Street whose detonation would startle the financial
world clean out of its orbit!Stolz had failed to notice that Ames's
schemes had so signally worked out that C. and R. was practically in
his hands now!The defeated railroad magnate at length backed out of
the Ames office purple with rage.And then he pledged himself to
hypothecate his entire fortune to the rescue of his worthless nephew.Thus, in deep iniquity, was launched the famous trial, a process of
justice in name only, serving as an outlet for a single man's long
nurtured personal animosities.The adulterous union of religion and
business was only nominally before the bar.The victims, not the
defendant only, not the preachers, the washerwomen, the factory girls,
the widows, and the orphans, whose life savings Ketchim had drawn into
his net by the lure of pious benedictions, but rather those
unfortunates who had chanced to incur the malicious hatred of the
great, legalized malefactor, Ames, by opposition to his selfish
caprice, and whose utter defeat and discrediting before the public
would now place the crown of righteous expediency upon his own
chicanery and extortion and his wantonly murderous deeds.Doctor Jurges, utterly
confused by the keen lawyers, and vainly endeavoring to follow the
dictates of his conscience, while attempting to reconcile them with
his many talks with Darius Borwell, gave testimony which fell little
short of incriminating himself.For there were produced letters which
he had written to members of his congregation, and which for subtlety
and deception, though doubtless innocently done, would have made a
seasoned promoter look sharp to his own laurels.He had been summoned from Denver for the
trial.But his stuttering evidence gave no advantage to either side.And then--crowning blunder!--Cass permitted Ketchim himself to take
the stand.And the frightened, trembling broker gave his own cause
such a blow that the prosecution might well have asked the judge to
take the case from the jury then and there.It was a legal _faux pas_;
and Cass walked the floor and moaned the whole night through.Then, as per program, the prosecution called Madam Beaubien.Could not
that sorrowing woman have given testimony which would have aided the
tottering defense, and unmasked the evil genius which presided over
this mock trial?But not one point would the
judge sustain when it bordered upon forbidden territory.It was made
plain to her that she was there to testify against Ketchim, and to
permit the Ames lawyers to bandy her own name about the court room
upon the sharp points of their cruel cross-questions and low
insinuations.But, she protested, her knowledge of the Simiti company's affairs had
come through another person.Ames should give his own testimony--for was it not he who
had, not long since, legally punished the witness on a charge of
defamation of character?And the spectators
knew that it was because the righteous prosecution could no longer
stain its hands with one who bore such a tarnished name as she.And then, taunted and goaded to exasperation, the wronged woman burst
into tears and flayed the bigamist Ames there before the court room
crowded with eager society ladies and curious, non-toiling men.Flayed
him as men are seldom flayed and excoriated by the women they trample.The bailiffs seized her, and dragged her into an ante-room; the judge
broke his gavel rapping for order, and threatened to clear the court;
and then Cass, too young and inexperienced to avoid battle with
seasoned warriors, rose and demanded that Madam Beaubien be returned
to the stand.He turned to
the people, as if seeking their support.A great murmur arose through
the court room.That man, sitting calm
and unimpassioned, nodded his head slightly.And the woman was led
back to the chair."It may have an important bearing upon the case, Your Honor!"cried
the young lawyer for the defense.Ames is to take the stand as an
important witness in this case.If Madam Beaubien brings such a charge
against him, it gives us reason to believe his honor peccable, and his
testimony open to suspicion!"It was a daring statement, and the whole room gasped, and held its
breath."The
lawyer for the defense is in contempt of court!Madam Beaubien has
been shown to be a--"

"The objection is sustained!"_"His first wife's portrait--is in a glass window--in his yacht!"_
cried the hysterical Beaubien.Then she crumpled up in a limp mass,
and was led from the chair half fainting.At the woman's shrill words a white-haired man, dressed in black,
clerical garb, who had been sitting in the rear of the room close to
the door, rose hastily, then slowly sat down again.At his feet
reposed a satchel, bearing several foreign labels.Evidently he had
but just arrived from distant lands.Consternation reigned throughout the room for a few minutes.Then
Cass, believing that the psychological moment had arrived, loudly
called Carmen Ariza to the stand.The dramatic play must be continued,
now that it had begun.The battle which had raged back and forth for
long, weary days, could be won, if at all, only by playing upon the
emotions of the jury, for the evidence thus far given had resulted in
showing not only the defense, but likewise the Beaubien, and all who
had been associated with the Simiti company, including Cass himself,
to be participators in gross, intentional fraud.The remaining witness, the girl herself, had been purposely neglected
by the prosecution, for the great Ames had planned that she must be
called by the defense.Then would he bring up the prostitute, Jude,
and from her wring testimony which must blast forever the girl's
already soiled name.Following her, he would himself take the stand,
and tell of the girl's visits to his office; of her protestations of
love for him; of her embracing him; and of a thousand indiscretions
which he had carefully garnered and stored for this triumphant
occasion.But the judge, visibly perturbed by the dramatic turn which the case
seemed to be taking, studied his watch for a moment, then Ames's face,
and then abruptly adjourned court until the following day.Yet not
until Cass had been recognized, and the hounded girl summoned from her
cell in the Tombs, to take the stand in the morning for--her life!CHAPTER 17


In the days to come, when the divine leaven which is in the world
to-day shall have brought more of the carnal mind's iniquity to the
surface, that the Sun of Truth may destroy the foul germs, there shall
be old men and women, and they which, looking up from their work, peep
and mutter of strange things long gone, who shall fall wonderingly
silent when they have told again of the fair young girl who walked
alone into the crowded court room that cold winter's morning.And
their stories will vary with the telling, for no two might agree what
manner of being it was that came into their midst that day.Even the bailiffs, as if moved by some strange prescience, had fallen
back and allowed her to enter alone.The buzz of subdued chatter
ceased, and a great silence came over all as they looked.Some swore,
in awed whispers, when the dramatic day had ended, and judge and jury
and wrangling lawyer had silently, and with bowed heads, gone quiet
and thoughtful each to his home, that a nimbus encircled her beautiful
head when she came through the door and faced the gaping multitude.Some said that her eyes were raised; that she saw not earthly things;
and that a heavenly presence moved beside her.Nor may we lightly set
aside these tales; for, after the curtain had fallen upon the
wonderful scene about to be enacted, there was not one present who
would deny that, as the girl came into the great room and went
directly to the witness chair, God himself walked at her side and held
her hand."Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou
dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou
goest."Through the mind of that same white-haired man in the clerical garb
ran these words as he watched the girl move silently across the room.She seemed to have taken on a new meaning to him since the previous
day.And as he looked, his eyes grew moist, and he drew out his
handkerchief.But his were not the only eyes that had filled then.Hitt and Haynerd
bent their heads, that the people might not see; Miss Wall and the
Beaubien wept silently, and with no attempt to stay their grief; Jude
buried her head in her hands, and rocked back and forth, moaning
softly.A welter of conflicting emotions
surged through their harassed souls.They seemed to have come now to
the great crisis.And which way the tide would turn rested with this
lone girl.For some moments after she was seated the silence remained unbroken.And as she sat there, waiting, she looked down at the man who sought
to destroy what he might not possess.Some said afterward that as she
looked at him she smiled.Who knows but that the Christ himself smiled
down from the cross at those who had riven his great heart?He was far
from well that morning, and an ugly, murderous mood possessed him.And
yet, judged by the world's standards, he had tipped the crest of
success.He was swollen
with wealth, with material power, with abnormal pride.His tender
sensibilities and sympathies were happily completely ossified, and he
was stone deaf and blind to the agonies of a suffering world.Not a
single aim but had been realized; not a lone ambition but had been
met.Even the armed camp at Avon, and the little wooden crosses over
the fresh mounds there, all testified to his omnipotence; and in them,
despite their horrors, he felt a satisfying sense of his own great
might.The clerk held up the Bible for the girl to give her oath.She looked
at him for a moment, and then smiled."I will tell the truth," she
said simply.The officer hesitated, and looked up at the judge.But the latter sat
with his eyes fixed upon the girl.The clerk did not press the point;
and Carmen was delivered into the hands of the lawyers.Then, yielding to a sudden
impulse, he asked the girl to mention briefly the place of her birth,
her parentage, and other statistical data, leading up to her
association with the defendant.It was but the one she had
told again and again.And when
she had concluded, Cass turned her back again to Simiti, and to
Rosendo's share in the mining project which had ultimated in this
suit.A far-away look came into the girl's eyes as she spoke of that great,
black man who had taken her from desolate Badillo into his own warm
heart.There were few dry eyes among the spectators when she told of
his selfless love.And when she drew the portrait of him, standing
alone in the cold mountain water, far up in the jungle of Guamoco,
bending over the laden _batea_, and toiling day by day in those
ghastly solitudes, that she might be protected and educated and raised
above her primitive environment in Simiti, there were sobs heard
throughout the room; and even the judge, hardened though he was by
conflict with the human mind, removed his glasses and loudly cleared
his throat as he wiped them.Ames first grew weary as he listened, and then exasperated.His lawyer
at length rose to object to the recital on the ground that it was
largely irrelevant to the case.And the judge, pulling himself
together, sustained the objection.Then the prosecution
eagerly took up the cross-examination."Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
bring forth," murmured the white-haired man in the clerical garb far
back in the crowded room.Had he learned the law of Truth to error,
"Thou shall surely die"?Did he discern the vultures gnawing at the
rich man's vitals?Did he, too, know that this giant of privilege, so
insolently flaunting his fleeting power, his blood-stained wealth and
his mortal pride, might as well seek to dim the sun in heaven as to
escape the working of those infinite divine laws which shall effect
the destruction of evil and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven
even here upon earth?The latter drew Ellis down and
transmitted his master's instructions.The atmosphere grew tense, and
the hush of expectancy lay over all."Miss Carmen," began Ellis easily, "your parentage has been a matter
of some dispute, if I mistake not, and--"

Cass was on his feet to object.What had this question to do with the
issue?Cass should have divined it by this time.Ellis cleared his throat and adjusted his glasses."And your
father, it is said, was a <DW64> priest.I believe that has been
accepted for some time."I never knew my earthly father," replied Carmen in a low voice."But you have admitted that it might have been this Diego, have you
not?""It might have been," returned the girl, looking off absently toward
the high windows."Did he not claim you as his daughter?""Now," continued Ellis, "that being reasonably settled, is it not also
true that you used the claim of possessing this mine, La Libertad, as
a pretext for admission to society here in New York?"The girl did not answer, but only smiled pityingly at him.He, too,
had bartered his soul; and in her heart there rose a great sympathy
for him in his awful mesmerism."And that you claimed to be an Inca princess?"admonished the judge, looking severely down upon the silent
girl.Carmen sighed, and drew her gaze away from the windows.She was weary,
oh, so weary of this unspeakable mockery.And yet she was there to
prove her God."I would like to ask this further question," Ellis resumed, without
waiting for her reply."Were you not at one time in a resort conducted
by Madam Cazeau, down on--"

He stopped short.The girl's eyes were looking straight into his, and
they seemed to have pierced his soul."I am sorry for you," she said
gently, "oh, so sorry!The man knew not whether to smile in triumph or hide his head in
shame.Ames alone
met his embarrassed glance, and sent back a command to continue the
attack.What possible relation to the
issue involved could such testimony have?But the judge bade him sit
down, as the counsel for the prosecution doubtless was bringing out
facts of greatest importance.Ellis again cleared his throat and bent to his loathsome task."Now,
Miss Ariza, in reference to your labors to incite the mill hands at
Avon to deeds of violence, the public considers that as part of a
consistent line of attack upon Mr.Ames, in which you were aiding
others from whom you took your orders.May I ask you to cite the
motives upon which you acted?"Ames," she slowly replied, "but only the
things he stands for."A militant brand of social uplift, I
suppose?"And that is the sort of remedy that anarchists apply to
industrial troubles, is it not?""There is no remedy for industrial troubles but Christianity," she
said gently."Not the burlesque Christianity of our countless sects
and churches; not Roman Catholicism; not Protestantism; nor any of the
fads and fancies of the human mind; but just the Christianity of Jesus
of Nazareth, who knew that the human man was not God's image, but only
stood for it in the mortal consciousness.And he always saw behind
this counterfeit the real man, the true likeness of God.And--"

"You are diverging from the subject proper and consuming time, Miss
Ariza!"Carmen did not heed him, but continued quietly:

"And it was just such a man that Jesus portrayed in his daily walk and
words.""No," the girl went calmly on, "Jesus did not stand for the
intolerance, the ignorance, the bigotry, the hatred, and the human
hypothesis, the fraud, and chicanery, and the 'Who shall be greatest?'Nor did he make evil a reality, as mortals do.He knew it seemed awfully real to the deceived human consciousness;
but he told that consciousness to be not afraid.And then he went to
work and drove out the belief of evil on the basis of its nothingness
and its total lack of principle.The orthodox churches and sects of
to-day do not do that.Their
kingdom is wholly temporal, and is upheld by heartless millionaires,
and by warlike kings and emperors.Their tenets shame the intelligence
of thinking men!Yet they have slain tens of millions to establish
them!"To remove the girl meant depriving Ames of
his prey.But if she remained upon the stand, she would put them all
to confusion, for they had no means of silencing her.The judge looked
blankly at Ames; his hands were tied.Ellis hurried to change the current of her talk by interposing another
question."Will you tell us, Miss Carmen, why you have been working--"

"I have been working for God," she interrupted.Her voice was low and
steady, and her eyes shone with a light that men are not wont to see
in those of their neighbors.And for Him I am here to-day."Consternation was plainly discernible in the camp of the prosecution.Cass knew now that he need make no more objections.The defense had
passed from his hands.At this juncture James Ketchim, brother of the defendant, thinking to
relieve the strain and embarrassment, gave audible voice to one of his
wonted witticisms.But the effect was not
what he had anticipated.roared the exasperated judge, bending
far over his desk.And the elder
Ketchim retired in chagrin and confusion."Miss Carmen," pursued Ellis, eager to recover his advantage, for he
saw significant movements among the jury, "do you not think the
unfortunate results at Avon quite prove that you have allied yourself
with those who oppose the nation's industrial progress?"Order had now been restored in the court room, and
Ellis was feeling sure of himself again."You have opposed the constructive development of our country's
resources by your assaults upon men of wealth, like Mr.Ames, for
example, have you not?"Then the girl opened her mouth, and from it came words that fell upon
the room like masses of lead."I stand opposed to any man, Mr.Ellis,
who, to enrich himself, and for the purpose of revenge, spreads the
boll weevil in the cotton fields of the South."And yet it was a silence that
fell crashing upon Ames's straining ears.He sat for a moment stunned;
then sprang to his feet.He held out a
hand, and made as if to speak; then sank again into his chair.Ellis collected himself, and turned to the judge."Your Honor, we regret to state that, from the replies which Miss
Ariza has given, we do not consider her mentally competent as a
witness."I should
like to examine the witness further!"returned the judge, glowering over his spectacles
at the young lawyer."I stand on--"

"Sit down!"called Cass through the rising tumult, "the lawyer for
the prosecution has heaped insults upon you in his low references to
your parentage.Will you--"

The judge pounded upon his desk with the remnant of his broken gavel.he called in a loud, threatening
voice.The judge sat down and mopped his steaming face.Ames was a study of
wild, infuriated passion.Carmen
sat quietly facing the crowded room.She had reached up and was
fondling the little locket which hung at her throat.It was the first
time she had ever worn it.It was not a pretty piece of jewelry; and
it had never occurred to her to wear it until that day.Nor would she
have thought of it then, had not the Beaubien brought it to the Tombs
the night before in a little box with some papers which the girl had
called for.Why she had put it on, she could not say.Slowly, while the silence continued unbroken, the girl drew the
slender chain around in front of her and unclasped it."I--I never--knew my parents," she murmured musingly, looking down
lovingly at the little locket.Then she opened it and sat gazing, rapt
and absorbed, at the two little portraits within."But there are their
pictures," she suddenly announced, holding the locket out to Cass.It was said afterward that never in the history of legal procedure in
New York had that court room held such dead silence as when Cass stood
bending over the faces of the girl's earthly parents, portrayed in the
strange little locket which Rosendo had taken from Badillo years
before.Never had it known such a tense moment; never had the very air
itself seemed so filled with a mighty, unseen presence, as on that day
and in that crisal hour.Without speaking, Hood rose and looked over Cass's shoulder at the
locket.A muffled cry escaped him, and he turned and stared at Ames."Yes, sir," replied Hood in a voice that was scarcely heard.Hood seemed to have frozen to the spot.His hands shook, and his words
gibbered from his trembling lips."The--the woman's portrait, sir--is--is--the one in--in Mr."_

The piercing cry rang through the still room like a lost soul's
despairing wail.Ames had rushed from his seat, overturning his chair,
thrusting the lawyers aside, and seized the locket.For a moment he
peered wildly into it.It seemed as if his eyes would devour it,
absorb it, push themselves clean through it, in their eagerness to
grasp its meaning.His eyes were red; his face ashen; his lips white.His unsteady glance met the girl's.His mouth opened, and flapped like
a broken shutter in the wind.His arms swung wildly upward; then
dropped heavily.Suddenly he bent to one side; caught himself;
straightened up; and then, with a horrifying, gurgling moan, crashed
to the floor.The noise of the tremendous fall reverberated through
the great room like an echo of Satan's plunge into the pit of hell.They rushed forward in a mass, over railings, over chairs
and tables, heedless of all but the great mystery that was slowly
clearing away in the dim light that winter's morning.Through them the
white-haired man, clad in clerical vestments, elbowed his way to the
bar.He tore it from Hood's hand and scanned it eagerly.he murmured, trembling with
excitement.Then, shouting to the judge above the hubbub:

"Your Honor!called the judge in a loud, quavering voice.The woman's
portrait in this little locket is that of Dona Dolores, Infanta,
daughter of Queen Isabella the Second, of Spain!And this girl,"
pointing to the bewildered Carmen, who sat clinging to the arms of her
chair, "is her child, and is a princess of the royal blood!Her father
is the man who lies there--J. Wilton Ames!"CHAPTER 18


Borne on pulsing electric waves, the news of the great _denouement_
flashed over the city, and across a startled continent.Beneath the
seas it sped, and into court and hovel.Madrid gasped; Seville panted;
and old Padre Rafael de Rincon raised his hoary head and cackled
shrilly.To the seething court room came flying reporters and news gatherers,
who threw themselves despairingly against the closed portals.Within,
the bailiffs fought with the excited crowd, and held the doors against
the panic without.Over the prostrate form of Ames the physicians worked with feverish
energy, but shook their heads.In the adjoining ante-room, whither she had been half carried, half
dragged by Hitt when Ames fell, sat Carmen, clasped in the Beaubien's
arms, stunned, bewildered, and speechless.Hitt stood guard at the
door; and Miss Wall and Jude tiptoed about with bated breath, unable
to take their eyes from the girl.In the court room without, Haynerd held the little locket, and plied
Monsignor Lafelle with his incoherent questions.The excited editor's
brain was afire; but of one thing he was well assured, the Express
would bring out an extra that night that would scoop its rivals clean
to the bone!In a few minutes the bailiffs fought the mob back from the doors and
admitted a man, a photographer, who had been sent out to procure
chemicals in the hope that the portrait of the man in the locket might
be cleaned.Ten minutes later the features of J. Wilton Ames stood
forth clearly beside those of the wife of his youth.The picture
showed him younger in appearance, to be sure, but the likeness was
unmistakable.Monsignor, but you are slow!wailed Haynerd, shaking the
churchman's arm in his excitement."I saw the portrait in the Royal
Gallery, years ago, in Madrid.I could not forget the
sad, sweet face.I saw it again in the stained-glass window in the
Ames yacht.There was much whispering, much shaking of heads, but little
information.But this I know: the queen, the great Isabella, had a
lover, a wonderful tenor, Marfori, Marquis de Loja.And one day a babe
was taken quietly to a little cottage in the Granada hills.Rumor said
that it was an Infanta, and that the tenor was its father.One man, perhaps: old Rafael de Rincon.But Rome suddenly recalled
him from Isabella's court, and after that he was very quiet."Ames," he said, "traveled much in
Europe.He bought a vineyard in Granada--the
one from which he still procures his wine.And there--who knows?--he
met the Infanta.But probably neither he nor she guessed her royal
birth.""Well, they eloped--who knows?Whether married or not, I can not say.But it is evident she went with him to Colombia, where, perhaps, he
was seeking a concession from Congress in Bogota.Then came the news of his father's sudden death.Possibly he bade her wait for his return.But a
prospective mother is often excitable.She waited a day, a week--who
knows how long?she was wild
to do such a thing.She died at the little
riverine town of Badillo, after her babe, Carmen, was born."A heritage from her grandfather, the tenor, Marfori," Lafelle
suggested."But--the portraits--what is the name under that of Ames?"Yes, for Guillermo in Spanish is William.Doubtless Ames told her his
name was Will, contracted from Wilton, the name he went by in his
youth.And the nearest the Spanish could come to it was Guillermo.Diego's name was Guillermo Diego Polo.And after he had seen that name
in the locket he used it as a further means of strengthening his claim
upon the girl.""Then--she is--a--princess!""Yes, doubtless, if my reasoning is correct.Not an Inca princess, but
a princess of the reigning house of Spain."Haynerd could hold himself no longer, but rushed madly from the room
and tore across town to the office of the Express.Then came the white-enameled ambulance, dashing and careening to the
doors of the building where Ames lay so quiet.Gently, silently, the
great body was lifted and borne below.And then the chattering,
gesticulating mob poured from the court room, from the halls and
corridors, and out into the chill sunlight of the streets, where they
formed anew into little groups, and went over again the dramatic
events but a few minutes past.Then, too, emerged Carmen, heavily veiled from the curious, vulgar
gaze of the rabble, and entered the waiting limousine, with the
Beaubien and Hitt.Miss Wall and the gasping Jude followed in another.The judge had bidden the girl go on her own recognizance.The arrest
at Avon; the matter of bail; all had merged into the excitement of the
hour and been forgotten.Ketchim went out on Cass's arm.The judge had
ordered the clerk to enter an adjournment.*       *       *       *       *

All that afternoon and far into the night a gaping, wondering
concourse braved the cold and stood about the walk that led up to the
little Beaubien cottage.Within, the curtains were drawn, and Sidney,
Jude, and Miss Wall answered the calls that came incessantly over the
telephone and to the doors.Sidney had not been in the court room, for
Haynerd had left him at the editor's desk in his own absence.But with
the return of Haynerd the lad had hurried into a taxicab and commanded
the chauffeur to drive madly to the Beaubien home.And once through
the door, he clasped the beautiful girl in his arms and strained her
to his breast."My own, my very own little sister!We only
pretended before, didn't we?But now--now, oh, God above!The scarce comprehending girl drew his head down and kissed him."Sidney," she murmured, "the ways of God are past finding out!"Aye, for again, as of old, He had chosen the foolish things of the
world to confound the wise; He had chosen the weak to confound the
mighty; and the base things, and the things despised, had He used to
bring to naught the things that are.That no flesh might
glory in His terrible presence!The girl smiled up at him; then turned away.she kept repeating, groping her way about
the room as if in a haze.The still dazed Beaubien drew the girl into her arms.Yet I
called you that from the very first.And he--that
man--your father!"It--"

Then the Beaubien's heart almost stopped.What,
then, would this sudden turn in the girl's life mean to the lone woman
who clung to her so?"No, mother dearest," whispered Carmen, looking up through her tears."For even if it should be true, I will not leave you.He--he--"

She stopped; and would speak of him no more.But neither of them knew as yet that in that marvelous Fifth Avenue
palace, behind those drawn curtains and guarded bronze doors, at which
an eager crowd stood staring, Ames, the superman, lay dying, his left
side, from the shoulder down, paralyzed.*       *       *       *       *

In the holy quiet of the first hours of morning, the mist rose, and
the fallen man roused slowly out of his deep stupor.And then through
the dim-lit halls of the great mansion rang a piercing cry.For when
he awoke, the curtain stood raised upon his life; and the sight of its
ghastly content struck wild terror to his naked soul.He had dreamed as he lay there, dreamed while the mist was rising.He
thought he had been toiling with feverish energy through those black
hours, building a wall about the things that were his.And into the
design of the huge structure he had fitted the trophies of his
conquest.Gannette toiled with him, straining, sweating, groaning.Together they reared that monstrous wall; and as they labored, the man
plotted the death of his companion when the work should be done, lest
he ask for pay.And into the corners of the wall they fitted little
skulls.These were the children of Avon who had never played.And over
the great stones which they heaved into place they sketched red
dollar-marks; and their paint was human blood.A soft wind swept over
the rising structure, and it bore a gentle voice: "I am Love."But the
toilers looked up and cursed.And over the rim of the wall looked fair faces."We are
Truth, we are Life!"But the men frothed with fury, and hurled skulls
at the faces, and bade them begone!A youth and a tender girl looked
down at the sweating toilers."We ask help; we are young, and times
are so hard!"And then the darkness settled down,
for the wall was now so high that it shut out the sun.And the great
man howled with laughter; the wall was done.So he turned and smote
his companion unto death, and dipped his hands in the warm blood of
the quivering corpse.And then he sought to
mount the wall.But his hands slipped on the human blood of the red,
slimy dollar-marks, and he fell crashing back among his tinkling
treasures.The naked, splitting skulls
leered at him.The toothless jaws clattered, and the eyeless sockets
glowed eerily.He begged that a rope be
lowered.He would go out once more into the sunlit world.But the
chill wind brought him only despairing moans.Then he rushed madly to the wall, and smote it with his bare hands.It
mocked him with the strength which he had given it.He turned and tore
his hair and flesh.He gnashed his teeth until they broke into bits.He cursed; he raved; he pleaded; he offered all his great treasure for
freedom.But the skulls grinned their horrid mockery at him; and the
blood on the stones dripped upon his burning head.And above it all he
heard the low plotting of those without who were awaiting his death,
that they might throw down the wall and take away his treasure.And then his fear became frenzy; his love of gold turned to horror;
his reason fled; and he dashed himself wildly against the prison which
he had reared, until he fell, bleeding and broken.And as he fell, he
heard the shrill cackle of demons that danced their hellish steps on
the top of the wall.Then the Furies flew down and bound him tight."Ah, my God, What might I not have made of Thy fair world Had I
  but loved Thy highest creature here?It was my duty to have loved
  the highest; It surely was my profit had I known."Then he
sought to raise his arms, to move.And then the scream
tore from his dry throat.The physicians bent over him and
sought to soothe his mental agony.The man's torture was fearful to
behold; his weakness, pitiable.But the
sleep was one of unbroken horror; and those in the room stopped in the
course of their duties; and their faces blanched; and they held their
hands to their ears, when his awful moans echoed through the curtained
room.Through his dreams raced the endless panorama of his crowded life.Now
he was wading through muddy slums where stood the wretched houses
which he rented for immoral purposes.And then he hurried to Avon; and there he dug into those fresh
graves--dug, dug, dug, throwing the dirt up in great heaps behind him.And into the face of each corpse as he dragged it out of its damp bed
he peered eagerly.But with awful moans he threw them from him in
turn, for she was not there.Then he fled down, down, far into the burning South; and there he
roamed the trackless wastes, calling her name.And the wild beasts and
the hissing serpents looked out at him from the thick bush, looked
with great, red eyes, and then fled from him with loathing.And,
suddenly, he came upon another mound near the banks of a great river.And over it stood a rude cross; and on the cross he read the dim,
penciled word, _Dolores_.how he cried out for the oblivion
that was not his.But the ghastly mound froze his blood, and he rushed
from it in terror, and fell, whirling over and over, down, down into
eternal blackness filled with dying men's groans!The exhausted attendants stood about
the bed with bated breath.The physicians had called Doctor Morton in
consultation, for the latter was a brain specialist.And while they
sat gazing at the crazed, stricken giant, hopelessly struggling to
lift the inert mass of his dead body, Reverend Darius Borwell entered.He bowed silently to them all; then went to the bedside and took the
patient's hand.A moment later he turned to the physicians and
nurses."Let us ask God's help for Mr.They bowed, and he knelt beside the bed and prayed long and earnestly;
prayed that the loving Father who had made man in His image would take
pity on the suffering one who lay there, and, if it be His will, spare
him for Jesus' sake.He arose from his knees, and they all sat quiet for some moments.Then
Doctor Morton's heavy voice broke the silence of death.Borwell,"
he said in awful earnestness, extending his hand toward the bed, "cure
that man, if your religion is anything more than a name!"A hot flush of indignation spread over the minister's face; but he did
not reply."Gentlemen," he said solemnly, "Mr.Ames, I think, is past our aid.There is nothing on earth that can save him.If he lives, he will be
hopelessly insane.""Upstairs, sir, in her apartments," answered the maid, wiping her red
eyes."See that she remains there," said the doctor gruffly."Gentlemen,"
turning again to the physicians, "I have but one suggestion.Send
for--for--that little girl, Carmen.""It is ill-advised, Doctor," interrupted one of the men."It would
only further excite him."I do not agree with you," returned Doctor Morton."As it is, he is
doomed.With her here--there may be a chance."The others shook their heads; but Doctor Morton persisted stubbornly."If she is sent for, I shall
retire from the case.""Very well," announced Doctor Morton evenly, "then I will take it
myself."He rose and went out into the vestibule where there was a
telephone.Calling for the Beaubien cottage, he gave a peremptory
order that Carmen come at once in the automobile which he was sending
for her.The Beaubien turned from the telephone to the girl."Why--is it--is he--"

"They say he is--dying," the woman whispered.Carmen stood for a minute as if stunned."Why--I--didn't know--that
there was--anything wrong.The Beaubien threw her arms around the girl.Father Waite rose from
the table where he had been writing, and came to them.A few minutes later the great bronze doors of the Ames mansion swung
wide to admit the daughter of the house.Doctor Morton met the wondering girl, and led her directly into the
sick-room."Miss Carmen," he said gravely, "Mr.The girl turned upon him like a flash from a clear sky."You mean, he
_shall_ not live!"Then a sense of her
magnificent environment, of her strange position, and of the vivid
events of the past few hours swept over her, and she became
embarrassed.The nurses and attendants, too, who stood about and
stared so hard at her, added to her confusion."Listen," he said, "I am leaving now,
but you will remain.If I am needed, one of the maids will summon
me."Carmen stood for a moment without speaking.Then she walked slowly to
the bed and looked down at the man.Doctor Morton motioned to the
attendants to withdraw.Then he himself stepped softly out and closed
the door.When the girl turned around, she was alone--with death.CHAPTER 19


A curious, gossiping world, dwelling only in the froth of the human
mind, will not comprehend for many a year to come what took place in
that dim, tapestried chamber of the rich man in those next hours.When
twilight began to steal through the marble halls of the great,
shrouded mansion, the nurse in charge, becoming apprehensive, softly
opened the door of the sick-room and peeped in.Through the darkness
she saw the girl, sitting beside the bed, with the man's right hand
clasped in both of hers, and her head resting upon his shoulder.And
the nurse quickly closed the door again in awe, and stole away.The girl sat there all that day and all that night, nor would leave
but for brief moments to eat, or to reassure the Beaubien over the
telephone that all was well.Doctor Morton came, and went, and came
again.Carmen smiled, and held his hand for a moment each time, but
said little.And, more, his cheeks were stained where
the scalding tears had coursed down them.But the doctor would ask no
questions.And three days and nights passed thus, while Carmen dwelt with the man
who, as the incarnation of error, seeking the destruction of others,
had destroyed himself.Then Doctor Morton announced to a waiting world that his patient would
live--but he would say no more.And the world heard, too, that
Kathleen Ames had left her father's roof--left in humiliation and
chagrin when she learned that Carmen had come there to live--and had
gone to England for a prolonged visit with the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her now thoroughly dismayed son.But Sidney came; and with
him the black-veiled Beaubien.And they both knelt beside the bed of
suffering; and the hand of the now quiet man slowly went out and lay
for a moment upon their bowed heads, while Carmen stood near.Then
Willett was sent for; and he came often after that, and took his
master's scarce audible instructions, and went away again to touch the
wires and keys that ended the war of hatred at Avon; that brought
Father Danny in the master's private car to the great metropolitan
hospital; that sent to the startled Hitt the canceled mortgage papers
on the Express; and that inaugurated that great work of restitution
which held the dwellers in the Ames mansion toiling over musty books
and forgotten records for months to come.What had passed between the man and the sweet-faced girl who hovered
over him like a ray of light, no one may know.That he had trod the
glowing embers of hell, his cavernous, deep-lined face and whitening
hair well testified.It was said afterward that on that third day he
had opened his eyes and looked straight into those of the girl.It was
said that she then whispered but one word, "Father."And that, when
the sound of her low voice fell upon his straining ears, he had
reached out the arm that still held life, and had drawn her head down
upon his breast, and wept like a motherless babe.But what he had
said, if aught, about the abandoned mother who, on the banks of the
distant river, years gone, had yielded her life to him and his child,
no one knew.Of but one thing was there any certainty: the name of
Padre Jose de Rincon had not crossed their lips during those dark
days.Then strong men lifted the giant from his bed
and placed him in a wheel chair; and Carmen drew the chair out into
the conservatory, among the ferns and flowers, and sat beside him, his
hand still clasped in both of hers.That he had found life, no one who
marked his tense, eager look, which in every waking moment lay upon
the girl, could deny.His body was dead; his soul was fluttering
feebly into a new sense of being.But with the awakening of conscience, in the birth-throes of a new
life, came the horrors, the tortures, the wild frenzy of self-loathing;
and, but for the girl who clung so desperately to him, he would have
quickly ended his useless existence.The stage upon which the curtain had risen,
whereon he saw the hourly portrayal of his own fiendish deeds, stood
always before him like a haunting spectre; and as he gazed with
horrified eyes, his hair grew hourly white.And the torture was rendered more poignant by the demands of his
erstwhile associates and henchmen.They had taken fright at the first
orders which had issued from the sick-bed, but now they swooped down
upon the harassed man to learn what might be expected from him in the
future.What were to be his policies now in regard to those manifold
interests which he was pursuing with such vigor a few weeks ago?Was
he still bent upon depriving Senator Gossitch of the seat which the
Ames money had purchased?The
Amalgamated Spinners' Association must know at once his further plans.His great railroad projects, his
mining ventures, his cotton deals, his speculations and gambling
schemes--whither should they tend now?Ward bosses, dive keepers,
bank presidents, lawyers, magnates, and preachers clamored for
admission at his doors when they learned that he would live, but that
a marvelous, incomprehensible change had swept over him.The tired, hectored man turned to Carmen.And she called Hitt and
Waite and the keen-minded Beaubien.The latter's wide business
experience and worldly knowledge now stood them all in good stead, and
she threw herself like a bulwark between the stricken man and the
hounds that roared at his gates.There were those among them who, like
Ames, had bitterly fought all efforts at industrial and social reform,
and yet who saw the dawning of a new era in the realms of finance, of
politics, of religion.There were those who sensed the slow awakening
of the world-conscience, and who resisted it desperately, and who now
sat frightened and angered at the thought of losing their great
leader.Their attitude toward life, like his, had been wrong from the
beginning; they, like him, were striking examples of the dire effects
of a false viewpoint in the impoverishing of human life.But, with
him, they had built up a tremendous material fabric.And now they
shook with fear as they saw its chief support removed.For they must
know that his was a type that was fast passing, and after it must come
the complete breakdown of the old financial order.His world-embracing
gambling--which touched all men in some way, for it had to do with the
very necessities of life, with crops, with railroads, with industries,
and out of which he had coined untold millions--had ceased forever.And to him also came Reverend Darius Borwell, in whose congregation
sat sanctimonious malefactors of vast wealth, whose pockets bulged
with disease-laden profits from the sales of women's bodies and souls.Reverend Borwell came to offer the sufferer the dubious consolations
of religion--and inquire if his beautiful change of heart would affect
the benefaction which he had designed for the new church.Ah, this was the hour when the fallen giant faced the Apostle's awful
question: What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed?_For the end of those things is death!_

And then came Monsignor Lafelle, asking not to see the sick man, but
the girl.And, alone with her in the great library that day, he bent
low over her hand and begged that she would forgive and forget.Ames that flagrantly false tale of the girl's
parentage.He had received it from Wenceslas, in Cartagena.It was he
who, surmising the dark secret of Ames, had concluded that the
supposed Infanta had been his wife.And he had returned to New York
to confront him with the charge, and to make great capital out of it.But he had never suspected for a moment Carmen's connection with the
mystery.And now--

But the girl saw only the image of God in the humiliated man.And when
he kissed her hand and departed, she bade him know, always, that she
loved him as a brother.And he knew it, knew that her love was of the
spirit--it left all for the Christ.A few days later there was delivered at the Ames mansion a cable
message from Cartagena, in reply to one which the master had sent to
the lawyer, Estrella.Ames shook with suppressed excitement when he
read it.Then he bade Carmen send at once for Hitt, Willett, and
Captain McCall, and leave them with him for a private conference.Ames repeated, as the three
men sat leaning eagerly forward an hour later, drinking in every word
he spoke."If the mission is successful, well and good.If it fails,
then our silence now will be justified, for as yet I have said nothing
to her regarding him.Wenceslas has
won--but with--but of that later.When can you get under way,
McCall?"The sudden flash of his old-time energy nearly startled them
from their chairs."And," he added, "you, Mr.Now, Willett, have the door of my limousine widened to accommodate
this wheel chair.I want a dozen men to insure our privacy, and to
keep the way clear.No one not in our confidence must see us depart.""But--Carmen--"

"Goes with us," returned Ames."I can not spare her for a moment.Madam Beaubien will have charge of the house during our absence.We
will be back here, weather favorable, in three weeks--or not at all!""Yet, she will know--"

"Nothing.I take the trip, ostensibly, for the change; to get away
from those who are hounding me here; for recuperation--anything!The man's eyes glistened like live coals, and
his sunken cheeks took on a feverish glow.That night the _Cossack_, enveloped in gloom, steamed noiselessly out
of New York harbor, and turned her prow to the South.And when she
had entered the high sea, Captain McCall from his bridge aloft sent a
message down to the waiting engineer:

"Full speed ahead!"CHAPTER 20


Cartagena's slumber of centuries had been broken by nearly four years
of civil warfare.But on the day that the lookout in the abandoned
convent of Santa Candelaria, on the summit of La Popa, flashed the
message down into the old city that a steam yacht had appeared on the
northern horizon, she was preparing to sink back again into quiet
dreams.For peace was being concluded among the warring political
factions.The country lay devastated and blood-soaked; but the cause
of Christ had triumphed, and the Church still sat supreme in the
councils of Bogota.Cartagena was _en fete_; the last of the political
agitators would be executed on the morrow.And so the lookout's
message was received with indifference, even though he embellished it
with the comment that the boat must be privately owned, as no ships of
the regular lines were due to arrive that day.Quietly the graceful craft swept down past Tierra Bomba and into the
Boca Chica, between the ancient forts of San Fernando and San Jose,
and came to anchor out in the beautiful harbor, a half mile from the
ancient gate of the clock.A few curious idlers along the shore
watched it and commented on its perfect lines.And the numerous
officials of the port lazily craned their necks at it, and yawningly
awaited the arrival of the skiff that was immediately lowered and
headed for the pier.The tall American who stepped from the little boat and came at once to
them to show his papers, easily satisfied their curiosity, for many
tourists of the millionaire class dropped anchor in Cartagena's
wonderful harbor, and came ashore to wander among the decaying
mementos of her glorious past.And this boat was not a stranger to
these waters.On the yacht itself, as they glanced again toward it,
there was no sign of life.Even the diminishing volume of smoke that
rose from its funnels evidenced the owner's intention of spending some
time in that romantic spot.From the dock, Hitt passed through the old gateway in the massive
wall, quickly crossed the _Plaza de Coches_, and lost himself in the
gay throngs that were entering upon the day's festivities.Occasionally he dropped into wine shops and little stores, and
lingered about to catch stray bits of gossip.Then he slowly made his
way up past the Cathedral and into the _Plaza de Simon Bolivar_.For a while, sitting on a bench in front of the equestrian statue of
the famous _Libertador_, he watched the passing crowds.From time to
time his glance strayed over toward the Cathedral.Once he rose, and
started in that direction; then came back and resumed his seat.It was
evident that he was driven hard, and yet knew not just what course to
pursue.Finally he jumped to his feet and went over to a little cigar store
which had caught his eye.He bent over the soiled glass case and
selected several cigars from the shabby stock.Putting one of them
into his mouth, he lighted it, and then casually nodded to a
powerfully built man standing near.The latter turned to the proprietor and made some comment in Spanish.Hitt immediately replied to it in the same tongue.The man flushed
with embarrassment; then doffed his hat and offered an apology."I
forget, senor," he said, "that so many Americans speak our language."Hitt held out his hand and laughed heartily at the incident.Then his
eye was attracted by a chain which the man wore."_Cierto_, _senor_," returned the man cordially."It came from an
Indian grave up in Guamoco.I am a _guaquero_--grave digger--by
profession; Jorge Costal, by name."Somehow he seemed to be familiar with that
name.Somewhere he seemed to have heard it."Suppose," he said, in his excellent Spanish, "that we cross
the _Plaza_ to yonder wine shop.You may be able to tell me some of
the history of this interesting old town.And--it would be a great
favor, senor."The man bowed courteously and accepted the invitation.A few moments
later they sat at a little table, with a bottle between them,
commenting on the animated scene in the street without."Peace will be concluded to-day, they say," reflected Hitt, by way of
introduction."Yes," returned the man grimly, "there is but little more blood to
let."The other is--"

He stopped and eyed Hitt furtively.But the American manifested only a
casual interest."They were posted this morning," said the man."Amado Jesus Fanor and
Jose de Rincon.""A liberal general and an ex-priest."It is the custom to--to shoot ex-priests down
here, eh?"But this man--senor, why do you ask?""Well--it struck me as curious--that's all," returned Hitt, at a loss
for a suitable answer."You didn't happen to know these men, I
presume?""_Na_, _senor_, you seek to involve me.Who are you, that you ask such
questions of a stranger?"The man reflected the suspicious caution of
these troublous times."Why, _amigo_, it is of no concern to me," replied Hitt easily,
flicking the ashes from his cigar."I once knew a fellow by that name.Learned that he afterward went to Simiti.But
I--"

"Senor!""Are you the _Americano_, the man
who explored?""I am," said Hitt, bending closer to him."And we are well met, for
you are Don Jorge, who knew Padre Jose de Rincon in Simiti, no?"The man cast a timid glance around the room."Senor," he whispered,
"we must not say these things here!I leave you now--"

"Not yet!"He was first three years in the prison in Cartagena.But the Bish--"

"Eh?Don Wenceslas had him removed to San Fernando?""And--"

"He will be shot to-morrow, senor.""Why do you
say he is an ex-priest?""He has just been excommunicated," replied the man."Cursed, they say,
by bell, book, and candle."Of course Don Wenceslas would not dare to execute a priest in
good standing.And so he had him excommunicated, eh?""_Quien sabe?_" he muttered.Hitt sat for a while in a deep study.And yet it
was flying like the winds."You knew a little girl--in Simiti--in whom this Rincon was
interested?"She went to the great States
from which you come.And I think little was heard from her after
that."She lived with--"

"Don Rosendo Ariza.""Dead--he and his good wife, Dona Maria.""Come," he said, "we will stroll down by the walls.I would
like a look at San Fernando."Senor, you--you--"

Hitt threw him a look of caution, and shook his head.Then, motioning
him to follow, he led him out and down through the winding, tortuous
thoroughfares.On the summit of the walls were sentinels, posted at
frequent intervals; and no civilian might walk upon the great
enclosure until peace had been formally declared.Hailing a passing carriage, Hitt urged the wondering Don Jorge into
it, and bade the driver convey them to the old ruin of San Felipe, and
leave them.There they climbed the broken incline into the battered
fortress, and seated themselves in the shadow of a crumbling parapet.They were alone on the enormous, grass-grown pile.From their position
they commanded a wonderful view across the town and harbor, and far
out over the green waters of the Caribbean.The _Cossack_ lay asleep
in the quiet harbor.Don Jorge saw it, and wondered whence it came."Listen, _amigo_," began Hitt, pointing to the yacht."In that boat is
a girl, whose dearest earthly treasure is the condemned prisoner out
there in San Fernando.That girl is the little Carmen, foster-daughter
of old Rosendo.""_Hombre!_" cried Don Jorge, staring at Hitt as if he suspected his
sanity."It is true, friend, for I myself came with her in that boat.""_Caramba!_"

"And," continued Hitt, glancing again about the ruined fortress and
lowering his voice, "we have come for Jose de Rincon.""_Santa Virgen!_ Are you _loco_?""And now," he went on eagerly, "how are we to get him?"And he--_por
supuesto_, he will be in the dungeons!""No doubt," returned Hitt dryly, "if your excellent friend Wenceslas
has had anything to do with it."_Caramba_, yes; and San Fernando's are just above the water's edge.And when the waves are high the sea pours into them!""And--could we learn which window is his, do you think?""Senor, I know," replied the man.And--"

"I learned from one of the soldiers, Fernando, who once lived in
Simiti.I had thought, senor, that--that perhaps I--"

"That perhaps you might make the attempt yourself, eh?"Hitt sprang to his feet and looked out toward the
silent fortress."Don Jorge, it is dark out over the harbor at night, eh?Suddenly he stopped, and stood
looking down through a hole in the broken pavement.Then he knelt and
peered long and eagerly into it."It is one of the rooms
of the fortress," he said.I know not how it may be
reached.""But--you are a mighty husky fellow; and I am not weak.Suppose we try
lifting one of these flags.""_Na_, _senor_, as well try the tunnels!But, bidding Don Jorge follow, he sought the
fallen entrance to the old fortress, and plunged into the dark passage
that led off from it into the thick gloom.Groping his way down a
long, damp corridor, he came to a point where three narrower,
brick-lined tunnels branched off, one of them dipping into the earth
at a sharp angle.He struck a match, and then started down this,
followed by the wondering Don Jorge.A thousand bats, hideous denizens of these black tunnels, flouted
their faces and disputed their progress.Don Jorge slapped wildly at
them, and cursed low.Hitt took up a long club and struck savagely
about him.On they stumbled, until the match flickered out, and they
were left in Stygian blackness, with the imps of darkness whirring
madly about them.Hitt struck another match, and plunged ahead.At length they found the way blocked by a mass of rubbish which had
fallen from the roof.Hitt studied it for a moment, then climbed upon
it and, by the aid of the feeble light from his matches, peered into
the foul blackness beyond."Come," he said, preparing to proceed."_Na, amigo!_ Not I!""Then wait for me here," said Hitt, pushing himself through the narrow
aperture at the top of the rubbish, and fighting the horde of
terrified bats.A few minutes later he returned, covered with slime, and scratched and
bleeding."Now let's get out of this
miserable hole!"Out in the sunlight once more, Hitt sought to remove the stains from
his clothes, meanwhile bidding Don Jorge attend well to his words."Then do you come to the beach to-night to bathe, down across from the
yacht.And, listen well: you would do much for the little Carmen, no?You will swim out to the yacht at
seven to-night, with your clothes in a bundle on your head, eh?And,
Don Jorge--but we will discuss that later.Now you go back to the city
alone.And, note this, you have not seen me."Meantime, to the group of politicians, soldiers, and clergy assembled
in the long audience room of the departmental offices to debate the
terms of the peace protocol, news of the arrival of the _Cossack_ was
brought by a slow-moving messenger from the dock.At the abrupt
announcement the acting-Bishop was seen to start from his chair._Quien sabe?_ And, if so--but,
impossible!He would have advised his faithful co-laborer of his
coming.And yet, what were those strange rumors which had trickled
over the wires, and which, in his absorption in the local issues, and
in the excitement attendant upon the restoration of peace and the
settlement of the multifold claims of innumerable greedy politicians,
he had all but forgotten?A thousand suggestions flashed through his
mind, any one of which might account for the presence of the _Cossack_
in Cartagena's harbor that day.But extreme caution must be observed
until he might ascertain its errand.He therefore despatched a message
to the yacht, expressing his great surprise and pleasure, and bidding
its master meet him at a convenient hour in his study in the
Cathedral.This done, he bent anew to the work before him, yet with
his thought harried by doubt, suspicion, and torturing curiosity.Wenceslas soon received a reply to his message.The master was aboard,
but unable to go ashore.The acting-Bishop would therefore come to him
at once.Wenceslas hesitated, and his brow furrowed.He knew he was called upon
to render his reckoning to the great financier who had furnished the
sinews of war.But he must have time to consider thoroughly his own
advantage, for well he understood that he was summoned to match his
own keen wits with those of a master mind.And then there flashed through his thought the reports which had
circled the world but three short weeks before.The man of wealth had
found his daughter; and she was the girl for whom the two Americans
had outwitted him four years ago!And the girl--Simiti--and--ah,
Rincon!He would meet the financier--but
not until the morrow, at noon, for, he would allege, the unanticipated
arrival of Ames had found this day completely occupied.So he again
despatched his wondering messenger to the _Cossack_.And that
messenger was rowed out to the quiet yacht in the same boat with the
tall American, whose clothes were torn and caked with mud, and in
whose eyes there glowed a fierce determination.The harbingers of the wet season had
already arrived.At two in the morning the rain came, descending in a
torrent.In the midst of it a light skiff, rocking dangerously on the
swelling sea, rounded a corner of San Fernando and crept like a shadow
along the dull gray wall.The sentry above had taken shelter from the
driving rain.At one of the narrow, grated windows which were set just above the
water's surface the skiff hung, and a long form arose from its depths
and grasped the iron bars.A moment later the gleam of an electric
lantern flashed into the blackness within.It fell upon a rough bench,
standing in foul, slime-covered water.Upon the bench sat the huddled
form of a man.Then another dark shape rose in the skiff.Another pair of hands laid
hold on the iron bars.And behind those great, calloused hands
stretched thick arms, with the strength of an ox.An iron lever was
inserted between the bars.The heavy breathing and the low sounds of
the straining were drowned by the tropic storm.The prisoner leaped
from the bench and stood ankle-deep in the water, straining his eyes
upward.His
throbbing ears caught the splash of a knotted rope falling into the
water at his feet.Above the noise of the rain he thought he heard a
groaning, creaking sound.Those rusted, storm-eaten bars in the
blackness above must be slowly yielding to an awful pressure.He
turned and dragged the slime-covered bench to the window, and stood
upon it.Then he grasped the rope with a strength born anew of hope
and excitement, and pulled himself upward.The hands from without
seized him; and slowly, painfully, his emaciated body was crushed
through the narrow space between the bent bars.*       *       *       *       *

Cartagena awoke to experience another thrill.And then the ripple of
excitement gave place to anger.The rabble had lost one of its
victims, and that one the chief.Moreover, the presence of that
graceful yacht, sleeping so quietly out there in the sunlit harbor,
could not but be associated with that most daring deed of the
preceding night, which had given liberty to the excommunicated priest
and political malefactor, Jose de Rincon.Crowds of chattering,
gesticulating citizens gathered along the harbor shores, and loudly
voiced their disappointment and threats.But the boat lay like a thing
asleep.Not even a wisp of smoke rose from its yellow funnels.Then came the Alcalde, and the Departmental Governor, grave and
sedate, with their aids and secretaries, their books and documents,
their mandates and red-sealed processes, and were rowed out to
confront the master whom they believed to have dared to thwart the
hand of justice and remain to taunt them with his egregious presence.This should be made an international episode, whose ramifications
would wind down through years to come, and embrace long, stupid
congressional debates, apologies demanded, huge sums to salve a
wounded nation, and the making and breaking of politicians too
numerous to mention!But the giant who received them, bound to his chair, in the splendid
library of the palatial yacht, and with no attendant, save a single
valet, flared out in a towering rage at the gross insult offered him
and his great country in these black charges.He had come on a
peaceful errand; partly, too, for reasons of health.And he was at
that moment awaiting a visit from His Grace.What manner of reception
was this, that Cartagena extended to an influential representative of
the powerful States of the North!"But," the discomfited Indignation Committee gasped, "what of the tall
American who was seen to land the day before?"Why, but a poor, obsessed
archaeologist, now prowling around the ruins of San Felipe, doubtless
mumbling childishly as he <DW8>s the dust and mold of centuries!Go,
visit him, if they would be convinced!And when these had gone, chagrined and mortified--though filled
with wonder, for they had roamed the _Cossack_, and peered into
its every nook and cranny, and stopped to look a second time at the
fair-haired young boy who looked like a girl, and hovered close to
the master--came His Grace, Wenceslas.He came alone, and with a sneer
curling his imperious lips.And his calm, arrogant eyes held a
meaning that boded no good to the man who sat in his wheel chair,
alone, and could not rise to welcome him."A very pretty trick, my powerful friend," said the angered churchman
in his perfect English."And one that will cause your Government at
Washington some--"

"Enough!""I sent for you
yesterday, intending to ask you to release the man.I had terms then
which would have advantaged you greatly.You were afraid to see me
until you had evolved your plans of opposition.Only a fixed and
devilish hatred, nourished by you against a harmless priest who
possessed your secrets, doomed him to die to-day.But we will pass
that for the present.I have here my demands for the aid I have
furnished you.He held out some typewritten
sheets to Wenceslas.The churchman glanced hastily over them; then handed them back with a
smile."The terms on which
peace is concluded will scarcely admit of--"

"Very well," returned Ames quietly."_En manos muertas_, my friend," he replied.A government monopoly, you know," said His Grace easily."You see, my friend, it is a costly matter to effect the escape of
state prisoners.As things stand now, your little trick of last night
quite protects me.For, first you instruct me, long ago, to place the
weak little Jose in San Fernando; and I obey.Then you suffer a change
of heart, and slip down here to release the man, who has become a
state prisoner.That quite removes you from any claims upon us for a
share of the spoils of war.I take it, you do not wish to risk
exposure of your part in this four years' carnage?""Wenceslas," he
said, "I am not the man with whom you dealt in these matters.I have but one thing more to say, and that is that I renounce
all claims upon you and your Government, excepting one.La Libertad
mine was owned by the Rincon family.It was rediscovered by old
Rosendo, and the title transferred to his foster-daughter.Its
possession must remain with her and her associates.There is no
record, so you have informed me, to the effect that the Church
possesses this mine.""But, my friend, there shall be such a record to-day," laughed
Wenceslas."And, in your present situation, you will hardly care to
contest it."He now had the information which he had been seeking.The
title to the famous mine lay still with the Simiti company.He pressed
the call-button attached to his chair.The door opened, and Don Jorge
entered, leading the erstwhile little newsboy, Jose de Rincon, by the
hand.He knew not the man; but the boy
was a familiar figure."Your Grace, were you married to the woman by whom you had this son?"Don Jorge's steady words fell upon the churchman's ears like a
sentence of death."I ask," continued the dark-faced man, "because I learned last night
that the lad's mother was my daughter, the little Maria.""_Santa Virgen!_"

"Yes, Your Grace, a sainted virgin, despoiled by a devil!And the man
who gave me this information--would you like to know?_Bien_, it was
Padre Jose de Rincon, in whose arms she died, you lecherous dog!"Wenceslas paled, and his brow grew moist.He stared at the boy, and
then at the strong man whom he had so foully wronged."If you have concluded your talk with Senor Ames," continued Don
Jorge, "we will go ashore--you and the lad and I."Gaining the deck, Wenceslas
found a skiff awaiting them, and two strong sailors at the oars.Don
Jorge urged him on, and together they descended the ladder and entered
the boat.A few moments later they landed at the pier, and the skiff
turned back to the yacht.There were some who
remembered seeing His Grace pass through the narrow streets with a
dark-skinned, powerful man, whose hand grasped that of the young
newsboy.There were others who said that they saw the boy leave them
at the Cathedral, and the two men turn and enter.Still others said
they saw the heavy-set man come out alone.But there was only one who
discovered the body of Wenceslas, crumpled up in a hideous heap upon
the floor of his study, with a poignard driven clean through his
heart.That man was the old sexton, who fled screaming from the awful
sight late that afternoon.Again Cartagena shook with excitement, and seethed with mystery.Had
the escaped prisoner, Rincon, returned to commit this awful deed?For the dark-skinned man who had
entered the Cathedral with His Grace was seen again on the streets and
in the wine shops that afternoon, and had been marked by some mounting
the broken incline of San Felipe.Again the Governor and Alcalde and their numerous suite paid a visit
to the master on board the _Cossack_.But they learned only that His
Grace had gone ashore long before he met his fearful death.And so the
Governor returned to the city, and was driven to San Felipe.But his
only reward was the sight of the obsessed archaeologist, mud-stained
and absorbed, prying about the old ruins, and uttering little cries of
delight at new discoveries of crumbling passageways and caving rooms.And so there was nothing for the disturbed town to do but settle down
and ponder the strange case.A week later smoke was seen again pouring out of the _Cossack's_
funnels.That same day the Governor and Alcalde and their suites were
bidden to a farewell banquet on board the luxurious yacht.Far into
the night they sat over their rare wines and rich food, drinking deep
healths to the _entente cordial_ which existed between the little
republic of the South and the great one of the North.And while they
drank and sang and listened enraptured to the wonderful pipe-organ, a
little boat put out from the dark, tangled shrubbery along the shore.And when it rubbed against the yacht, a muffled figure mounted the
ladder which hung in the shadows, and hastened through the rear
hatchway and down into the depths of the boat.Then, long after
midnight, the last farewell being said by the dizzy officials, and the
echoes of _Adios_, _adios_, _amigos_!lingering among its tall spars,
the _Cossack_ slipped noiselessly out of the Boca Chica, and set its
course for New York.A few hours later, while the boat sped swiftly through the phosphorescent
waves, the escaped prisoner, Jose de Rincon, who had lain for a week
hidden in the bowels of old fort San Felipe, stood alone in the wonderful
smoking room of the _Cossack_, and looked up at the sweet face pictured
in the stained-glass window above.And then he turned quickly, for the
door opened and a girl entered.A rush, a cry of joy, and his arms
closed about the fair vision that had sat by his side constantly during
the four long years of his imprisonment."I knew you would, for he was with you always!""But--oh, you beautiful, beautiful girl!"Then in a little while she gently released herself and went to the
door through which she had entered.She paused for a moment to smile
back at the enraptured man, then turned and flung the door wide.The man uttered a loud
exclamation and started toward her.He stopped short and stared down at the boy.Then he looked
wonderingly at Carmen."Yes," she said, stooping and lifting the boy up before Jose, "it is
Anita's babe--_and he sees_!"The man clasped the child in his arms and buried his face in its
hair.Verily, upon them that sat in darkness had the Light shined.CHAPTER 21


Another summer had come and gone.Through the trees in Central Park
the afternoon sunlight, sifted and softened by the tinted autumn
leaves, spread over the brown turf like a gossamer web.And it fell
like a gentle benediction upon the massive figure of a man, walking
unsteadily beneath the trees, holding the hand of a young girl whose
beauty made every passer turn and look again."Now, father," laughed the girl, "once more!Why, you step off
like a major!"They were familiar figures, out there in the park, for almost daily
during the past few weeks they might have been seen, as the girl
laughingly said, "practicing their steps."And daily the man's control
became firmer; daily that limp left arm and leg seemed increasingly to
manifest life.On a bench near by sat a dark-featured woman.About her played her
boy, filling the air with his merry shouts and his imperfect English."There, father, comes Jose after us," announced the girl, looking off
with love-lit eyes at an approaching automobile.Now, mind, you are going to get into the car without any help!"The man laughed, and declared vehemently that if he could not get in
alone he would walk home.The profound depth of those changes which had come into the rich
man's life, he himself might not fathom.But those who toiled
daily with him over his great ledgers and files knew that the
transformation went far.There were flashes at times of his former
vigor and spirit of domination, but there were also periods of
grief that were heart-rending to behold, as when, poring over his
records for the name of one whom in years past he had ruthlessly
wrecked, he would find that the victim had gone in poverty beyond
his power to reimburse him.And again, when his thought dwelt on
Avon, and the carnal madness which had filled those new graves there,
he would sink moaning into his chair and bury his drawn face in his
hands and sob.And yet he strove madly, feverishly, to restore again to those from
whom he had taken.The Simiti company was revived, through his labors,
and the great La Libertad restored to its reanimated stockholders.Work of development had begun on the property, and Harris was again in
Colombia in charge of operations.The Express was booming, and the
rich man had consecrated himself to the carrying out of its clean
policies.The mills at Avon were running day and night; and in a new
location, far from the old-time "lungers' alley," long rows of little
cottages were going up for their employes.The lawyer Collins had been
removed, and Lewis Waite was to take his place within a week.Father
Danny, now recovered, rejoiced in resources such as he had never dared
hope to command.And so the rich man toiled--ah, God!if he had only known before that
in the happiness of others lay his own.If only he could have known
that but a moiety of his vast, unused income would have let floods of
sunshine into the lives of those dwarfed, stunted children who toiled
for him, and never played!Oh, if when he closed his mills in the dull
months he had but sent them and their tired mothers to the country
fields, how they would have risen up and called him blessed!If he
could have but known that he was his brother's keeper, and in a sense
that the world as yet knows not!For he is indeed wise who loves his
fellow-men; and he is a fool who hates them!The great Fifth Avenue mansion was dark, except where hung a cluster
of glowing bulbs over the rich mahogany table in the library.There
about that table sat the little group of searchers after God, with
their number augmented now in ways of which they could not have
dreamed.And Hitt, great-souled friend of the world, was speaking
again as had been his wont in the days now gone.Ah, yes, there is a
cure-all; there is a final answer to every ethical question, every
social, industrial, economic problem, the problems of liquor, poverty,
disease, war.And the remedy is so universal that it dissolves even
the tangles of tariff and theology.Ah, my friends, the
girl who came among us to'show the world what love will do' has
taught us by her own rich life--it is love.But not the sex-mesmerism,
the covetousness, the self-love, which mask behind that heavenly name.And to know Him is to receive that marvelous
Christ-principle which unlocks for mankind the door of harmony."No, the world's troubles are not the fault of one man, nor of many,
but of all who seek happiness in things material, and forget that the
real man is the likeness of spirit, and that joy is spiritual.The
trusts, and the men of wealth, are not all malefactors; the churches
are not wholly filled with evil men.But all, yes all, have'missed
the mark' through the belief that matter and evil are real, and must
grope amid sickness, poverty, crime, and death, until they are willing
to turn from such false beliefs, and from self, and seek their own in
the reflection of Him, who is Love, to their fellow-men.It is only as
men join to search for and apply the Christ-principle that they truly
unite to solve the world's sore problems and reveal the waiting
kingdom of harmony, which is always just at hand."In that day all shall know that cause and effect are mental.The man
who hears the tempter, the carnal mind's suggestion to enrich himself
materially at the cost of his brother, will know that it is but the
voice of mesmerism, that'man-killer from the beginning', which bids
him sever himself from his God, who alone is infinite abundance.The
society woman who flits like a gorgeous butterfly about the courts of
fashion, her precious days wasted in motoring, her nights at cards,
and whose vitality goes into dress, and into the watery schemes for
'who shall be greatest' in the dismal realm of the human mind, must
learn, willingly or through suffering, that her activities are but
mesmeric shams that counterfeit the divine activity which manifests in
joy and fullness for all.What is it but the Christ-knowledge, the knowledge of
good, and its correlated knowledge, that evil is only the mesmeric
lie which has engulfed the world?But, oh, the depths of that divine
knowledge!The knowledge which heals the sick, gives sight to the
blind, and opens the prisons to them that are captive!We who are
gathered here to-night, feeling in our midst that great, unseen
Presence which makes for righteousness, know now that 'in my flesh
shall I see God,' for we have indeed already seen and known Him."With them sat the man who, swept by the storms of error and the carnal
winds of destruction, had solved his problem, even as the girl by his
side told him he should, and had been found, when his foul prison
opened, sitting "clothed and in his right mind" at the feet of the
Christ.Jesus "saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit--God--like a
dove descending upon him--immediately the Spirit--carnal belief,
error, the lie--driveth him into the wilderness."And there he was
made to prove God.So Jose de Rincon, when the light had come, years
gone, in desolate Simiti, had been bidden to know the one God, and
none else.But he wavered when the floods of evil rolled over him; he
had looked longingly back; he had clung too tightly to the human
concept that walked with him like a shining light in those dark days.And so she had been taken from him, and he had been hurled into the
wilderness--alone with Him whom he must learn to know if he would see
Life.Then self-consciousness went out, in those four years of his
captivity, and he passed from thence into consciousness of God.Then his great world-knowledge he saw to have been wholly untrue.His
store of truth he saw to have been but relative at best.His knowledge
had rested, he then knew, upon viewpoints which had been utterly
false.And so, like Paul, he died that he might live.He crucified
Self, that he might resurrect the image of God."The world," resumed Hitt, "still worships false gods, though it
reaches out for Truth.Only a
state of consciousness, a consciousness of good, of joy and harmony.And
we are seeking to rid ourselves of the consciousness of evil, with
its sin, its disease and death.But, knowing now that consciousness
is mental activity, the activity of thought, can we not see that
harmony and immortality are within our grasp?Salvation is not from evil realities, but from the
false sense of evil, even as Jesus taught and proved.The only salvation
possible to mankind is in learning to think as Jesus did--not yielding
our mentalities daily to a hodge-podge of mixed thoughts of good and
evil, and then running to doctors and preachers when such yielding
brings its inevitable result in sickness and death.Jesus insisted that
the kingdom of heaven was within men, a tremendous potentiality
within each one of us.By removing hampering
false belief, by removing the limitations of superstition and human
opinion which hold its portals closed.True progress is the release of
mankind from materialism, with its enslaving drudgery, its woes, and
its inevitable death.Mankind's chief difficulty is ignorance of what
God is.He proved Him to be the
creator of the spiritual universe, but not the originator of the lie
of materiality.He showed matter to be but the manifestation of the
false belief that creation is material.He showed it to be but a
sense-impression, without life, without stability, without existence,
except the pseudo-existence which it has in the false thought of
which the human or carnal consciousness is formed.But the lack of
understanding of the real nature of matter, and the persistent belief in
the stability of its so-called laws, has resulted in centuries of
attempts to discredit the Bible records of his spiritual demonstrations
of God's omnipotence and immanence, and so has prevented the human mind
from accepting the proofs which it so eagerly sought.And now, after
nineteen centuries of so-called Christian teaching, the human mind
remains still deeply embedded in matter, and subject to the
consentaneous human beliefs which it calls material laws.Jesus
showed that it was the communal mortal mind, with its false beliefs
in matter, sin, disease, and death, that constituted 'the flesh'; he
showed that mortals are begotten of such false beliefs; he showed
that the material universe is but manifested human belief.And we
know from our own reasoning that we see not things, but our _thoughts_
of things; that we deal not with matter, but with material mental
concepts only.We know that the preachers have woefully missed the
mark, and that the medicines of the doctors have destroyed more lives
than wars and famine, and yet will we not learn of the Master?To reach
God through material thinking is utterly impossible, for He is spirit,
and He can be cognized only by a spiritual consciousness.Yet such a
consciousness is ours, if we will but have it."Ah, friends, God said: Let US make man in OUR image and likeness--let
Life, Love, Spirit make its spiritual reflection.But where is that
man to-day?Buried deep beneath the dogma and the crystallized human
beliefs of mortals--buried beneath 'the lie' which mankind accept
about truth.Nothing but _scientific_ religion will meet humanity's
dire needs and reveal that man.And scientific religion admits of
actual, practical proof.Christianity is as scientific as mathematics,
and quite as capable of demonstration.Its proofs lie in doing the
works of the Master.He is a Christian who does these works; he who
does not is none.Christianity is not a failure, but organized
ecclesiasticism, which always collapses before a world crisis, has
failed utterly.The hideous chicane of imperial government and
imperial religion against mankind has resulted in a Christian veneer,
which cracks at the first test and reveals the unchanged human brute
beneath.The nations which writhe in deadly embrace to-day have never
sought to prove God.They but emphasize the awful fact that the human
mind has no grasp upon the Principle which is God, and at a time of
crisis reverts almost instantly to the primitive, despite so-called
culture and civilization.Yes, religion as a perpetuation of ancient
human conceptions, of materialistic traditions and opinions of 'the
Fathers,' is a flat failure.By it the people of great nations have
been molded into servile submission to church and ruler--have been
persuaded that wretchedness and poverty are eternal--that heaven is a
realm beyond the grave, to which admission is a function of outward
oblation--and that surcease from ills here, or in the life to come, is
a gift of the Church.Can we wonder that commercialism is mistaken by
nations for progress?That king and emperor still call upon God to
bless their barbaric attempts at conquest?And that human existence
remains, what it has always been, a ghastly mockery of Life?"Healing the sick by applied Christianity is not the attempt to alter
a mental concept; it is the bringing out of harmony where before was
discord.He who indulges evil only
proves his belief in its reality and power.Christian healing is not
'mental suggestion,' wherein all thought is material.When evil
thinking is overcome, then the discords which result from it will
disappear from consciousness.Behind all
that the physical senses seem to see, know, and feel, is the spiritual
fact, perfect and eternal.Jesus healed the sick by establishing this
fact in the human consciousness.They must cease from the dust-man,
whose breath is in his nostrils; they must cease from preaching evil
as an awful reality, permitted by God, or existing despite Him; they
must know it as Jesus bade all men know it, as the lie about Truth.Then, by holding the divine ideal before the human mind, they will
cause that mentality gradually to relinquish its false beliefs and
copy the real.And thus, step by step, changing from better to better
beliefs, at length the human mind will have completely substituted
reality for unreality, and will be no more, even in thought.The 'old
man' will have given place to the 'new.'Yes, for the present we reckon with material
symbols; we have not yet fully learned their unreality.But at length,
if we are faithful, we shall lay them aside, and know only Truth and
its pure manifestations."Ah, my friends, how simple is Christianity!It is summed up in the
Sermon on the Mount.He who thinks
right shall know things as they are.He who thinks wrong shall seem to
know them as they are not, and shall pass his days in sore travail,
even in wars, famine, and utter misery.Then why not take up the
demonstration of Christianity in the spirit of joy and freedom from
prejudice with which we pursue our earthly studies, and as gladly,
thankfully seek to prove it?For it, of all things, is worth while.It
alone is the true business of men.For if what we have developed in
our many talks regarding God, man, and the mental nature of the
universe and all things is true, then are the things with which men
now occupy themselves worth while?But are the
things which we have developed true?Yes, for they can be and have
been demonstrated.Carmen has
shown us the way.No, she is not unnatural; she is only divinely
natural.She has shown us what we all may become, if we but will.She
has shown us what we shall be able to do when we are completely lost
in accord with God, and recognize no other life, substance, nor law
than His.But--

"'I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create
evil,' cried the prophet._Truth always has its suppositional
opposite!_ Choose ye then whom ye will serve.Only that which is demonstrably true, not after the change which we
call death, but here this side of the grave, can stand.The only test
of a Christian is in the'signs following.'Without them his faith is
but sterile human belief, and his god but the distorted human concept
whom kings beseech to bless their slaughter."'Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein
  is he to be accounted of?"'His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very
  day his thoughts perish."'That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
  of the Spirit is spirit."'Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though
  we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we
  him no more.'"The fire crackled briskly on the great hearth.Carmen rose and turned
off the light above them.All drew their chairs about the cheery
blaze.Silence, sacred, holy, lay upon them.The rich man, now possessing
treasures beyond his wildest dreams, sat holding his daughter's hand.Sidney had just entered; and Haynerd had
sent word that he would join them soon.Then the silence was broken by the rich man.His voice was unsteady
and low."My friends, sorrow and joy fill my heart to-night.To the first I am
resigned; it is my due; and yet, were it greater, I know not how I
could live.But the joy--who can understand it until he has passed
through death into life!This little girl's mother knew not, nor did
I, that she was royal born.Sometimes I wonder now if it is really so.And yet the evidence is such that I can scarcely doubt.We met in the
sun-kissed hills of Granada; and we loved.Her old nurse was
Argus-eyed; and our meetings were such as only lovers can effect.I
was young, wild, and my blood coursed like a torrent through my veins!But I loved her, yes, base though I was, I loved her.And in these
years since I left her in that little house in Bogota, I have suffered
the agonies of the lost when her memory and my own iniquity fell upon
me and smote me sore--

"We were married in Spain, and the marriage was performed by Padre
Rafael de Rincon.""I was rich; I was roaming the
world, extending my vast business interests; and I took her to
Colombia, where I labored with the politicians in Bogota to grant me
timber and cattle concessions.We had a cottage on the outskirts of
the city, where we were happy.With us lived her faithful old nurse,
whom she would not leave in Spain--

"Then, one day, came a cable message that my father had died.I knew I must return at once to New York.But--I would
not take a wife back with me!And I kissed
her tear-stained face, and bade her wait, for I would return and make
her happy.And then--

"Months later I wrote to her, and, receiving no reply, I caused
inquiry to be made.But she had gone--whither, no one knew.The old
nurse, too, had disappeared.I never learned that a woman had been
left at Badillo to die.She was
timid, and went out seldom.And then--then I thought that a marriage
here would strengthen my position, for I was powerful and proud."Oh, the years that her sad face haunted me!I know
not why, but when the _Cossack_ was built I had her portrait in glass
set in the smoking room.And night after night I have sat before it
and cursed myself, and implored her to forgive!"I was Guillermo to her, and she Dolores to me.Had Carmen ever worn it in my presence I
must have recognized it at once."But," said Ames, choking down his sorrow, "that man is dead.He, like
Goliath, fought Truth, and the Truth fell upon him, crushing him to
powder.The man who remains with you now lives only in this little
girl.And she has brought me my own son, Sidney, and another, Jose.All that I have is theirs, and they will give it to the world.I would
that she could have brought me that noble black man, Rosendo, who laid
down his beautiful life when he saw that his work was done.I learn
from my inquiries that he and Dona Maria lived with Don Nicolas far up
the Boque river during the troublous times when Simiti was burned and
devastated.And that, when the troops had gone, they returned to their
desolated home, and died, within a month of each other.And can my care of their daughter Ana and her little son
ever cancel the debt?"Father, does Jose know that it was Kathleen
whom he rescued from the Tiber in Rome, years ago, and who caused him
to lose his notebook?""No, Sidney,
we had not told him.And how inextricably
bound together we all are!And, Jose, I have not told you that the
woman who lived and died alone in the limestone caves near Honda, and
whose story you had from Don Jorge in Simiti, was doubtless the
faithful old nurse of Dolores.Padre Rafael de Rincon maintained her there."Haynerd entered the room at that moment, and with him came Miss Wall."Now," said Hitt softly, "the circle is complete.Carmen, may I--"

The girl rose at once and went into the music room.Those who remained
sat in awed, expectant silence.Another presence stole softly in, but
they saw him not.Soon through the great rooms and marble halls
drifted the low, weird melody which the girl had sung, long before, in
the dreary Elwin school.In the flickering light of the fire strange shapes took form; and the
shadows that danced on the walls silhouetted scenes from the dimming
past.From out their weird imagery rose a single form.Slowly it rose before them from out the shadows.It was black of face, but its wondrous heart which had cradled the
nameless babe of Badillo glistened like drifting snow.The last sweet notes of the plaintive Indian lament fluttered from the
girl's lips, echoed among the marble pillars, and died away down the
distant corridors.She returned and bent over her father with a tender
caress.Then the great black man in the shadows extended his arms for a moment
above them, and faded from their sight.There was the sound of low
weeping in the room.For

  "these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
  washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
  Lamb."GLOSSARY

vague hopes, he had always dimly seen the day when she would leave
him; but he had likewise tried to feel that when it arrived his own
status would be such that the ecclesiastical ties which bound him
would be loosened, and he would be free to follow her.the lapse
of years had brought little change in that respect.But now he saw the girl entering upon that very hour of departure
which all his life in Simiti had hung like a menacing cloud above
him.And the shock had been such that he had thrown every other
consideration to the winds, and, regardless of consequences, was madly
preparing to accompany her.Then, like a voice from the tomb, had come
his mother's letter.Indeed, for the past two nights sleep had
avoided his haggard eyes.In the feeble glow of his candle he sat in
his little bedroom by his rough, bare table, far into the hours of
morning, struggling, resolving, hoping, despairing--and, at last,
yielding.If he had been born anew that fateful day, seven years
before, when Rosendo first told him the girl's story, he had this
night again died.When the gray hours of dawn stole silently across
the distant hills he rose.He staggered as he passed out through the living room where
lay the sleeping Americans.Rosendo met him in front of the house.exclaimed the old man as he noted the priest's appearance."Do not speak of it, Rosendo."It has been hard on you, Padre.And in the States with her--"

"For God's sake, friend, never speak of that again!"How long will it take to complete your preparations?""_Bien_," returned the amazed Rosendo when he recovered his breath,
"we can get away to-morrow."But you--"

"Hear me, friend.Everything must be conducted in the greatest
secrecy.It must be given out that the Americans go to explore the
Boque; that you accompany them as guide; that Carmen goes as--as cook,
why not?""_Cierto_, she cooks as well as Maria."Juan must be kept in complete ignorance of the real nature
of your trip.He is the courier--I will see
that Fernando sends him again to Bodega Central to-morrow, and keeps
him there for several days.You say it is some two hundred miles to
Llano.How long will it take to go that distance?""Why--_Quien sabe_, Padre?""With a
fair trail, and allowing the _Americanos_ some time to prospect on the
Boque--where they will find nothing--and several days to look over La
Libertad, we ought to reach Llano in six weeks.""A week later, if you do not have to wait a month on the river bank
for the boat.""Then, all going well, within two months Carmen should be out of the
country."You and she--"

"Enough, friend."Go now and bid Carmen come to me immediately after the _desayuno_.Tell Dona Maria that I will eat nothing this morning.I am going up to
the old church on the hill."But Jose turned abruptly and
started away, leaving the old man in a maze of bewilderment.In the gloom of the old church Jose threw himself upon a bench near
the door, and waited torpidly.A few moments later came a voice, and
then the soft patter of bare feet in the thick dust without.Carmen
was talking as she approached.Jose rose in curiosity; but the girl
was alone.In her hand she held a scrubby flower that had drawn a
desperate nourishment from the barren soil at the roadside.She
glanced up at Jose and smiled."It is easy to understand their language, isn't it, Padre?They don't
speak as we do, but they reflect.They stand for His ideas in the human mind.And I. Aren't they wonderful, these flowers!But you know,
they are only the way we interpret certain of God's wonderful ideas.Only, because we mortals believe in death, we see these beautiful
things at last reflecting our thought of death--don't we?We see only
our thoughts, after all.Everything we see about us is reflected
thought.First we see our thoughts of life and beauty and good.And
then our thoughts of decay and death."But God--He never sees anything but the good," she went on."He sees
the real, not the supposition.And when we learn to see only as He
does, why, then we will never again see death.We will see ourselves
as we really are, immortal.Jesus learned
to see that way, didn't he?His thought was finally so pure that he
saw nothing but good.And that gave him such power that he did those
things that the poor, ignorant, wrong-thinking people called miracles.But they were only the things that you and I and everybody else ought
to be doing to-day--and would be doing, if we thought as he did,
instead of thinking of evil."But," she panted, as she sat down beside him, "I've talked a lot,
haven't I?And you sent for me because you wanted to talk.But,
remember," holding up an admonitory finger, "I shall not listen if you
talk anything but good.Oh, Padre dear," looking up wistfully into his
drawn face, "you are still thinking that two and two are seven!How can you ever expect to see good if
you look only at evil?If I looked only at wilted flowers I would
never know there were any others.""Carmen," he said in a hollow voice, "I love you.""Why, of course you do," returned the artless girl.You have just _got_ to love me and everything and everybody.But it had been floating like foam on
his tossing mind."You are going away from me," he continued, almost in a whisper."Why, no, Padre," she replied quickly; "you are going too!Padre
Rosendo said we could start to-morrow at sunrise.""I do not go," he said in a quavering voice.What meant this change which had
come over him so suddenly?His mother's face hovered before him in the dim light.Behind her
a mitered head, symbolizing the Church, nodded and beckoned
significantly.Back of them, as they stood between him and the
girl, he saw the glorified vision of Carmen.He
turned wearily from it to the gentle presence at his side."I stay--to work out--my problem," was his scarcely audible reply.But her breath came more quickly, and her hand
closed more tightly about his."Dearest one," he murmured, bending over the brown curls, "it is God's
way, I guess.Perhaps in the years which I have spent here with you I
have had the time and the opportunity to work out my salvation.But, though I strove in my way, I could not quickly
acquire your spirituality.I could not at once shake loose those
poisonous thoughts of a lifetime, which have at last become
externalized in separation from all that I hold dearest in this life,
you, my beloved girl, you."He buried his face in her luxuriant hair
and strove to hold back the rush of scalding tears."It but shows how poisonous thoughts separate us from all that is
good--even from God," he continued in a choked voice."Oh, my sweet
girl, I love you as it seems to me no human being could love another!It has been so from that first day when, a mere babe, your wonderful
eyes held me until I could read in them a depth of love for mankind
that was divine."It did not seem to him that a mature man was
speaking to a mere girl.She seemed, as always, ages beyond him in
wisdom and experience.Carmen reached up and wound her arms about his neck.He bent low and
kissed her brow.Then he drew himself up quickly and resumed his
broken talk."I believed at first that my salvation lay in you.And so it did, for
from your clear thought I gleaned my first satisfying knowledge of the
great principle, God.I could not seem to realize that
between recognizing righteousness as 'right-thinking' and daily
practicing it so as to 'prove' God there was a great difference.And
so I rested easy in my first gleams of truth, expecting that they
would so warm my soul that it would expand of itself out of all
error."She made as if to reply, but he checked her."I learned enough, I repeat, those first few months here to have
enabled me to work out my salvation, even though with fear and
trembling.But I procrastinated; I vacillated; I still clung to
effete beliefs and forms of thought which I knew were bound to
manifest in unhappiness later.I was afraid to boldly throw myself
upon my thought.Yes, the great Paul was at times
under the same mesmeric spell of human belief, even after he had seen
the vision of the Christ.And now
I see that I must do likewise, for salvation is an individual
experience.No vicarious effort, even of the Christ himself, can save
a man.We must apply it to our
problems ourselves.My unfinished task--scarcely even begun!--lies
still before me.My environment is what I have made it by my own
thought.I believe you, that I can enter another only as I externalize
it through righteousness, right-thinking, and 'proving' God."He paused and bent over the silent little figure nestling so quietly
at his side."You, Carmen, though but a child in years, have risen beyond me, and
beyond this lowly encompassment.Why, when you were a mere babe, you
should have grasped your padre Rosendo's casual statement that 'God is
everywhere,' and shaped your life to accord with it, I do not know.That must remain one of the hidden mysteries of God.But
the fact stands that you did grasp it, and that with it as a light
unto your feet you groped your way out of this environment, avoiding
all pitfalls and evil snares, until to-day you stand at the threshold
of another and higher one.So progress must ever be, I now realize.Up
we must rise from one plane of human mentality to another, sifting and
sorting the thoughts that come to us, clinging to these, discarding
those, until, even as you have said, we learn at last instantly to
accept those that mirror forth God, infinite, divine mind, and to
reject those that bear the stamp of supposition.""Padre," the girl said, lifting her beautiful face to his, "I have
told you so often--when a thought comes to me that I think is not from
God, or does not reflect Him, I turn right on it and kill it.You
could do the same, if you would.""Assuredly, child--if I would!"And then the millennium would be with us, and the
kingdom of heaven revealed.The mesmeric belief in evil as an entity
and a power opposed to good alone prevents that.Destroy this belief,
and the curtain will instantly rise on eternity."His eyes struggled with hers, as he gazed long and wistfully into
them.Lost in his impassioned speech, he had for the moment seemed to
be translated.Then a surge of fear-thoughts swept him, and left him
dwelling on the hazardous journey that awaited her.He wildly clutched
her again to his side."Carmen--child--how can I let you go!And that
awful journey--two hundred miles of unknown jungle, to the far-off
Nechi!And then the burning river, to Cartagena, where--where _he_ is!And the States--God, what awaits you there!""Padre," she answered softly, "I shall not go unless it is right.If
it is right, then God will take care of me--and of you."Again she saw only the "right-best" thought, while he sat trembling
before its opposite.And the opposite was as yet a supposition!"Padre dear, there is no separation, you know.God is everywhere, and
so there is no separation from good--is there?""Not in your thought, dearest child," he murmured huskily."Well, Padre dear, I am still with you, am I not?Can't you live one
day at a time?You are borrowing from
to-morrow, and you have no right to do it.God says,
'Thou shalt not steal,' even from to-morrow."The thought seemed to
lighten his load momentarily."You have been thinking so many bad thoughts of late--I don't suppose
you have had any good thoughts at all about Anita's little babe?"You promised me that every day you
would just _know_ that."Aye, his crowning sin was revealed again in
all its ugly nakedness.His thought was always of his own
troubles, his own longings, his own fears.Self-centeredness had left
no room for thoughts of Ana's blind babe.And why was he now straining
this beautiful girl to himself?Was it fear for her, or for himself?Yet she gave but little heed to her own needs.Always her concern was
for others, others who stumbled and drooped because of the human
mind's false, unreal, undemonstrable beliefs and ignorance of the
allness of God."Ah, child," he exclaimed penitently, "such love!How could I dare to
hope ever to claim it!"Why, Padre, I love the real 'you,' the 'you' that is going to be
brought out, and that will become more and more clear, until at last
it stands as the perfect reflection of God.Haven't I told you that,
time and time again?"But--to live with me--to be my--"

"Well, Padre, if we were not still human we would not be thinking that
we were on earth.We have got to work out of this human way of
thinking and living.And it has seemed to me that you and I could work
out of it so much better together, you helping me, manifesting God's
protection and care, and I helping you, as you say I can and do.And
how can we live together and work together unless we marry?He would not try to explain her reasoning, her contempt for
convention.As for him, women had never
constituted a temptation.He knew that he loved this simple, ingenuous
girl with a tenderness of passion that was wholly free from the dross
of mesmerism."Padre, if you think you must stay here for a little while, to work
out your problem, why, I shall just _know_ that evil can not separate
us.I don't like to even seem to go away without you.But--it will be
only seeming, after all, won't it?God's children can not really be
separated--never!"She was still paying faithful tribute to her vision of the spiritual
universe.How like a benison they
flowed over his drooping spirits!"And now, Padre dear," she said, rising from the bench,--"we have done
all we could--left everything with God--haven't we?I must go now, for
madre Maria told me to come back soon.Sing
again the sweet melody that I heard when I awoke from the fever that
day long ago!"Nestling close against him, her
head resting on his shoulder and her hand in his, she sang again the
song that had seemed to lift him that distant day far, far above the
pitiful longings and strivings of poor humanity, even unto the gates
of the city of eternal harmony.She finished, and the last clear, sweet note echoed through the musty
room and died among the black rafters overhead.A holy silence fell
upon them as they sat, hand in hand, facing the future.Hot tears were
streaming down the man's cheeks.They fell sparkling like drops of
dew upon her brown curls.The girl, obedient
to the vision, was reaping her reward.He, timid, wavering, doubting,
was left, still pecking at the shell of his dreary environment.It was
but the working of the infinite law of cause and effect.But did he
imagine that out in the world she would not still find tribulation,
even as the Saviour had said?But she
leaned on her sustaining God.She had already passed through such fiery trials that
he knew no contrary belief in evil now could weaken or counterbalance
her supreme confidence in immanent good."If I have to go and leave you, will you promise me that you will act
your knowledge of the Christ-principle and work out your problem, so
that you may come to me soon?"The tug at his heartstrings brought a moan to his lips."And--you will keep your promise about Anita's babe?"She rose and, still holding his hand, led him down the hill and to
Rosendo's house.Throughout the remainder of that feverishly busy day the priest clung
to the girl like a shadow.They talked together but little, for she
was in constant demand to help her foster-mother in the preparations
for the long journey.Again and again
he would seize her hand and press it to his burning lips.Again and
again he would stroke her soft hair, or stretch out his hand to touch
her dress as she passed him.Always when she glanced up at him the
same sweet, compassionate smile glowed on her face.When she left the
house, he followed.When she bent over the ash-strewn fireplace, or
washed the few plain dishes, he sought to share her employment; and,
when gently, lovingly repulsed, sat dully, with his yearning eyes
riveted upon her.Rosendo saw him, and forgot his own sorrow in pity
for the suffering priest.The preparations carried the toilers far into the night.But at length
the last bundle was strapped to its _siete_, the last plan discussed
and agreed upon, and the two Americans had thrown themselves upon
their cots for a brief rest before dawn.Rosendo took Jose aside,
while Dona Maria and Carmen sought their beds."Fernando sends Juan to Bodega Central at daybreak," the old man said.Maria remains
here with you until I return.Then we may go to the _hacienda_ of Don
Nicolas, on the Boque.I shall tell him to have it in readiness on my
return.I shall probably not get back to Simiti for two months.If, as
you say, you still think best not to go with the Americans and the
girl, what will you do here?Some say
they intend to ask the Bishop to remove you._Bien_, will you not
decide to go?"He shook his head, and waved
Rosendo away.Then, taking a chair, he went into the sleeping room and
sat down at the bedside of the slumbering girl.Reaching over, he took
her hand.What was it that she had said to him that day, long gone, when Diego
claimed her as his child?Ah, yes:

"Don't feel badly, Padre dear.His thoughts have only the minus
sign--and that means nothing, you know."And later, many weeks later:

"Padre, you can not think wrong and right thoughts together, you know.You can not be happy and unhappy at the same time.You can not be sick
and well together."In other words, the wise little maid was trying to
show him that Paul spoke directly to such as he when he wrote: Know ye
not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants
ye are--?"You can not have both good and evil, Padre," she had so often
insisted."You must want good--want it more than anything else.And
then you must prepare for it by thinking right thoughts and unthinking
wrong ones.And as you prepare for good, you must _know_ that it is
coming.But you must not say how it shall come, nor what it shall look
like.You must not say that it shall be just as you may think you
would like to have it."You see, Padre dear"--oh, how the memory of her words smote him
now!--"you see, the good Jesus told the people to clean their
window-panes and let in the light--good thoughts--for then these would
be externalized in health, happiness, and all good, instead of the
old, bad thoughts being externalized longer in sickness and evil.He saw that the Christ-idea found expression and
reflection in the pure mentality of this girl.He saw that that
mentality was unsullied, uneducated in the lore of human belief, and
untrained to fear.He saw that the resurrection of the Christ, for
which a yearning world waits, was but the rising of the Christ-idea
in the human mentality.And he saw, too, that ere the radiant
resurrection morn can arrive there must be the crucifixion, a
world-wide crucifixion of human, carnal thought.But will ye not learn that following him means _thinking_
as he did?But Jose had tried to think aright during those years in Simiti.True,
but the efforts had been spasmodic.From childhood he had passed
through doubt, fear, scepticism, and final agnosticism.Then he had
started anew and aright.And then had come the "day of judgment," the
recurrent hours of sore trial--and he had not stood.Called upon to
prove God, to prove the validity of his splendid deductions, he had
vacillated between the opposing claims of good and evil, and had
floundered helplessly.And now he stood confronting his still unsolved
problem, realizing as never before that in the solving of it he must
unlearn the intellectual habits of a lifetime.There were other problems which lay still unsolved before him as he
sat there that night.The sable veil of mystery which hung about
Carmen's birth had never been penetrated, even slightly.What woman's
face was that which looked out so sadly from the little locket?"Dolores"--sorrowful, indeed!What tragedy had those great, mournful
eyes witnessed?He used to
think so, but not of late.Did she, he wondered, resemble the man?And
had the mother's kisses and hot tears blurred the portrait beneath
which he had so often read the single inscription, "Guillermo"?If so,
could not the portrait be cleaned?But Jose himself had not dared
attempt it.Perhaps some day that could be done by one skilled in such
art.And did Carmen inherit any of her unique traits from either of her
parents?Her voice, her religious instinct, her keen mentality--whence
came they?"From God," the girl would always answer whenever he voiced
the query in her presence.And Jose found himself sitting beside the
sleeping girl and dumbly yielding to the separation which now had
come.And, if he must live and
solve his problem, could he stand after she had left?He bent closer
to her, and listened to the gentle breathing.He seemed again to see
her, as he was wont in the years past, flitting about her diminutive
rose garden and calling to him to come and share her boundless joy."Come, Padre dear, and see my beautiful
thoughts!"And then, so often, "Oh, Padre!"bounding into his arms,
"here is a beautiful thought that came to me to-day, and I caught it
and wouldn't let it go!"Lonely, isolated child, having nothing in
common with the children of her native heath, yet dwelling ever in a
world peopled with immaculate concepts!He thought of the day when he had
approached Rosendo with his great question."Rosendo," he had said in
deep earnestness, "where, oh, where did Carmen get these ideas?"No, Padre," Rosendo had replied gravely."When she was a little
thing, just learning to talk, she often asked about God.And one day I
told her that God was everywhere--what else could I say?_Bien_, a
strange light came into her eyes.And after that, Padre, she talked
continually about Him, and to Him.And she seemed to know Him well--so
well that she saw Him in every thing and every place.Padre, it is
very strange--very strange!"No, it was not strange, Jose had thought, but beautifully natural.And
later, when he came to teach her, his constant endeavor had been to
impart his secular knowledge to the girl without endangering her
marvelous faith in her immanent God.In that he had succeeded, for in
that there had been no obstructing thoughts of self to overcome.And now--

"For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will
I gather thee--"

The night shadows fled.Jose still sat at the girl's
bedside, dumb and motionless.Carmen awoke, and threw her arms about
him.But Rosendo appeared and hurried her out to the light morning
repast, for they must lose no time in starting.By ten o'clock the savannas would be too hot to cross, and
they lay some distance from Simiti.Reed and Harris were bustling
about, assembling the packers and cracking jokes as they strapped the
chairs to the men's backs.Dona Maria's eyes were red with weeping,
but she kept silence.Don Jorge
grimly packed his own kit and prepared to set out for the Magdalena,
for he had suddenly announced his determination not to accompany
Rosendo and his party, but to go back and consult with Don Carlos
Norosi in regard to the future.At last Rosendo's voice rang out in a great shout:

"_Ya esta!"_

"Bully-bueno!"The _cargadores_ moved forward in the direction of the Boque trail.The Americans, with a final _adios_ to Dona Maria and the priest,
swung into line behind them.Rosendo again tenderly embraced his
weeping spouse, and then, turned to Jose."The Virgin watch over you and Maria, Padre!If the war comes, flee with her to the Boque."He threw an arm about the priest and kissed him on both cheeks.Then,
calling to Carmen, he turned and started after the others."Padre," she murmured, clinging to him and showering him with kisses,
"I love you, love you, love you!You
will come--or I will come back to you.And I will work for you every
day.I will know that you are God's child, and that you will solve
your problem!"Rosendo, half way down the road, turned and called sharply to her.But again she stopped, turned around, and flew
back to Jose, as he knelt in the dust and, with tongue cleaving to his
mouth, held out his trembling arms."Padre, dearest, dearest Padre," she sobbed, "I love you, I love you!And--I had forgotten--this--it is for you to read every day--every
day!"Again she tore herself
away and ran after the impatient Rosendo.In a moment they were out of
sight.A groan of anguish escaped the stricken priest.He rose from his knees
and followed stumbling after the girl.As he reached the shales he saw
her far in the distance at the mouth of the trail.She turned, and
waved her hand to him.Then the dark trail swallowed her, and he saw
her no more.For a moment he stood like a statue, striving with futile gaze to
penetrate that black opening in the dense bush that had engulfed his
very soul.His hand
closed convulsively over the paper which the girl had left with him.Mechanically he opened it and read:

  "Dearest, dearest Padre, these four little Bible verses I leave
  with you; and you will promise your little girl that you will
  always live by them.Thou shall have no other gods before me.Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
  heaven is perfect.Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."And, Padre, my dearest, dearest Padre, _God is everywhere_."His brain reeled, and he swayed like a drunken man.He
turned about, muttering incoherently.Tenderly taking his arm, she led him back to the forlorn little house.Its ghastly emptiness smote him until his reason tottered.He sank
into a chair and gazed with dull, stony eyes out over the placid
lake, where the white beams of the rising sun were breaking into
myriad colors against the brume.CHAPTER 37


The two hundred miles which lay before Rosendo and his little band
stretched their rugged, forbidding length through ragged canons,
rushing waters, and dank, virginal forest.Only the old man, as he
trudged along the worn trail between Simiti and the Inanea river,
where canoes waited to transport the travelers to the little village
of Boque, had any adequate conception of what the journey meant.Even
the _cargadores_ were unfamiliar with the region which they were to
penetrate.Some of them had been over the Guamoco trail as far as
Culata; a few had ascended the Boque river to its farthest navigable
point.But none had penetrated the inmost reaches of the great canon
through which the headwaters tumbled and roared, and none had ever
dreamed of making the passage over the great divide, the _Barra
Principal_, to the Tigui beyond.To the Americans, fresh from the luxury and convention of city life,
and imbued with the indomitable Yankee spirit of adventure, the
prospect was absorbing in its allurements.Especially to the
excitable, high-strung Harris, whose great eyes almost popped from his
head at the continuous display of tropical marvels, and whose
exclamations of astonishment and surprise, enriched from his
inexhaustible store of American slang and miner's parlance, burst from
his gaping mouth at every turn of the sinuous trail.From the outset,
he had constituted himself Carmen's special protector, although
much to Rosendo's consternation, for the lank, awkward fellow, whose
lean shoulders bent under the weight of some six-feet-two of
height, went stumbling and tripping along the way, swaying against
every tree and bush that edged the path, and constantly giving noisy
vent to his opinions regarding trails in general, and those of the
tropics in particular.His only accouterment was a Winchester
rifle of tremendous bore, which he insisted on carrying in constant
readiness to meet either beasts of prey or savage Indians, but
which, in his absent-mindedness and dreamy preoccupation, he
either dragged, muzzle up, or carried at such dangerous angles that
the natives were finally obliged, in self-protection, to insist
that he hand the weapon over to Rosendo.To Carmen, as the days
passed and she gradually recognized his sterling qualities, he
became a source of delight.Hour after hour she trotted along after
him, chatting merrily in her beloved English tongue, poking fun at
his awkwardness, and laughing boisterously over his quaint slang and
naive Yankee expressions.She had never heard such things from Jose;
nor had the priest, despite his profound knowledge, ever told her
such exciting tales as did Harris, when he drew from his store of
frontier memories and  his narratives with the rich tints
furnished by his easy imagination.The first day out had been one of mental struggle for the girl.She
had turned into the trail, after waving a last farewell to Jose, with
a feeling that she had never experienced before.For hours she trudged
along, oblivious of her environment, murmuring, "It isn't true--it
isn't true!"until Harris, his curiosity aroused by the constant
repetition which floated now and then to his ears, demanded to know
what it was that was so radically false."It isn't true that we can be separated," she answered, looking at him
with moist eyes."Yes, God's children--people--people--who--love each other," she
replied.Then she dropped her eyes in evident embarrassment, and
refused to discuss the topic further.ejaculated Harris, pondering the cryptical remark, "you
surely are a queer little dud!"But the girl turned from him to Rosendo.Nor would
she permit the old man to leave her until, late that night, exhausted
by the excitement of the day, she dropped asleep in the house of Don
Nicolas, on the muddy margin of the river Boque, still clinging to
Rosendo's hand.Despite the protestations of Don Nicolas and the pleading of the
_cargadores_, Rosendo stolidly refused to spend a day at Boque.They were still within reach of
the federal authorities.He dared not rest until the jungle had
swallowed them."Ah, _compadre_," said Don Nicolas, in disappointment, "I would like
much for you to enjoy my house while it is still clean.they swarmed down upon us but a day ago.They came out of the bush in millions, straight for the house.had we remained, we should have been eaten alive.But
they swept the house--_Hombre_!no human hands could have done so
well.Every spider, every rat, beetle, flea, every plague, was
instantly eaten, and within a half hour they had disappeared again,
and we moved back into a thoroughly cleaned house!"Harris stood with mouth agape in mute astonishment when Carmen, whom
he had constituted his interpreter, translated to him the story.That evening, after they had eaten out in the open before the house,
and the Americans had tickled the palates of the villagers with some
tinned beef of uncertain quality, Don Nicolas approached Reed."Senor," he said, "my mother, now very aged, is sick, and we think she
can not recover.But you Americanos are wonderfully skilled, and your
medicines powerful.Have you not some remedy in your pack that will
alleviate the good woman's sufferings?Reed knew how great was the faith of these simple people in the wisdom
of the American, and he had reason to wish to preserve it.But he had
come into that country illy prepared to cope with disease, and his
medical equipment contained nothing but quinine.He reflected a
moment, then turned to Harris."Did you smuggle any of your beloved root-beer extract into the
equipment?"Harris looked sheepish, but returned a sullen affirmative."Well," continued Reed, "dig out a bottle and we'll fix up a dose of
pain-killer for our worthy host's mother.""Cierto, senor," he said with an air of
confidence."I have a remedy which I know to be unfailing for any
disease."He disappeared into the house, from which he emerged again in a few
moments with an empty cola bottle.Washing this clean in the river, he
partly filled it with water.Then he poured in the small bottle of
root-beer extract which Harris handed him, and added a few grains of
quinine.Shaking the mixture thoroughly, he carried it to Don
Nicolas."Be very careful, senor," he admonished, giving him the bottle."It is
a medicine extremely powerful and immediate in its action.Give the
senora a small teaspoonful every hour.By morning you will notice a
marked change."Don Nicolas's eyes lighted with joy, and his gratitude poured forth in
extravagant expressions.With the first indications of approaching day Rosendo was abroad,
rounding up his cargadores, who were already bickering as to their
respective duties, and arranging the luggage in the canoes for the
river trip.Additional boats and men had been secured; and Don Nicolas
himself expressed his intention of accompanying them as far as his
hacienda, Maria Rosa, a day's journey up-stream."It was there that I hid during the last revolution," he said, "when
the soldiers burned the village and cut off the ears and fingers of
our women for their rings.Ah, senores, you can not know how we
suffered!All my goods stolen or burned--my family scattered--my
_finca_ destroyed!We lived two years at Maria Rosa, not daring to
come down the river again.His eyes burned fiercely as he spoke, and his hands opened
and closed convulsively.He was a representative of that large class
of _rurales_ upon whom the heaviest burdens, the greatest suffering,
and the most poignant sorrow attending a political revolution always
fall.he exclaimed, suddenly turning to Reed, "I had all but
forgotten!She would see the kind
American whose remedies are so wonderful.For, senor, she rose from
her bed this morning restored!And you must leave us another bottle of
the remedy--at whatever price, senor!"Reed gazed at the man uncomprehendingly, until at length the truth
dawned upon him.His root-beer remedy had done its work!Then a broad
grin mantled his face; but he quickly suppressed it and went with Don
Nicolas to receive in person his patient's effusive thanks.When he
returned and took his place in the waiting boat, he shook his head."It's past all understanding," he muttered to Harris, "what faith will
do!I can believe now that it will remove mountains."Throughout the long, interminably long, hot day the perspiring men
poled and paddled, urged and teased, waded and pushed against the
increasing current, until, as the shadows began to close around them,
they sighted the scarcely visible opening in the bush which marked the
trail to the _hacienda_ of Maria Rosa.It was a desperately lonely
clearing on the verge of the jungle; but there were two thatch-covered
sheds, and to the exhausted travelers it gave assurance of rest and
protection.Before they made the landing Rosendo's sharp eyes had
spied a large ant-eater and her cub, moving sluggishly through the
bush; and Reed's quick shots had brought them both down.The men's
eyes dilated when the animals were dragged into the canoes.It meant
fresh meat instead of salt _bagre_ for at least two days.Early next morning the travelers bade farewell to Don Nicolas and set
their course again up-stream.They would now see no human being other
than the members of their own little party until they reached Llano,
on the distant Nechi."Remember," called Don Nicolas, as the canoes drifted out into the
stream, "the _quebrada_ of Caracoli is the third on the right.An old
trail used to lead from there across to the Tiguicito--but I doubt if
you find even a trace of it now.There is no water between that point
and the Tiguicito._Conque, adios, senores, adios_!"The hallooing of farewells echoed along the river and died away in the
dark forest on either hand.Harris and Reed settled back in their
canoe and yielded to the fascination of the slowly shifting scene.Carmen chose to occupy the same canoe with them, and perforce Rosendo
acted as _patron_.Between his knees
Reed held the rifle upright, in readiness for any animal whose
curiosity might bring it to the water's edge to view the rare pageant
passing through that unbroken solitude.The river was now narrowing, and there were often rapids whose ascent
necessitated disembarking from the canoes, while the _bogas_ strained
and teased the lumbering dugouts up over them.In places the stream
was choked by fallen trees and tangled driftwood, until only a narrow,
tortuous opening was left, through which the waters raced like a
mill-course, making a heavy draft on the intuitive skill of the
_bogas_.Often slender islets rose from the river; and then heated,
chattering, often acrimonious discussions ensued among the men as to
the proper channel to take.Always on either side rose the matted,
tangled, impenetrable forest wall of dense bush and giant trees, from
which innumerable trailers and _bejuco_ vines dropped into the waters
beneath.From the surface of the river to the tops of the great trees,
often two hundred feet above, hung a drapery of creeping plants, of
parasitical growths, and diversified foliage, of the most vivid shades
of green, inextricably laced and interwoven, and dotted here and there
with orchideous flowers and strange blossoms, while in the tempered
sunlight which sifted through it sported gorgeous insects and
butterflies of enormous size and exquisite shades, striped and spotted
in orange, blue, and vivid red.Scarcely a hand's breadth of the
jungle wall but contained some strange, eerie animal or vegetable form
that brought expressions of wonder and astonishment from the
enraptured Americans.At times, too, there were grim tragedies being
enacted before them.In one spot a huge, hairy spider, whose delicate,
lace-like web hung to the water's edge, was viciously wrapping its
silken thread about a tiny bird that had become entangled.Again, a
shriek from beyond the river's margin told of some careless monkey or
small animal that had fallen prey to a hungry jaguar.Above the
travelers all the day swung the ubiquitous buzzards, with their
watchful, speculative eyes ever on the slowly moving cavalcade.If her thought reverted at all to the priest,
she gave no hint of it.But once, leaning back and gazing off into
the opalescent sky overhead, she murmured: "And to think, it is only
the way the human mind translates God's ideas!And some day I shall see those ideas, instead of the mortal mind's
interpretations of them!"Harris heard her, and asked her to repeat her comments in English."You would not understand," she said simply.And no
badinage on his part could further influence her.Rosendo, inscrutable and silent, showed plainly the weight of
responsibility which he felt.Only twice that day did he emerge from
the deep reserve into which he had retired; once when, in the far
distance, his keen eye espied a small deer, drinking at the water's
edge, but which, scenting the travelers, fled into cover ere Reed
could bring the rifle to his shoulders; and again, when they were upon
a jaguar almost before either they or the astonished animal realized
it.In the tempered rays of the late afternoon sun the flower-bespangled
walls of the forest became alive with gaily painted birds and insects.Troops of chattering monkeys awoke from their midday _siesta_ and
scampered noisily through the treetops over the aerial highways
formed by the liana vines, whose great bush-ropes, often a foot and
more in thickness, stretched their winding length long distances
through the forest, and bound the vegetation together in an
intricate, impenetrable network.Yellow and purple blossoms, in a
riot of ineffable splendor, bedecked the lofty trees and tangled
parasitical creepers that wrapped around them, constituting
veritable hanging gardens.Great palms, fattened by the almost
incessant rains in this hot-house of Nature, rose in the spaces
unoccupied by the buttressed roots of the forest giants.Splendidly
tailored kingfishers swooped over the water, scarce a foot above its
surface.Quarreling parrots and nagging macaws screamed their
inarticulate message to the travelers.Tiny forest gems, the
infinitely variegated _colibri_, whirred across the stream and
followed its margins until attracted by the gorgeous pendent flowers.On the _playas_ in the hazy distance ahead the travelers could often
distinguish tall, solemn cranes, dancing their grotesque measures, or
standing on one leg and dreaming away their little hour of life in
this terrestrial fairy-land.Darkness fell, almost with the swiftness of a snuffed candle.For an
hour Rosendo had been straining his eyes toward the right bank of the
river, and as he gazed his apprehension increased.But, as night
closed in, a soft murmur floated down to the cramped, toil-worn
travelers, and the old man, with a glad light in his eyes, announced
that they were approaching the _quebrada_ of Caracoli.A half hour
later, by the weird, flickering light of the candles which Reed and
Harris held out on either side, Rosendo turned the canoe into a
brawling stream, and ran its nose into the deep alluvial soil.Plunging fearlessly through the fringe of delicate ferns which lined
the margin of the creek, he cut a wide swath with his great _machete_
and uncovered a dim trail, which led to a ramshackle, thatch-covered
hut a few yards beyond.It was the tumbled vestige of a shelter which
Don Nicolas had erected years before while hunting wild pigs through
this trackless region.An hour later the little group lay asleep on
the damp ground, wrapped in the solitude of the great forest.The silvery haze of dawn was dimming the stars and deepening into
ruddier hues that tinged the fronds of the mighty trees as with
streaks of blood when Rosendo, like an implacable Nemesis, prodded his
little party into activity.Their first day's march through the
wilderness was to begin, and the old man moved with the nervous,
restless energy of a hunted jaguar.The light breakfast of coffee and
cold _arepa_ over, he dismissed the _bogas_, who were to return to
Boque with the canoes, and set about arranging the cargo in suitable
packs for the _cargadores_ who were to accompany him over the long
reaches of jungle that stretched between them and Llano.Two
_macheteros_ were sent on ahead of the main party to locate and open a
trail.Before the shimmering,
opalescent rays which overspread the eastern sky had begun to turn
downward, the little cavalcade, led by Rosendo, had taken the narrow,
newly-cut trail and plunged into the shadows of the forest--

  "the great, dim, mysterious forest, where uncertainty wavers to an
  interrogation point."CHAPTER 38


The emotion of the jungle is a direct function of human temperament.Where one sees in it naught but a "grim, green sepulcher," teeming with
malignant, destructive forces, inimical to health, to tranquillity, to
life, another--perhaps a member of the same party--will find in the
wanton extravagance of Nature, her prodigious luxury, her infinite
variety of form, of color, and sound, such stimuli to the imagination,
and such invitation to further discovery and development, as to
constitute a lure as insidious and unescapable as the habit which too
often follows the first draft of the opium's fumes.There are those
who profess to have journeyed through vast stretches of South
American _selva_ without encountering a wild animal.Others, with sight
and hearing keener, and with a sense of observation not dulled by
futile lamentations over the absence of the luxuries of civilized
travel, will uncover a wealth of experiences which feed the memory
throughout their remaining years, and mold an irresistible desire to
penetrate again those vast, teeming, baffling solitudes.It is true, the sterner aspect of the South American jungle
affords little invitation to repose or restful contemplation.And
the charm which its riotous prodigality exerts is in no sense
idyllic.For the jungle falls upon one with the force of a blow.It
grips by its massiveness, its awful grandeur.It does not entice
admiration, but exacts obeisance by brute force.Its rest is continuous motion, incessant activity.The
garniture of its trackless wastes is that of great daubs of vivid
color, laid thick upon the canvas with the knife--never modulated,
never worked into delicate shading with the brush, but attracting
by its riot, its audacity, its immensity, its disdain of convention,
its utter disregard of the canons cherished by the puny mind that
contemplates it.The forest's appeal is a reflex of its own infinite
complexity.The sensations which it arouses within the one who steps
from civilization into its very heart are myriad, and often
terrible.The instinct of self-preservation is by it suddenly,
rudely aroused and kept keenly alive.The roar of its howling monkeys strikes terror to the timid heart.The plaintive calls of its persecuted feathered denizens echo through
the mysterious vastnesses like despairing voices from a spirit
world.The crashing noises, the strange, weird, unaccountable
sounds that hurtle through its dimly lighted corridors blanch the
face and cause the hand to steal furtively toward the loosely
sheathed weapon.The piercing, frenzied screams which arise with
blood-curdling effect through the awful stillness of noonday or the
dead of night, turn the startled thought with sickening yearning
toward the soft charms of civilization, in which the sense of
protection is greater, even if actual security is frequently less.Because of Nature's utter disregard of the individual, life is
everywhere.And that life is sharply armed and on the defensive.Their droning murmur crowds the air.The trunks of trees, the
great, pendent leaves of plants, the trailing vines, slimy with dank
vegetation, afford footing and housing to countless myriads of
them, keenly alert, ferociously resistive.The decaying logs fester
with scorpions.The ground is cavernous with the burrows of
lizards and crawling forms, with centipedes and fierce formicidae.Where
one falls, countless others spring up to fill the gap.The rivers
and _pantanos_ yield their quota of variegated forms.The flat
_perania_, the dreaded electric eel, infests the warm streams, and
inflicts its torture without discrimination upon all who dare invade
its domain.Snakes lurk in the fetid swamps and lagoons, the
brilliant coral and the deadly _mapina_.Beneath the forest leaves
coils the brown adder, whose sting proves fatal within three days.To those who see only these aspects of the jungle, a journey such as
that undertaken by Rosendo and his intrepid little band would prove a
terrifying experience, a constant repetition of nerve-shocks, under
which the "centers" must ultimately give way.But to the two
Americans, fresh from the mining camps of the West, and attuned to any
pitch that Nature might strike in her marvelous symphony, the
experience was one to be taken in the same spirit as all else that
pertained to their romantic calling.Rosendo and his men accepted the
day's stint of toil and danger with dull stolidity.Carmen threw
herself upon her thought, and saw in her shifting environment only the
human mind's interpretation of its mixed concept of good and evil.The
insects swarmed around her as around the others.The tantalizing
_jejenes_ urged their insidious attacks upon her, as upon the rest.Her hands were dotted with tiny blood-blisters where the ravenous
gnats had fed.But she uttered no complaint; nor would she discuss the
matter when Harris proffered his sympathy, and showed his own red
hands."It isn't true," she would say."But you have no religion, and you
don't understand--as yet."Well, you have mighty
strange beliefs, young lady!""But not as strange and illogical as those you hold," she replied."Oh, I don't believe anything," he answered, with a shrug of his
shoulders."I'm an agnostic, you know.""There is just where you mistake, Mr."For, instead of not believing anything, you firmly believe in the
presence and power of evil.It is just those very people who boast
that they do not believe in anything who believe most thoroughly in
evil and its omnipotence and omnipresence."Yes, even the animals which she saw about her were but the human
mind's concepts of God's ideas--not real.In the
Bible allegory, or dream, the human, mortal mind names all its own
material concepts.From the rippling Tiguicito,
which they reached choking with thirst and utterly exhausted, they
dropped down again to the Boque, where they established camps and
began to prospect the Molino company's "near-mines," as Harris called
them after the first few unsuccessful attempts to get "colors" out of
the barren soil.At certain points, where there seemed a more likely
prospect, they remained for days, until the men, under Rosendo's
guidance, could sink pits to the underlying bedrock.Such work was
done with the crudest of tools--an iron bar, wooden scrapers in lieu
of shovels, and wooden _bateas_ in which the men handed the loosened
dirt up from one stage to another and out to the surface.It was slow,
torturing work.The food ran low, and they
complained.Then Harris one evening stumbled upon a tapir, just as the great
animal had forded the river and was shambling into the bush
opposite.It fell
with a broken hip, and the men finished it with their _machetes_.Its hide was nearly a half inch in thickness, and covered with
_garrapatas_--fierce, burrowing vermin, with hooked claws, which
came upon the travelers and caused them intense annoyance throughout
the remainder of the journey.Then Reed shot a deer, a delicate, big-eyed creature that had never
seen a human being and was too surprised to flee.Later, Fidel Avila
felled another with a large stone.And, finally, monkeys became so
plentiful that the men all but refused to eat them any longer.Two weeks were spent around the mouth of the Tiguicito and the Boque
canon.The little party
shouldered their packs and began the ascent of the ragged gorge.For
days they clambered up and down the jagged walls of the cut, or
skirted its densely covered margin.Twice Harris fell into the
brawling stream below, and was fished out by Rosendo, his eyes
popping, and his mouth choked with uncomplimentary opinion regarding
mountain travel in the tropics.Once, seizing a slender vine to aid
him in climbing, he gave a sudden lurch and swung out unexpectedly
over the gorge, hundreds of feet deep.Again Rosendo, who by this time
had learned to keep one eye on the ground and the other on the
irresponsible Harris, rescued him from his perilous position."Why don't you watch where you are going?""I might," sputtered Harris, "if I could keep my eyes off of you."Whereat Carmen pursed her lips and told him to reserve his compliments
for those who knew how to appraise them rightly.They camped where night overtook them, out in the open, often falling
asleep without waiting to build a fire, but eating soggy corn _arepa_
and tinned food, and drinking cold coffee left from the early morning
repast.But sometimes, when the fatigue of day was less, they would
gather about their little fire, chilled and dripping, and beg Carmen
to sing to them while they prepared supper.Then her clear voice would
ring out over the great canon and into the vast solitudes on either
hand in strange, vivid contrast to the cries and weird sounds of the
jungle; and the two Americans would sit and look at her as if they
half believed her a creature from another world.Sometimes Harris
would draw her into conversation on topics pertaining to philosophy
and religion, for he had early seen her bent and, agnostic that he
was, delighted to hear her express her views, which to him were so
childishly impossible.But as often he would voluntarily retire from
the conflict, sometimes shaking his head dubiously, sometimes
muttering his impatience with a mere child whose logic he, despite his
collegiate training, could not refute.He was as full of philosophical
theories as a nut with meat; but when she asked for proofs, for less
human belief and more demonstration, he hoisted the white flag and
retired from the field.But his admiration for the child became
sincere.And by the time
they had reached the great divide through which the Rosario fell, he
was dimly aware of a feeling toward the beautiful creature who walked
at his side day after day, sharing without complaint hardship and
fatigue that sorely taxed his own endurance, that was something more
than mere regard, and he had begun to speculate vaguely on a possible
future in which she became the central figure.At Rosario creek they left the great canon and turned into the rugged
defile which wound its tortuous course upward into the heights of the
_Barra Principal_.They were now in a region where, in Rosendo's
belief, there was not one human being in an area of a hundred square
miles.He himself was in sore doubt as to the identity of the
_quebrada_ which they were following.But it tallied with the brief
description given him by Don Nicolas.And, moreover, which was even
more important, as they began its ascent there came to him that sense
of conviction which every true son of the jungle feels when he is
following the right course.He might not say how he knew he was right;
but he followed the leading without further question.Up over the steep talus at the base of the canon wall they clambered,
up into the narrowing _arroyo_, cutting every foot of the way, for the
_macheteros_ were now no longer keeping ahead of them--the common
danger held the band united.Often they believed they discovered
traces of ancient trails.But the jealous forest had all but
obliterated them, and they could not be certain.In the higher and
drier parts of the forest, where they left the creek and followed
the beds of dead streams, slender ditches through which the water
raced in torrents during the wet season, they were set upon by
countless swarms of bees, a strange, stingless variety that covered
them in a buzzing, crawling mass, struggling and fighting for the
salt in the perspiration which exuded from the human bodies.Harris
swore he would cease to eat, for he could not take even a mouthful
of food without at the same time taking in a multitude of bees.Often, too, their _machetes_ cut into great hornet nests.Then, with
the shrill cry, "_Avispas_!"Rosendo would tear recklessly through
the matted jungle, followed by his slapping, stumbling companions,
until the maddened insects gave up the chase.Frequently they
walked into huge ant nests before they realized it, sometimes the
great _tucanderas_, so ferociously poisonous."Ah, senores,"
commented Rosendo, as he once stopped to point out the marvelous
roadway cut by these insects for miles straight through the jungle,
"in the days of the Spaniards the cruel taskmasters would often tie
the weak and sick slaves to trees in the depths of the forest and
let these great ants devour them alive!Senores, you can never know
the terrible crimes committed by the Spaniards!"murmured Harris, eying Carmen furtively.But she knew, though she voiced it not, that the Spaniard had never
known the Christ.Night was spent on the summit of the divide.Then, without further
respite, Rosendo urged the descent.Down through ravines and gullies;
over monster bowlders; waist deep through streams; down the sheer
sides of gorges on natural ladders formed by the hanging _mora_
vines; skirting cliffs by the aid of tangled and interlaced roots
of rank, wet vegetation; and then down again into river bottoms,
where the tenacious mud challenged their every step, and the streams
became an interminable morass, through which passage was possible
only by jumping from root to root, where the gnarled feeders of the
great trees projected above the bottomless ooze.The persecution
of the _jejenes_ became diabolical.At dawn and sunset the raucous
bellow of the red-roarer monkeys made the air hideous.The
flickering lights of the forest became dismally depressing.The men
grew morose and sullen.Reed and Harris quarreled with each other on
the slightest provocation.Then, to increase their misery, came the rain.It fell upon them in
the river bottoms in fierce, driving gusts; then in sheets that
blotted out the forest and wet their very souls.The mountains roared and trembled with the hideous
cannonade of thunder.The jungle-matted hills ran with the flood.An
unvaried pall of vapor hung over the steaming ground, through which
uncanny, phantasmagoric shapes peered at the struggling little band.Again the sun burst forth, and a fiery vapor seethed above the moist
earth.The reek of their damp clothing and the acrid odor of the wet
soil increased the enervation of their hard travel.Again and again
the peevish Harris accused Rosendo of having lost the way.The old man
patiently bore the abuse.Reed chided Harris, and at length quarreled
violently with him, although his own apprehension waxed continually
greater.Hour after hour she toiled along,
floundering through the bogs, fording the deeper streams on Rosendo's
broad back, whispering softly to him at times, often seizing and
pressing his great horny hand, but holding her peace.In vain at
evening, when gathered about the damp, smudging firewood, Harris would
bring up to her the causes of her flight.In vain he would accuse the
unfortunate Alcalde, the Bishop, the soldiers.Carmen refused to lend
ear to it, or to see in it anything more than a varied expression of
the human mind.She
saw, not persons, not things, but expressions of thought in the
phenomena which had combined to urge her out of her former environment
and cast her into the trackless jungle.At length, one day, when it seemed to the exhausted travelers that
human endurance could stand no more, Rosendo, who had long been
straining his ears in the direction straight ahead, announced that the
singing noise which floated to them as they descended a low hill and
plunged into a thicket of tall lush grass, undoubtedly came from the
river Tigui.Another hour of straining and plunging through the dense
growth followed; and then, with a final effort, which manifested in a
sort of frenzied rush, the little band emerged suddenly upon the east
bank of the crystal stream, glittering and shimmering in the bright
morning sun as it sang and rippled on its solitary way through the
great jungle.The men threw off their packs and sprawled full length upon the
ground."La Colorado," he said, indicating what the Americans at length made
out to be a frame house, looming above the high grass."And there,"
pointing to the north, "is _Pozo Cayman_, where the trail begins that
leads to La Libertad."That night, as they lay on the rough board floor of the house at La
Colorado, Rosendo told them the story of the misguided Frenchmen who,
years before, had penetrated this wild region, located a barren quartz
vein, then floated a company and begun developments.The soil was fertile; the undeveloped country
ceaselessly rich in every resource, the water pure and sparkling, and
abounding in fish.The climate, too, was moderate and agreeable.It
seemed to the foreigners a terrestrial paradise.It crept out of the jungle like a thief in the night.One by one the Frenchmen fell sick and died.He remained to protect the
company's property.But he, too, fell a victim to the plague.One day,
as he lay burning upon his bed, he called feebly to his one remaining
servant, the native cook, to bring him the little package of quinine.She hastened to comply; but, alas!she brought the packet of
strychnine instead, and soon he, too, had joined his companions in
that unknown country which awaits us all.The old woman fled in
terror; and the evil spirits descended upon the place.They haunt it
yet, and no man approaches it but with trembling.Reed and Harris listened to the weird story with strange sensations.The clouds above had broken, and the late moon streamed through the
night vapor, and poured through the bamboo walls of the house.The
giant frogs in the nearby creek awoke, and through the long night
croaked their mournful plaint in a weird minor cadence that seemed to
the awed Americans to voice to the shimmering moon the countless
wrongs of the primitive Indians, who, centuries before, had roamed
this marvelous land in happy freedom, until the Spaniard descended
like a dark cloud and, with rack and stake, fastened his blighting
religion upon them.A day's rest at La Colorado sufficed to revive the spirits of the
party and prepare them for the additional eight or ten hour journey
over boggy morass and steep hill to La Libertad.For this trip Rosendo
would take only the Americans and Carmen.The _cargadores_ were not to
know the nature of this expedition, which, Rosendo announced, was
undertaken that the Americans might explore for two days the region
around the upper Tigui.The men received this explanation with grunts
of satisfaction.Trembling with suppressed excitement, oblivious now of fatigue,
hunger, or hardship, Reed and Harris followed the old man that day
over the ancient, obliterated trail to the forgotten mine of Don
Ignacio de Rincon.They experienced all the sensations of those who
find themselves at last on the course that leads to buried treasure.To Harris, the romance attaching to the expedition obliterated all
other considerations.But Reed was busy with the practical end of it,
with costs, with the problems of supplies, of transportation, and
trail.Carmen saw but one vision, the man in far-off Simiti, whose
ancestor once owned the great mine which lay just ahead of them.When night fell, the four stood, silent and wondering, at the mouth of
the crumbling tunnel, where lay a rusted shovel bearing the scarce
distinguishable inscription, "I de R."*       *       *       *       *

Two weeks later a group of natives, sitting at a feast of baked
alligator tail, at the mouth of the Amaceri, near the dirty,
straggling riverine town of Llano, rose in astonishment as they saw
issuing from the clayey, wallowing Guamoco trail a staggering band of
travelers, among them two foreigners, whose clothes were in shreds and
whose beards and unkempt hair were caked with yellow mud.With them
came a young girl, lightly clad and wearing torn rope _alpargates_ on
her bare feet.From the
neighboring town floated a brawling bedlam of human voices.It was
Sunday, and the villagers were celebrating a religious _fiesta_."_Compadres_," said Rosendo, approaching the half-intoxicated group.One of the group, his mouth too full to speak, pointed in expressive
pantomime up-stream.Rosendo murmured a fervent "_Loado sea Dios_,"
and sank upon the ground."It will be down to-morrow--to-day, perhaps," gurgled another of the
rapidly recovering feasters, his eyes roving from one member to
another of the weird-looking little band.exclaimed Harris, as he squatted upon the damp ground
and mopped his muddy brow."I'm a salamander for heat, that's
certain!""Senor," said Rosendo, addressing Reed, "it would be well to pay the
men at once, for the boat may appear at any time, and it will not wait
long."While the curious group from the village crowded about and eagerly
watched the proceedings, Reed unstrapped his pack and drew out a bundle
of Colombian bills, with which he began to pay the _cargadores_,
according to the reckoning which Rosendo had kept.As the last man,
with a grunt of satisfaction, received his money, Harris exclaimed:
"And to think, one good American dollar is worth a bushel of that paper
stuff!"The words were scarcely out of his mouth when a shrill whistle came
echoing down the river.A cloud of smoke above the distant treetops
heralded the approach of the steamer.The little party had escaped a
wait of a month in the drenching heat of Llano by the narrow margin of
an hour.Rosendo hastened to Reed and drew him aside.He tried to speak, but
words failed him."I understand, my friend," he
said gently.My wife
and I will care for the girl until we hear from you.And we will keep
in touch with you, although it will take two months for a letter to
reach us and our reply to get back again to Simiti.The development
company will be formed at once.Within six months you may expect to
see the work started.It is your fortune--and the girl's.""Padre, I am coming back to you--yes?""_Cierto, chiquita_!"The old man would not permit himself to say
more.The girl had known for some time that he was not to accompany
her to the States, and that she should not see Ana in Cartagena.To
this she had at length accustomed herself.In a few minutes the lumbering boat had swung around and thrown out
its gang plank.A hurried embrace; a struggle with rushing tears;
another shriek from the boat whistle; and the Americans, with Carmen
standing mute and motionless between them, looked back at the fading
group on shore, where Rosendo's tall figure stood silhouetted
against the green background of the forest.For a moment he held his
arm extended toward them.Carmen knew, as she looked at the
great-hearted man for the last time, that his benediction was
following her--following her into that new world into which he might
not enter.*       *       *       *       *

Reed lifted the silent, wondering, big-eyed girl from the dinkey
train which pulled into Cartagena from Calamar ten days later, and
took her to the Hotel Mariana, where his anxious, fretting wife
awaited.Their boat had hung on a hidden bar in the Cauca river
for four interminable, torturing days.CHAPTER 39


On the day that Carmen arrived in Cartagena, Rosendo staggered down
the Guamoco trail into Simiti.On that same momentous day the flames
of war again flared up throughout the country.The Simiti episode, in
which the President had interfered, brought Congress to the necessity
of action.A few days of fiery debate followed; then the noxious
measure was taken from the table and hastily enacted into a law.But news travels slowly in Latin America, and some time was required
for this act of Congress to become generally known.The delay saw
Carmen through the jungle and down to the coast.There Reed lost no
time in transacting what business still remained for him in Cartagena,
and securing transportation for his party to New York.Jose, the shadow of his former self, clung pitiably to Rosendo's hand,
imploring the constant repetition of the old man's narrative.Then
came Juan, flying to the door.He had seen and talked with the
returned _cargadores_.Neither Jose nor Rosendo could
calm him.At length it seemed wise to them both to tell him that she
had gone to the States with the Americans, and would return to Simiti
no more.He gathered groups of companions about him and talked to them
excitedly.Then, evidently acting on
the advice of some cooler head, he rushed to his canoe and put off
across the lake toward the _cano_.But when he did, the town knew that he had been to Bodega Central, and
that the country was aflame with war.*       *       *       *       *

Reed's wife had not received Carmen in an amiable frame of mind."For
heaven's sake, Charles," she had cried, turning from his embrace to
look at the wondering girl who stood behind him, "what have you
here?""Oh, that," he laughingly replied, "is only a little Indian I lassoed
back in the jungle."And, leaving the girl to the not very tender
graces of his wife, he hurried out to arrange for the return voyage.At noon, when Harris appeared at Reed's room, Carmen rushed to him and
begged to be taken for a stroll through the town.Yielding to her
husband's insistence, Mrs.Reed had outfitted the girl, so that she
presented a more civilized appearance.At first Carmen had been
delighted with her new clothes.They were such, cheap as they were, as
she had never seen in Simiti.But the shoes--"Ah, senora," she
pleaded, "do not make me wear them, they are so tight!She was beginning her education in the conventions
and trammels of civilization.As Carmen and Harris stood that afternoon in the public square, while
the girl gazed enraptured at an equestrian statue of Simon Bolivar, a
ragged little urchin approached and begged them to buy an afternoon
paper.Harris humored him and bade Carmen ask him his name."Rincon," the lad answered, drawing himself up proudly."In the Calle Lozano," he replied, wondering why these people seemed
interested in him."Ask him who his father
is," suggested the latter."I do not know," replied the little fellow, shaking his head.He lives far away, up the great river, so Tia Catalina says."Come with me to your home,"
she said, taking his hand.The boy led them willingly through the winding streets to the little
upper room where, years before, he had first seen the light."Tia Catalina," he cried to the shabby woman who rose in amazement as
the visitors entered, "see, some strangers!"Carmen lost no time, but went at once to the heart of her question."The little fellow's father--he is a Rincon?And--he lives up the
great river?"The woman eyed her suspiciously for some moments without replying."Yes, senorita," he said eagerly, "in
Simiti.And his name--I am named for him--it is Jose.And I am going
to visit him some day.Tia Catalina said I should, no, Tia?"Harris fumbled in his pocket and drew out some money, which he handed
to the woman.Her eyes lighted, and a cavernous smile spread over her
wrinkled face."_Ah, gracias, senor_," she murmured, bending over his hand; "we need
it.The boy's father has sent us but little of late."Carmen's heart was fluttering wildly."Tell me," she said in a cold
voice, "the boy's father is Padre Jose de Rincon, of Simiti?We have just come from Simiti, and have seen him.We are leaving to-morrow for the States.""Yes, senorita," replied the woman in a thin, cracking voice, now
completely disarmed of her suspicion."The little fellow was born here
some seven years ago.But the good Padre has sent
us money ever since to care for him, until of late.Senorita, why is
it, think you, that he sends us so little now?""I--do--not--know," murmured Carmen abstractedly, scarce hearing the
woman.She bent over him and looked long
and wistfully into his eyes.He was a bright, handsome little fellow;
and though her heart was crushed, she took him into it.Swallowing the
lump which had come into her throat, she drew him to the window and
sat down, holding him before her."Your father--I know him--well.But--I did not
know--I never knew that he had a son.""Tia Catalina says he is a fine man," proudly answered the boy."And she wants me to be a priest, too.But I am going to be a
bull-fighter.""It is true, senorita," interposed the woman."We cannot keep him
from the _arena_ now.He hangs about it all day, and about the
slaughter-house.We can hardly drag him back to his meals.What
can we do, senorita?But," with a touch of pride as she looked at him,
"if he becomes a bull-fighter, he will be the best of them all!"Her question carried an appeal which
came from the depths of her soul."Senora, is there no doubt--no doubt
that Padre Rincon is the father of the boy?"The lad's mother died in the good Padre's
arms.She would not say positively who was the boy's father.We
thought at first--it was some one else.Marcelena insisted on it to
her dying day.But now--now we know that it was Padre Jose.And he was
sent to Simiti for it.But--ah, senorita, the little mother was so
beautiful, and so good!She--but, senorita, you are not leaving so
soon?""Yes, my good senora," she said wearily."We must
now return to the hotel.But--here is more money for the boy.And,
senora, when I reach the States I will send you money every month for
him.""Come," she said simply, "I have seen enough
of the city."*       *       *       *       *

At noon the next day a message from Bodega Central was put into the
hand of the acting-Bishop of Cartagena, as he sat in his study,
wrapped in the contemplation of certain papers before him.Hostilities
had begun along the Magdalena river the day before.The gates of
Cartagena were to be barricaded that day, for a boatload of rebels was
about to leave Barranquilla to storm the city and seize, if possible,
the customs.When he had read the message he uttered an exclamation.Had not the Sister Superior of the Convent of Our Lady reported the
arrival of the daughter of Rosendo Ariza some days before?He seized
his hat and left the room.Hastening to the Department of Police, he had a short interview with
the chief.Then that official despatched policemen to the office of
the steamship company, and to the dock.Their orders were to arrest
two Americans who were abducting a young girl.They returned a half
hour later with sheepish faces."Your Excellency," they announced to
their chief, "the vessel sailed from the port an hour ago, with the
Americans and the girl aboard."The announcement aroused in Wenceslas the fury of a tiger.Exacerbation
succeeded surprise; and that in turn gave way to a maddening thirst for
sanguinary vengeance.He hastened out and despatched a telegraphic
message to Bogota.Then he returned to his study to await its effect.Two days later a river steamer, impressed by the federal authorities,
stopped at the mouth of the Boque, and a squad of soldiers marched
over the unfrequented trail to Simiti, where they arrived as night
fell.Their orders were to take into custody the priest, Jose de
Rincon, who was accused of complicity in the recent plot to overthrow
the existing government.At the same time, on a vessel plowing its way into the North, a young
girl, awkwardly wearing her ill-fitting garments, hung over the rail
and gazed wistfully back at the Southern Cross.The tourists who saw
her heterogeneous attire laughed.But when they looked into her
beautiful, sad face their mirth died, and a tender pity stirred their
hearts.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The blanket of wet fog which had hung over the harbor with such
exasperating tenacity lifted suddenly, late in the raw fall afternoon,
and revealed to the wondering eyes of the girl who stood alone at the
rail of the _Joachim_ a confusion of mountainous shadows, studded with
myriad points of light which glittered and shimmered beneath the gray
pall.Across the heaving waters came the dull, ominous breathing of
the metropolis.Clouds of heavy, black smoke wreathed about the bay.Through it shrieking water craft darted and wriggled in endless
confusion.For two days the port of New York had been a bedlam of raw
sound, as the great sirens of the motionless vessels roared their
raucous warnings through the impenetrable veil which enveloped them.Their noise had become acute torture to the impatient tourists, and
added bewilderment to the girl.The transition from the primitive simplicity of her tropical home had
not been one of easy gradation, but a precipitate plunge.The
convulsion which ensued from the culmination of events long gathering
about little Simiti had hurled her through the forest, down the
scalding river, and out upon the tossing ocean with such swiftness
that, as she now stood at the portal of a new world, she seemed to be
wandering through the mazes of an intricate dream.During the ocean
voyage she had kept aloof from the other passengers, partly because of
embarrassment, partly because of the dull pain at her heart as she
gazed, day after day, at the two visions which floated always before
her: one, the haggard face of the priest, when she tore herself from
his arms in far-off Simiti; the other, that of the dark-faced,
white-haired old man who stood on the clayey river bank at wretched
Llano and watched her, with eager, straining eyes, until the winding
stream hid her from his earthly sight--forever.She wondered dully now
why she had left them, why she had so easily yielded to the influences
which had caused the separation.They might have fled to the jungle
and lived there in safety and seclusion.The malign influences which
beset them all in Simiti never could have reached them in the
trackless forest.And yet, she knew that had not Rosendo and Jose held
out to her, almost to the last moment, assurances of a speedy reunion,
she would not have yielded to the pressure which they had exerted, and
to the allurements of life in the wonderful country to which they had
sent her.Her embarrassment on the boat was due largely to a sense of
awkwardness in the presence of women who, to her provincial sight,
seemed visions of beauty.To be sure, the priest had often shown her
pictures of the women of the outside world, and she had some idea of
their dress.But that such a vast difference existed between the
illustrations and the actualities, she had never for a moment
imagined.Their gowns, their jewels, their coiffures held her in
open-mouthed marvel, until Mrs.Reed, herself annoyed and embarrassed,
remanded her to her cabin and bade her learn the impropriety of such
manners.Nor had the conduct of this lady throughout the voyage conduced to
Carmen's happiness.Reed showed plainly that the girl was an
awkward embarrassment to her; that she was tolerated because of
reasons which pertained solely to her husband's business; and she took
pains to impress upon her fellow-travelers that, in view of the
perplexing servant problem, this unmannered creature was being taken
to the States to be trained as a maid, though, heaven knew!the
training would be arduous, and the result uncertain.Reed, though measurably kind, gave Carmen scant attention.Harris
alone saved the girl from almost complete neglect.He walked the deck
with her, regardless of the smiles of the other passengers.He taught
her to play shuffle-board, checkers, and simple card games.He
conducted her over the boat and explained the intricate machinery and
the numberless wonders of the great craft.He sat with her out on the
deck at night and told her marvelous stories of his experiences in
frontier camps.And at the table he insisted that she occupy the seat
next to him, despite the protestations of the chief steward, who would
have placed her apart with the servants.Carmen said little, but she clung to the man with an appeal which,
though mute, he nevertheless understood.At Kingston he took her on a
drive through the town, and bought post cards for her to send back to
Jose and Rosendo.It consoled her immeasurably when he glowingly
recounted the pleasure her loved ones would experience on receiving
these cards; and thereafter the girl daily devoted hours to the
preparation of additional ones to be posted in New York.The lifting of the fog was the signal for a race among the stalled
craft to gain the harbor entrance.The enforced retention of the
vessels in the bay had resulted in much confusion in docking, and the
_Joachim_ was assigned to a pier not her own.The captain grumbled,
but had no choice.At the pier opposite there docked a huge liner from
Havre; and the two boats poured their swarming human freight into the
same shed.When the gang plank dropped, Harris took charge of Carmen,
while Reed and his wife preceded them ashore, the latter giving a
little scream of delight as she spied her sister and some friends with
a profusion of flowers awaiting her on the pier.She rushed joyfully
into their arms, while Reed hastened to his equipage with a customs
officer.But as Harris and the bewildered Carmen pushed into the great crowd in
the shed, the absent-minded man suddenly remembered that he had left a
bundle of Panama hats underneath his bunk.Dropping the girl's hand,
the impetuous fellow tore back up the gang plank and dived into the
boat.For a moment Carmen, stood in confusion, bracing herself against
the swarming multitude, and clinging tenaciously to the small,
paper-wrapped bundle which she carried.But the eager, belated crowd almost swept her off her
feet, and she turned again, drifting slowly with it toward the
distant exit.As she moved uncertainly, struggling the while to
prevent being crushed against the wall, she felt some one grasp her
hand.sounded a gentle voice close to her ear.Come, they are waiting for
us up ahead."It was a woman, comely of feature,
and strikingly well dressed.The
anxious fears of a moment before vanished.Reed and the others are waiting for us.The automobiles came for you all; but I presume the
others have gone by this time.However, you and I will follow in mine.the girl asked eagerly, as the woman forced a way for them
through the mass of humanity."Did he write to you--from Simiti?"He said
your name was--"

"Carmen," interrupted the girl, with a great surge of gladness, for
here was one woman who did not avoid her.cried Carmen, suddenly stopping as she remembered.He knows where to find the
automobiles.I will leave word with the pier-master to tell him."By this time they had wormed their way clear of the crowd and gained
the street.The woman, still retaining Carmen's hand, went directly to
a waiting automobile and pushed the unresisting girl through the open
door.Carmen had never seen a conveyance like this, and her thought
was instantly absorbed.And
then, sinking into the luxurious cushions, she fell to speculating as
to how the thing was moved.As the chauffeur reached back to close the door a policeman, who had
been eying the party since they came out of the shed, stepped up and
laid a hand on the car."Er--little girl," he said, looking in and addressing Carmen,
"_you--you know this lady, do you_?""Yes," replied Carmen, looking up confidently into the woman's smiling
face.She thought his blue uniform
and shining buttons and star gorgeously beautiful.Suspicion lurked in his eyes as
he looked at the woman and then back again at the girl."She is a little girl who came up from the South with my nephew, Mr.I
will give you my card, if you wish."The chauffeur, too, as he got out and
leisurely examined his engine, served further to disarm suspicion.The
officer raised up and removed his hand from the machine.The chauffeur
slowly mounted the box and threw on his lever.As the car moved gently
into the night the officer glanced at its number.What's a fellow going to do in a case like this, I'd like to know--go
with 'em?"Some minutes later, Harris, wild and disheveled, followed by Reed and
his party, emerged hurriedly into the street.asked the officer, planting himself in front
of Harris, and becoming vaguely apprehensive.sputtered Harris, his eyes protruding and his long arms pawing
the air."Girl--so high--funny dress--big straw hat!Aunt took her just now in an auto!"For a moment they all stood silent, big-eyed and gaping.The
girl came up from South America with me.Describe the woman--"

"Reed!"cried the policeman excitedly, his eyes lighting.cried the distracted Harris,
menacing the confused officer.Night had fallen, and a curious crowd was gathering around the
excited, noisy group.Reed quickly signaled a taxicab and hustled the
bewildered officer into it."You, Harris, get the women folks home,
and wait for me!I'll go to central with this officer and report the
case!""I'm going to visit every dance hall
and dive in this bloomin' town before I go home!And you, you blithering idiot," shaking a fist at the
officer, "you're going to lose your star for this!"Meantime, the car, in which Carmen lay deep in the soft cushions, sped
through the dusk like a fell spirit.A confused jumble of shadows flew
past, and strange, unfamiliar noises rose from the animated streets.The lights shimmered on the moist glass.The girl
ceased trying to read any meaning in it.It all fused into a blur; and
she closed her eyes and gave herself up to the novel sensations
stimulated by her first ride in a carriage propelled--she knew not
how.At length came a creaking, a soft, skidding motion, and the big car
rolled up against a curb and stopped."We are home now," said the woman softly, as she descended and again
took Carmen's hand.They hurriedly mounted the white stone steps of a
tall, gloomy building and entered a door that seemed to open
noiselessly at their approach.A glare of light burst upon the
blinking eyes of the girl.A <DW64> woman softly closed the door after
them.With a wondering glance, Carmen looked about her.In the room at
her right she caught a glimpse of women--beautiful, they seemed to
her--clad in loose, low-cut, gaily  gowns.There were men
there, too; and some one sat at a piano playing sprightly music.She
had seen pianos like that in Cartagena, and on the boat, and they had
seemed to her things bewitched.In the room at the end of the hall men
and women were dancing on a floor that seemed of polished glass.Loud
talk, laughter, and singing floated through the rooms, and the air
was warm and stuffy, heavy with perfume.The odor reminded her of the
roses in her own little garden in Simiti.It was all beautiful,
wonderful, fairy-like.But she had only a moment for this appraisal.Seizing her hand again,
the woman whisked her up the flight of stairs before them and into a
warm, light room.Then, without speaking, she went out and closed the
door, leaving the girl alone.Carmen sank into a great, upholstered rocking chair and tried to grasp
it all as she swayed dreamily back and forth.She
wondered if Harris dwelt in a place of such heavenly beauty; for he
had said that he did not live with Reed.What would the stupid people
of Simiti think could they see her now!She had never dreamed that
such marvels existed in the big world beyond her dreary, dusty, little
home town!Jose had told her much, ah, wonderful things!But how pitifully inadequate now seemed all their stories!She
still wondered what had made that carriage go in which she had come up
from the boat.Would her interest in
La Libertad suffice to buy one?She passed her hand over
the clean, white counterpane of the bed."Oh," she murmured, "how
beautiful!"She went dreamily to the bureau and took up, one by one,
the toilet articles that lay there in neat array.she
murmured, again and again.The
little figure reflected there contrasted so oddly with the gorgeously
beautiful ones she had glimpsed below that she laughed aloud.Then she
went to the window and felt of the soft curtains."It is heaven," she
murmured, facing about and sweeping the room, "just heaven!Oh, how
beautiful even the human mind can be!I never thought it, I never
thought it!"Again she sat down in the big rocker and gave herself up to the charm
of her surroundings.Her glance fell upon a vase of flowers that stood
on a table near another window.She rose and went to them, bending
over to inhale their fragrance.she exclaimed, as she
felt them crackle in her fingers.But she would learn, ere long, that they fittingly symbolized the life
of the great city in which she was now adrift.She began to wonder why the woman did not return.Were
not the Reeds anxious to know of her safe arrival?It was a ball--but so
different from the simple, artless _baile_ of her native town.Stray
snatches of music drifted into the room from the piano below.She went to the door, thinking to open
it a little and listen.She went hastily, instinctively, to a window and raised the
curtain.She remembered suddenly
that prison windows were like that.Terror's clammy hand gripped at her heart.Then she
caught herself--and laughed.she exclaimed, sinking again
into the rocker.At that moment the door opened noiselessly and a woman entered.She
was younger than the one who had met the boat.When she saw the girl
she uttered an exclamation.Carmen glanced down at her odd attire and then smiled up at the woman.The woman laughed, a sharp, unmusical laugh.The dry cosmetic
plastered thick upon her cheeks cracked.She was not beautiful like
the others, thought Carmen.Her cheeks were sunken, and her low-cut
gown revealed great, protruding collarbones."Come," she said
abruptly, "get out of those rags and into something modern."She
opened a closet door and selected a gown from a number hanging there.It was white, and there was a gay ribbon at the waist."It'll have to be pinned up," she commented to herself, holding it out
before her and regarding Carmen critically.she exclaimed, "am I to wear that?The woman returned no answer, but opened a bureau drawer and took from
it several other garments, which she threw upon a chair, together with
the dress."Into the whole lot of 'em," she said sharply, indicating the
garments."And move lively, for supper's waitin' and there'll be
callers soon--gentlemen callers," she added, smiling grimly.The woman stopped
abruptly and stood with arms akimbo, regarding the girl.Carmen gazed
up at her with a smile of happy, trustful assurance.She mentioned Simiti, Padre Jose, and Rosendo.Her
voice quavered a little; but she brightened up and concluded: "And Mr.Reed's Auntie, she met us--that is, me.Oh, isn't she a beautiful
lady!"The woman seemed to be fascinated by the child's gaze.Then, suddenly,
as if something had given way under great strain, she cried: "For
God's sake, don't look at me that way!She dropped into
a chair and continued to stare at the girl."Well, I've told you," replied Carmen."But," she continued, going
quickly to the woman and taking her hand, "you haven't told me your
name yet.And we are going to be such good friends, aren't we?And you are going to tell me all about this beautiful house, and
that wonderful carriage I came here in.Reed will take me out in it every
day!"Then, in a low voice:

"Your mother--is she living?""But my mother, my own real mother,
she died, long, long ago, on the banks of the great river.My father
left her, and she was trying to follow him.Then I was born--"

"The same old story!""I've been there,
girl, and know all about it.I followed the man--but it was my kid
that died!God, if I could have laid my hands on him!And now you have
come here--"

She stopped abruptly and swallowed hard.Carmen gently stole an arm
about her neck."It isn't true," she murmured, laying her soft cheek
against the woman's painted one."No one can desert us or harm us, for
_God is everywhere_.Padre Jose said I had a message for the people up here; and now you
are the first one I've told it to.And if we know that, why, nothing bad can ever happen to us.But you
didn't know it when your husband left you, did you?"Then she looked up into the girl's
deep, wondering eyes and checked herself."Come," she said abruptly,
rising and still holding her hand."We'll go down to supper now as you
are."Carmen's companion led her down the stairs and through the hall to a
brightly lighted room at the rear, where about a long table sat a half
dozen women.There were places for as many more, but they were
unoccupied.The cloth was white, the glass shone, the silver
sparkled.And the women, who glanced up at the girl, were clad in
gowns of such gorgeous hues as to make the child gasp in amazement.Over all hung the warm, perfumed air that she had thought so delicious
when she had first entered the house.The woman led her to a chair next to
the one she herself took.Carmen looked around for the lady who had
met her at the boat.The silence and the steady
scrutiny of the others began to embarrass her."Where--where is
Auntie?"she asked timidly, looking up at her faded attendant.One of the women, who swayed slightly
in her chair, looked up stupidly.A burst of laughter followed this remark, and Carmen sat down
in confusion.asked one of the younger women of Carmen's
attendant.Headache," was the laconic reply."She landed a queen this time, didn't she?"looking admiringly at
Carmen."Gets me, how the old girl does it!"Carmen," replied the girl timidly, looking questioningly about the
room."Carmen Ariza," the child amended, as her big, wondering eyes swept
the group."Where do you hail from,
angel-face?"The girl looked uncomprehendingly at her interlocutor."Tell them where you lived, child," said the woman called Jude in a
low voice."Simiti," replied Carmen, tears choking her words.A
burst of mirth punctuated the question."Long way from Paris, judging by the fashions."Carmen answered in a scarcely audible voice, "South America."Low exclamations of astonishment encircled the table, while the women
sat regarding the girl curiously."But," continued Carmen in a trembling voice, "where is Mrs.Her beautiful face wore
such an expression of mingled fear, uncertainty, and helplessness as
to throw a hush upon the room.she
muttered, "it's a shame!"She looked for a moment uncertainly into the
big, deep eyes of the girl, and then turned and hastily left the
room.The silence which followed was broken by a pallid, painted creature at
the end of the table."What an old devil the Madam is!One look into those eyes
would have been enough for me!""This is only a recruiting
station for the regular army.She'll go over to French Lucy's; and the
Madam will get a round price for the job.""Old Lucy'll get rich off of her!Ames owns
her house, too, doesn't he?"replied Jude, brightening under the stimulus of her
wine."He owns every house in this block, they say.The Madam rolls on the
floor and cusses for a week straight every time she pays hers.But
just the same, if you've ever noticed, the houses that Ames owns are
never raided by the coppers.Ames whacks up with the mayor and the
city hall gang and the chief of police.That means protection, and we
pay for it in high rents.But it's a lot better'n being swooped down
on by the cops every few weeks, ain't it?We know what we're expected
to pay, that way.And we never do when we keep handin' it out to the
cops."And he's got a new
collector, fellow from the Ketchim Realty Company.They're the old
man's agents now for his dive-houses.He can't get anybody else to
handle 'em, so the collector tells me.""Belle Carey's place was pulled last night, I hear," said one of the
women, pushing back her plate and lighting a cigarette."Yes," returned Jude, "and why?Cause the house is owned by
Gannette--swell guy livin' up on Riverside Drive--and he don't divvy
with the city hall.Belle don't pay no such rent as the Madam does--at
least so old Lucy tells me."The half-intoxicated woman down the table, who had stirred their
laughter a few minutes before, now roused up heavily.Caught a pippin for her once--right off
the train--jus' like this li'l hussy.Went to th' depot in a hack.Saw
th' li'l kid comin' an' pretended to faint.Li'l kid run to me an'
asked could she help.Got her to see me safe home--tee!She's
workin' f'r ol' Lucy yet, sound's a dollar."She fixed her bleared eyes upon Carmen and lapsed back into her former
state of sodden stupidity.The policeman's words at the
pier were floating confusedly through her thought.The strange talk of
these women increased the confusion.Another of the women got up hurriedly and left the table."I haven't
the nerve for another sob-scene," she commented as she went out.pleaded Carmen, turning from one to
another.Jude reached out and seized her hand tightly.Then, to Carmen:

"You are in a--a hotel," she said abruptly."Oh--then--then it was a mistake?"The girl turned her great, yearning
eyes upon the woman."Sit down, and finish
your supper," she said harshly, pulling the girl toward the chair.The maudlin woman down the table chuckled thickly.The <DW64> waitress
went quickly out and closed the door.Jude rose, still holding the
girl's hand."Come up stairs with me," she said, leading her away.commented one of the women, when the two had left the
room.But she's housekeeper, and that's part of her job.Jude took the girl into her own room and locked the door.Then she
sank wearily into a chair.she cried, "I'm sick of this--sick
of the whole thing!"It was all a
mistake, and we can go.""Why, you said this was a hotel--"

"Hotel!Carmen gazed at the excited woman with a puzzled expression on her
face."Now listen," said Jude, bracing herself, "I've got something to tell
you.For God's sake, child,
don't look at me that way!"Your face looks as if you had come down from the sky.But if you did,
and if you believe in a God, you had better pray to Him now!"I was afraid--a
little--at first.When we stop and just know that we love
everybody, and that everybody really loves us, why, we can't be afraid
any more, can we?"The woman looked up at the child in blank amazement.That
warped, twisted word conveyed no meaning to her.And God--it was only
a convenient execrative.But--what was it that looked out from that
strange girl's eyes?What
was emerging from those unfathomable depths, twining itself about her
withered heart and expanding her black, shrunken soul?Whence came
that beautiful, white life that she was going to blast?"Look here," she cried sharply, "tell me again all about yourself, and
about your friends and family down south, and what it was that the
Madam said to you!Carmen sat down at her feet, and taking her hand, went again over the
story.As the child talked, the woman's hard eyes widened, and now and
then a big tear rolled down the painted cheek.Her thought began to
stray back, far back, along the wreck-strewn path over which she
herself had come.At last in the dim haze she saw again the little New
England farm, and her father, stern, but honest and respected,
trudging behind the plow.In the cottage she saw her white-haired
mother, every lineament bespeaking her Puritan origin, hovering over
her little household like a benediction.Then night fell, swiftly as
the eagle swoops down upon its prey, and she awoke from a terrible
dream, stained, abandoned, lost--and seared with a foul oath to drag
down to her own level every innocent girl upon whom her hands might
thereafter fall!"And I have just had to know," Carmen concluded, "every minute since I
left Simiti, that God was everywhere, and that He would not let any
harm come to me.But when we really know that, why, the way _always_
opens.For that's prayer, right prayer; the kind that Jesus taught."The woman sat staring at the girl, an expression of utter blankness
upon her pallid face.Oh, yes, she had been taught to pray.Well she remembered, though the memory now cut like a knife, how she
knelt at her beautiful mother's knee and asked the good Father to
bless and protect them all, even to the beloved doll that she hugged
to her little bosom.But God had never heard her petitions, innocent
though she was.And He had let her fall, even with a prayer on her
lips, into the black pit!A loud sound of male voices and a stamping of feet rose from below.The woman sprang to the door and stood listening."It's the boys from
the college!"She turned and stood hesitant for a moment, as if striving to
formulate a plan.A look of fierce determination came into her face.She went to the bureau and took from the drawers several articles,
which she hastily thrust into the pocket of her dress."Now," she said, turning to Carmen and speaking in a low, strained
voice, "you do just as I say.And for God's sake
don't speak!"Leaving the light burning, she stepped quickly out with Carmen and
locked the door after her.Then, bidding the girl wait, she slipped
softly down the hall and locked the door of the room to which the girl
had first been taken.Laughter and music floated up from below, mingled with the clink of
glasses.The air was heavy with perfume and tobacco smoke.A door near
them opened, and a sound of voices issued.The woman pulled Carmen
into a closet until the hall was again quiet.Then she hurried on to
another door which she entered, dragging the girl with her.Groping through the darkness, she reached a
window, across which stood a hinged iron grating, secured with a
padlock.The woman fumbled among her keys and unfastened this.Swinging it wide, and opening the window beyond, she bade the girl
precede her cautiously."It's a fire-escape," she explained briefly.She reached through the
window grating and fastened the padlock; then closed the window; and
quickly descended with the girl to the ground below.Pausing a moment to get her breath, she seized Carmen's hand and crept
swiftly around the big house and into a dark alley.There she stopped
to throw over her shoulders a light shawl which she had taken from the
bureau.Their course lay through the muddy alley for several blocks.When they
emerged they were in a dimly lighted cross street.The air was chill,
and the thinly clad woman shivered.Carmen, fresh from the tropics,
felt the contrast keenly.A few moments' rapid walking down the street
brought them to a large building of yellow brick, surrounded by a high
board fence.The woman unfastened the gate and hurried up to the door,
over which, by the feeble light of the street lamp, Carmen read, "The
Little Sisters of the Poor."A black-robed woman admitted them and went to summon the Sister
Superior.Carmen marveled at her strange attire.A moment later they
were silently ushered into an adjoining room, where a tall woman,
similarly dressed, awaited them."Sister," said Jude excitedly, "here's a little kid--you got to care
for her until she finds her friends!"The Sister Superior instantly divined the status of the woman."Let
the child wait here a moment," she said, "and you come with me and
tell your story.It would be better that she should not hear."Carmen was drowsing in her
chair."She's chock full of religion," the woman was saying."But you," the Sister replied, "what will you do?"Then you will stay here until--"

"No, no!I have friends--others like myself--I will go to them.I--I
couldn't stay here--with her," nodding toward the girl."But--you will
take care of her?""Surely," returned the Sister in a calm voice.Then she turned abruptly and went swiftly out into the chill night."Come," said the Sister to Carmen, extending a hand.CHAPTER 2


Carmen was astir next morning long before the rising-bell sounded its
shrill summons through the long corridors.When she opened her eyes
she gazed at the ceiling above in perplexity.She still seemed to feel
the tossing motion of the boat, and half believed the bell to be the
call to the table, where she should again hear the cheery voice of
Harris and meet the tolerant smile of Mrs.Then a rush of
memories swept her, and her heart went down in the flood.She was
alone in a great foreign city!She turned her face to the pillow, and
for a moment a sob shook her.Then she reached under the pillow and
drew out the little Bible, which she had taken from her bundle and
placed there when the Sister left her the night before.The book fell
open to Isaiah, and she read aloud:

  "I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine
  hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the
  people, for a light of the Gentiles.""That means me," she said
firmly."Padre Jose said I had a message for the world; and now I
am to tell it to these people up here.That means, He has called me to do _right thinking_.And I am to tell these people how to think right.Suddenly her thought reverted to Cartagena, and to the sturdy little
lad who had so proudly claimed the name of Rincon.Then she burst into tears and threw herself back upon the
bed."I must think only God's thoughts,"
she said, struggling to her feet and checking her grief."If it is
right for the little boy to be his son, then I must want it to be so.I _must_ want only the right--I have _got_ to want it!And if it is
not right now, then God will make it so.It is all in His hands, and I
must not think of it any more, unless I think right thoughts."She dressed herself quickly, but did not put on the shoes."I simply
can not wear these things," she mourned, looking at them dubiously;
"and I do not believe the woman will make me.I wonder why the other
woman called her Sister.Why did she wear that ugly black bonnet?And
why was I hurried away from that hotel?It was so much pleasanter
there, so bright and warm; and here it is so cold."She shivered as
she buttoned her thin dress."But," she continued, "I have got to go
out now and find Mr.Harris--I have just _got_ to find
them--and to-day!But, oh, this city is so much larger than Simiti!"She shook her head in perplexity as she put the Bible back again in
the bundle, where lay the title papers to La Libertad and her mother's
little locket, which Rosendo had given her that last morning in
Simiti.The latter she drew out and regarded wistfully for some
moments."I haven't any father or mother but God," she murmured."But
He is both father and mother to me now."With a little sigh she tied
up the bundle again.Holding it in one hand and carrying the much
despised shoes in the other, she left the cheerless room and started
down the long, cold hall.When she reached the stairway leading to the floor below she stopped
abruptly."I have been
thinking only of myself.What is it that the Bible says?--'And I will bring them by a way
that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not
known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things
straight.'And Padre Jose said he would
remember it, too."Again she choked back the tears which surged up at the remembrance of
the priest, and, bracing herself, hastily descended the stairs,
murmuring at every step, "God is everywhere--right here!"At the far end of the lower hall she saw, through an open door, a
number of elderly people sitting at long tables.When she reached the door, she stopped and peered
curiously within.A murmur of astonishment rose from the inmates
when they caught sight of the quaint object in the doorway, standing
uncertainly, with her shoes in one hand, the awkwardly tied bundle in
the other, and garbed in the chaotic attire so hastily procured for
her in Cartagena.A Sister came quickly forward and, taking the girl's hand, led her
into a smaller adjoining room, where sat the Sister Superior at
breakfast.The latter greeted the child gently and bade her be seated
at the table.Carmen dropped into a chair and sat staring in naive
wonder."Well," began the Sister at length, "eat your breakfast quickly.This
is Sunday, you know, and Mass will be said in the chapel in half an
hour.But you are with friends
here, little girl.Carmen quickly recovered her spirits, and her nimble tongue its wonted
flexibility.Without further invitation or preface she entered at once
upon a lively description of her wonderful journey through the jungle,
the subsequent ocean voyage, and the mishap at the pier, and concluded
with the cryptical remark: "And, you know, Senora, it is all just as
Padre Jose said, only a series of states of consciousness, after
all!"The Sister stared blankly at the beaming child.What manner of being
was this that had been so strangely wafted into these sacred precincts
on the night breeze!The abandoned woman who had brought her there,
the Sister remembered, had dropped an equally cryptical remark--"She's
chock full of religion."But gratitude quickly mastered her wonder, and the woman, pondering
the child's dramatic recital, murmured a sincere, "The Virgin be
praised!""Oh," said Carmen, looking up quickly as she caught the words, "you
people up here talk just like those in Simiti.But Padre Jose said you
didn't know, either.You ought to, though, for you have had so many
more ad--advantages than we have.Senora, there are many big, clumsy
words in the English language, aren't there?We used to speak it all the time during the
last years we were together.He said it seemed easier to talk about
God in that language than in any other."And who is this
Jose that you talk so much about?""He--taught me--in Simiti."Well," replied the Sister warmly, "he seems to have taught you queer
things!"returned Carmen quickly, "he just taught me the truth.He
didn't tell me about the queer things in the world, for he said they
were not real."Again the Sister stared at the girl in dumb amazement.But the child's
thought had strayed to other topics.she
exclaimed, shivering and drawing her dress about her."I guess I'll
have to put on these shoes to keep my feet warm.""Didn't you
wear shoes in your country?""No," replied Carmen, tugging and straining at the shoes; "I didn't
wear much of anything, it was so warm.Oh, it is beautiful down there,
Senora, so beautiful and warm in Simiti!"She sighed, and her eyes
filled with tears.But she brushed them away and smiled bravely up at
the Sister."I've come here because it is right," she said with a firm
nod of her head."Padre Jose said I had a message for you.He said you
didn't know much about God up here.Why, I don't know much of anything
else!"She laughed a happy little laugh as she said this.Then she
went on briskly:

"You know, Senora, Padre Jose isn't really a priest.But he said he
had to stay in the Church in order to teach me.I am sure he just thought wrong about it.But, anyway,
he will not have to be a priest any more, now that I have gone, will
he?You know, Don Jorge said priests were a bad lot; but that isn't
so, for there are many good priests, aren't there?Why, Senora," she exclaimed,
suddenly remembering the Sister's previous injunction, "is this a
church?You said there would be Mass in the chapel--"

"No," replied the Sister, still studying the girl attentively, while
her manner became more severe; "this is a home for old people, a
charitable institution.""Oh," replied Carmen, with a very vague idea of what that meant."Well," her face alight and her eyes dancing, "I don't belong here
then, do I?I am never going to be old," she meditated.The Bible says we
are made in His image and likeness.Well, if that is so, how can we
ever grow old?Just think of God hobbling around in heaven with a cane
and saying: 'Well, I'm getting old now!We wouldn't grow old and die if it wasn't for our wrong
way of thinking, would we?When we think His thoughts, why, we will be
like Him.Padre Jose says this, and he knows it is
true--only, he seems to have a hard time proving it.But, Senora, we
have all got to prove it, some time, every one of us.And then there
will not be any places like this for old people--people who still
believe that two and two are seven, you know.The woman looked at her blankly; but the girl rambled on."Padre Jose
sometimes talked of the charitable institutions out in the world, and
he always said that charity was a crime against the people.And he was
right, for that is just the way Jesus looked at it, isn't it?Jesus
did not give money to beggars, but he did better, he healed them of
the bad state of mind that was making them poor and sick.Jesus, when he taught,
first said a thing, and then he turned right around and proved it.And, why, Senora,
I've had thousands of proofs!"The Sister did not reply; and Carmen, stealing a covert glance at her,
continued:

"You know, Senora, it is just as wicked to be sick and poor as it is
to tell a lie, because being sick and poor is just the ex--the
ex-ter-nal-i-zation of our thought; and such thought is not from God;
and so to hold such thoughts and to believe them real is to believe in
power apart from God.It is having other gods than the one God; and
that is breaking the very first Commandment, isn't it?Yes, it is; and
you can prove it, just as you can prove the principles in mathematics.Senora, do you know anything about mathematics?"The astonished woman made an involuntary sign of negation."Oh, Senora," cried the enthusiastic girl, "the things that Jesus
taught can be proved just as easily as we prove the rules in
mathematics!for they are truth, and all truth can be
demonstrated, you know.You know, Senora, God is everywhere--not only
in heaven, but right here where we are.Heaven, Padre Jose used to say
so often, is only a perfect state of mind; and so it is, isn't it?And when we reflect Him perfectly, why, we
will be in heaven.But," she went on after catching
her breath, "we can't reflect Him as long as we believe evil to be
real and powerful.It is just zero, nothing--"

"I've heard that before," interrupted the woman, recovering somewhat
from her surprise."But I think that before you get out of New York
you will reverse that idea.There's a pretty fair amount of evil here,
and it is quite real, we find.""If it is real, then God made it.It
seems real to you--but that is only because you give it reality in
your consciousness.You believe it real, and so it becomes to you.""Well," said the woman dryly, "on that basis I think the same may be
said of good, too.""No," answered Carmen eagerly, "good is--"

"There," interrupted the Sister coldly, holding up an admonitory hand,
"we are not going to discuss the foolish theological notions which
that fallen priest put into your poor little head.The child looked at the woman in mute protest.It was a new thought, and
one that she would not accept."Senora," she began again, after a brief interval, "Padre Jose is a
good man, even the human Padre Jose.And he is trying to solve his
problem and know God.And he is trying to know himself, not as other
people think they know him, but as God knows him, and as I have always
tried to know him.You have no right to judge him--and, anyway, you
are not judging him, but only your wrong idea of him.And that," she
said softly, "is nothing."She was beginning to feel the spell of
those great brown eyes, that soft, rich voice, and the sparkling
expression of innocence, purity, and calm assurance that bubbled from
those red lips.And she was losing herself in contemplation of the
girl's luxuriant beauty, whose rich profusion her strange, foreign
attire could not disguise."Senora," said Carmen suddenly, "the people on the boat laughed at my
clothes.But I don't think them half as funny as that great black
bonnet you are wearing.I never saw one until I
was brought here."It was said innocently, and with no thought of offense.But the woman
instantly roused from her meditation and assumed an attitude of
severe dignity."And
remember after this that children's manners here are not those of your
country."The girl fell quiet under the rebuke, and the meal ended in silence.As they were rising from the table a cheery voice came from the outer
room, and presently a priest looked in."Good morning, Sister," he cried heartily.He was a young man, apparently still in the
twenties, of athletic build, inclined rather to stoutness, and with a
round, shining face that radiated health and good nature."It is a little
waif," she said in answer to his query, "who strayed in here last
night.""Aha," said the priest, "another derelict!And will you send her to
the orphanage?""I'm afraid if I do the little heretic will corrupt all the other
children," replied the Sister."Father," she continued seriously, "I
want you to examine this child, and then tell me what you think should
be done with her.""No," replied the Sister; "but another priest has gone wrong, and
this," pointing to Carmen, "is the result of his pernicious
teachings.""Very well, Sister," he said in a low voice."I will talk with her
after the service."He seemed suddenly to have lost his cheerfulness,
as he continued to converse with the woman on matters pertaining to
the institution.Carmen, wondering and receptive, took the place assigned to her in the
chapel and sat quietly through the service.She had often seen Jose
celebrate Mass in the rude little church in Simiti, but with no such
elaboration as she witnessed here.Once or twice she joined in the
responses, not with any thought of worship, but rather to give vent,
even if slight, to the impelling desire to hear her own musical voice.She thought as she did so that the priest looked in her direction.She
thought others looked at her attentively at the same time.But they
had all stared at her, for that matter, and she had felt confused and
embarrassed under their searching scrutiny.Yet the old people
attracted her peculiarly.Never had she seen so many at one time.And
never, she thought, had she seen such physical decrepitude and
helplessness.And then she fell to wondering what they were all there
for, and what they got out of the service.Did they believe that thereby their sins were atoned?Did
they believe that that priest was really changing the wafer and wine
into flesh and blood?She recalled much that Jose had told her about
the people up in the States.They were not so different, mentally,
from her own, after all.The people, still gossiping cheerfully,
had prostrated themselves before it.The sermon had been short, for
the old people waxed impatient at long discourses.Then the priest
descended from the pulpit and came to Carmen."Now, little girl," he
said, seating himself beside her, "tell me all about yourself, who you
are, where you come from, and what you have been taught.Carmen smiled up at him; then plunged into
her narrative.It was two hours later when the Sister Superior looked in and saw the
priest and girl still sitting in earnest conversation."But," she heard the priest say, "you tell me that this
Father Jose taught you these things?""He taught me English, and French, and German.And he taught me all I know of history, and of the
world," the girl replied."Yes, yes," the priest went on hurriedly; "but these other things,
these religious and philosophical notions, who taught you these?"The Sister drew closer and strained her ears to hear.The girl looked down as she answered softly, "God."He reached out and laid a hand
on hers."I believe you," he said, in a voice scarcely audible."I
believe you--for we do not teach such things.""Then," she said quizzically,
"you are not really a priest."The Sister's voice rang sternly through the quiet
chapel."The dinner-bell
will ring in a few minutes," continued the Sister, regarding the man
severely."Ah, true," he murmured, hastily glancing at the clock."The time
passed so rapidly--a--a--this girl--"

"Leave the girl to me," replied the Sister coldly."Unless," she
added, "you consider her deranged.Coming from that hot country
suddenly into this cold climate might--"

"No, no," interrupted the priest hastily; "she seems uncommonly strong
mentally.She has some notions that are a--somewhat different from
ours--that is--but I will come and have a further talk with her."He raised his hand in silent benediction, while the Sister bowed her
head stiffly.Then, as if loath to take his eyes from the girl, he
turned and went slowly out.Carmen followed her out into the hall
and down a flight of steps to the kitchen below."Katherine," said the Sister Superior, addressing an elderly,
white-haired Sister who seemed to be in charge of the culinary
department, "put this girl to work.Let her eat with you and sleep in
your room.And see if you can't work some of the foolish notions out
of her head."CHAPTER 3


"Get some o' th' foolish notions out of your head, is it?Och, puir
bairn, wid yer swate face an' that hivenly hair, it's welcome ye air
to yer notions!Ye have talked too brash to the Sister
Superior.But, mind your tongue,
honey.Tell your funny notions to old Katie, an' they'll be safe as
the soul of Saint Patrick; but keep mum before the others, honey.""But, Senora, don't they want to know the truth up here?"There was a
note of appeal in the quavering voice."Now listen, honey; don't call me sich heathen names.I'm no Senora, whativer that may be.And as for wantin' to know the
truth, God bless ye, honey!"They don't, Sen--Sister!""Well, thin, they don't--an' mebby I'm not so far from agreein' wid
ye.But, och, it's dead beat I am, after the Sunday's work!But ye air
a right smart little helper, honey--only, ye don't belong in th'
kitchen.""Sen--I mean, Sister--"

"That's better, honey; ye'll get it in time.""Sister, I've just _got_ to find Mr."No, honey, it's few I know outside these walls.But ye can put up a
bit of a prayer when ye turn in to-night.An' we'd best be makin' for
th' bed, too, darlin', for we've a hard day's work to-morrow."It was Carmen's second night in New York, and as the girl silently
followed the puffing old woman up the several long, dark flights of
stairs to the little, cheerless room under the eaves, it seemed to her
that her brain must fly apart with the pressure of its mental
accumulation.The great building in which she was now sheltered, the
kitchen, with its marvels of equipment, gas stoves, electric lights,
annunciators, and a thousand other equally wonderful appliances which
the human mind has developed for its service and comfort, held her
fascinated, despite her situation, while she swelled with questions
she dared not ask.Notwithstanding the anxiety which she had not
wholly suppressed, her curiosity, naive, eager, and insatiable, rose
mountain high.Sister Katherine had been kind to her, had received her
with open arms, and given her light tasks to perform.And many times
during the long afternoon the old woman had relaxed entirely from her
assumed brusqueness and stooped to lay a large, red hand gently upon
the brown curls, or to imprint a resounding kiss upon the flushed
cheek.Now, as night was settling down over the great, roaring city,
the woman took the homeless waif into her big heart and wrapped her in
a love that, roughly expressed, was yet none the less tender and
sincere."Ye can ask the Virgin, honey, to send ye to yer frinds," said the
woman, as they sat in the gloaming before the window and looked out
over the kindling lights of the city."Not much, I guess, honey," answered the woman frankly."Troth, an'
I've asked her fer iverything in my time, from diamonds to a husband,
an' she landed me in a convint!"You didn't ask in the right way, Sister--"

"Faith, I asked in ivery way I knew how!An' whin I had th' carbuncle
on me neck I yelled at her!Sure she may have answered me prayer, fer
th' whoop I gave busted the carbuncle, an' I got well.Ye nivir kin
tell, honey."But, Sis--I can't call you Sister!"pleaded the girl, going to the
woman and twining her arms about her neck."Och, honey darlin'"--tears started from the old woman's eyes and
rolled down her wrinkled cheeks--"honey darlin', call me Katie, just
old Katie.Och, Holy Virgin, if I could have had a home, an' a
beautiful daughter like you--!"She clasped the girl in her great arms
and held her tightly."Katie, when you pray you must pray knowing that God has already given
you what you need, and that there is nothing that can keep you from
seeing it.""An' so, darlin', if I want
diamonds I must know that I have 'em, is it that, honey?"murmured Carmen, drawing closer, and laying her soft
cheek against the leathery visage of the old woman."Say that again, honey--och, say it again!It's words, darlin', that's
nivir been said to old Katie!""Why, hasn't any one ever been kind to you?"Och, ivirybody's kind to me, honey!But nobody has ivir loved
me--that way.The good Lord made me a fright, honey--ain't ye noticed?An' they told me from th' cradle up I'd nivir
land a man.An' I didn't, honey; they all ran from me--an' so I become
a bride o' th' Church."But, Katie, the face is nothing.Why, your heart is as big--as big as
the whole world!I hadn't been with you an hour before I knew that."Och, darlin'," murmured the woman, "sure th' Virgin be praised fer
sendin' ye to me, a lonely old woman!""It was not the Virgin, Katie, but God who brought me here," said the
girl gently, as she caressed the old Sister's cheek."It's all one, honey; the Virgin's th' Mother o' God.""Troth, child, she has th' same power as God!Don't we pray to her,
an' she prays to th' good God to save us?There is no person or thing that persuades God to be
good to His children.He is
infinite--infinite mind, Katie, and infinite good.Oh, Katie, what
awful things are taught in this world as truth!How little we know of
the great God!And yet how much people pretend they know about Him!But if they only knew--really _knew_, as Jesus did--why, Katie, there
wouldn't be an old person, or a sick or unhappy one in the whole
world!Katie," after a little pause, "I know."Air these more o' yer funny
notions, darlin'?""I suppose they are what the world thinks funny, Katie," answered the
girl.But then,
th' world moves, girlie--even old Katie sees that.Only, the Church
don't move with it.An' old Katie can see that, too.An' so, I'm
thinkin', does Father Waite.""Faith, an' how do ye know it, child?""He talked with me--a long time, this morning.He said God had taught
me what I know."Thin me own suspicions air right; he's out o' tune!Did ye say, girlie dear, that he didn't scold ye fer yer funny
notions?""No, Katie, he said they were right."Thin, lassie dear, things is goin' to happen.An' he's a
good man--troth, they make no better in this world!"Carmen looked out wonderingly over
the city.She yearned to know what it held for her."Katie," she said at length, bending again over the woman, "will you
help me find Mr."Och, lassie--what's your name again?""Carmen," replied the girl, "Carmen Ariza.""Cair-men Aree--now ain't that a name fer ye!An' I'm Scotch-Irish, honey; an' we're both a long
way from th' ol' sod!Lassie dear, tell me about last night.But, no;
begin 'way back.Old Katie's weak in th' head,
girlie, but she may see a way out fer ye.Th' Virgin help ye, puir
bairn!"Midnight boomed from the bell in a neighboring tower when Carmen
finished her story.exclaimed the old Sister, staring at the girl
in amazement."Now do ye let me feel of ye to see that ye air human;
fer only a Saint could go through all that an' live to tell it!An'
the place ye were in last night!Now be Saint Patrick, if I was rich
I'd have Masses said every day fer that Jude who brung ye here!Don't
tell me th' good Lord won't forgive her!"She's a good woman, Katie; and, somehow, I felt sorry for her, but I
don't know why.She has a beautiful home in that hotel--"

"Hotel, is it!But--och, sure, it was a hotel, honey.Only, ye air better off here wi' old Katie."But--unless it's wi' Father
Waite, I don't know what I can do.Ye air in bad with th' Sister
Superior fer yer talk at th' breakfast table.Ye're a fresh little
heathen, honey.An' she's suspicious of Father Waite, too.An' he th' best man on airth!But his doctrine ain't just sound,
sweatheart.There,
honey, lave it to me.But it's got to be done quick, or th' Sister
Superior'll have ye in an orphan asylum, where ye'll stay till ye air
soused in th' doctrine!I can manage to get word to Father Waite
to-morrow, airly.A bit of a word wi'
him'll fix it, lassie dear.An' now, honey swate, off with them funny
clothes and plump into bed.it's all but marnin' now!"A few minutes later the woman turned to the girl who lay so quiet at
her side."Honey," she whispered, "was ye tellin' me awhile back that ye knew
the right way to pray?""Yes, Katie dear," the child murmured."Thin do you pray, lass, an' I'll not trouble the Virgin this night."*       *       *       *       *

"Well, Father, what do you think now?"The Sister Superior looked up
aggressively, as Father Waite slowly entered the room.His head was
bowed, and there was a look of deep earnestness upon his face."I have talked with her again--an hour, or more," he said reflectively."She is a--a remarkable girl, in many ways.""She attracts and repels me, both," she
said.And she appears to be
suffering from religious dementia.It was a compromising question, and the priest weighed his words
carefully before replying."She does--seem to--to have rather--a--rather
unusual--religious views," said he slowly."Would it not be well to have Dr."That we may know what to do with her.If she is mentally unsound she
must not be sent to the orphanage.""She should be taken--a--I mean, we should try to locate her friends.I have already searched the city directory; but, though there are many
Reeds, there are none listed with the initials she gave me as his.I
had thought," he continued hesitatingly, "I had thought of putting her
in charge of the Young Women's Christian Association--"

"Father Waite!"The Sister Superior rose and drew herself up to her
full height."Do you mean to say that you have contemplated delivering
her into the hands of heretics?"she demanded coldly, her tall figure
instinct with the mortal pride of religious superiority."Why, Sister," returned the priest with embarrassment, "would it not
be wise to place her among those whose views harmonize more closely
with hers than ours do?"urged the man, with a gesture of
impatience.The combined weight of all the
centuries of church authority could not make her one--never!I must
take her to those with whom she rightfully belongs."The Sister Superior's eyes narrowed and glittered, and her face grew
dark.I am in charge here, and I
shall report this case to the Bishop!"The futility of his case
seemed to impress him.Taking up his hat, he bowed without speaking
and went out.Outside
the door the man listened until he caught the number she called.His
face grew dark and angry, and his hands clenched a she strode down the
hall.On the stairs that led up from the kitchen stood Sister Katherine."Wait on th' corner--behind the church!The lassie will meet you
there!"Before he could reply the woman had plunged again into the dark
stairway.Stopping at a small closet below, she took out a bundle.Then she hurried to the kitchen and summoned Carmen, who was sitting
at a table peeling potatoes."Troth, lazy lass," she commanded sharply, "do you take the bucket and
mop and begin on the front steps.And mind that ye don't bring me
heavy hand down on ye!Och, lassie darlin'," she added, when she had
drawn the startled girl out of hearing of the others, "give yer old
Katie a kiss, and then be off!Troth, it breaks me heart to see ye
go--but 'twould break yours to stay!Go, lassie darlin', an' don't
fergit old Katie!Here," thrusting the girl's bundle and a dollar bill
into her hands, "an' God bless ye, lass!Ye've won me, heart an' soul!Ye'll find a frind at th' nixt corner!"She
strained the girl again to her breast, then opened the door and
hastily thrust her out into the street.For a moment Carmen stood dazed by the suddenness of it all.She
looked up confusedly at the great, yellow building from which she had
been ejected.Then, grasping her
bundle and the dollar bill, she hurried out through the gate and
started up the street.The man's face was furrowed, and
his body trembled.The girl went up to him with a glad smile.The
priest looked up, and muttered something incoherent under his breath a
she took her hand.He drew some loose change from his pocket, and hailed an approaching
street car."To police headquarters," he replied, "to ask them to help us find
your friends."CHAPTER 4


From the mysterious wastes which lie far out on the ocean, the fog was
again creeping stealthily across the bay and into the throbbing
arteries of the great city.Through half-opened doors and windows it
rolled like smoke, and piled like drifted snow against the mountains
of brick and stone.Caught for a moment on a transient breeze, it
swirled around a towering pile on lower Broadway, and eddied up to the
windows of the Ketchim Realty Company, where it sifted through the
chinks in the loose frames and settled like a pall over the dingy
rooms within.To Philip O. Ketchim, junior member of the firm, it seemed a fitting
external expression of the heavy gloom within his soul.Crumpled into
the chair at the broad table in his private office, with his long,
thin legs stretched out before him, his hands crammed into the pockets
of his trousers, and his bullet-shaped head sunk on his flat chest,
until it seemed as if the hooked nose which graced his hawk-like
visage must be penetrating his breast-bone, the man was the embodiment
of utter dejection.On the littered table, where he had just tossed
it, lay the report of Reed and Harris on the pseudo-mineral properties
of the Molino Company--the "near-mines" in the rocky canon of the
far-off Boque.Near it lay the current number of a Presbyterian
review, wherein the merits of this now moribund project were
advertised in terms whose glitter had attracted swarms of eager,
trusting investors.The firm name of Ketchim Realty Company was something of a misnomer.The company itself was an experiment, whose end had not justified its
inception.It had been launched a few years previously by Douglass
Ketchim to provide business careers for his two sons, James and
Philip.The old gentleman, still hale and vigorous, was one of those
sturdy Englishmen who had caught the infection of '49 and abruptly
severed the ties which bound them to their Kentish homes for the
allurements of the newly discovered El Dorado of western America.Across the death-haunted Isthmus of Panama and up the inhospitable
Pacific coast the indomitable spirit of the young adventurer drove
him, until he reached the golden sands of California.There he toiled
for many years, until Fortune at length smiled upon his quenchless
efforts.Then he tossed aside his rough tools and set out for the less
constricted fields of the East.He invested his money wisely, and in the course of years turned it
several times.He aspired to the hand of a
sister of a railway president, and won it.He educated his sons in the
best colleges of the East, and then sent them to Europe on their
honeymoons.And finally, when the burden of years began to press
noticeably, and the game became less attractive, he retired from
the field of business, cleared off his indebtedness, organized the
Ketchim Realty Company, put its affairs on the best possible basis,
and then committed the unpardonable folly of turning it over to the
unrestricted management of his two sons.At the expiration of a year the old gentleman
hurried back into the harness to save the remnant of his fortune, only
to find it inextricably tied up in lands of dubious value and
questionable promotional schemes.The untangling of the real estate he
immediately took into his own hands.A word in passing regarding these sons, for they typify a form of
parasitical growth, of the fungus variety, which in these days has
battened and waxed noxious on the great stalk of legitimate commercial
enterprise.They were as dissimilar, and each as unlike his father, as
is possible among members of the same family.Both sought, with
diligent consecration, the same goal, money; but employed wholly
different means to gain that end.James, the elder, was a man of ready
wit, a nimble tongue, and a manner which, on occasions when he could
think of any one but himself, was affable and gracious.He was a
scoffer of religion, an open foe of business scruple, and the avowed
champion of every sort of artifice and device employed in ancient,
mediaeval, or modern finance to further his own selfish desires, in
the minimum of time, and at whatever cost to his fellow-man.In his
cups he was a witty, though arrogant, braggart.In his home he was
petulant and childish.Of real business acumen and constructive
wisdom, he had none.He would hew his way to wealth, if need be,
openly defiant of God, man, or the devil.Or he would work in subtler
ways, through deceit, jugglery, or veiled bribe.But he generally wore
his heart on his sleeve; and those who perforce had business relations
with him soon discovered that, though utterly unscrupulous, his
character was continuously revealed through his small conceit, which
caused him so to work as to be seen of men and gain their cheap
plaudits for his sharp, mendacious practices.Philip retained a degree of his father's confidence--which James
wholly lacked--and he spared himself no pains to cultivate it.Though
far less ready of wit than his stubby, bombastic brother, he was a
tenacious plodder, and was for this reason much more likely ultimately
to achieve his sordid purposes.His energy was tireless, and he never
admitted defeat.He never worked openly; he never appeared to have a
decided line of conduct; and no one could ever say what particular
course he intended to pursue.Apparently, he was a man of exemplary
habits; and his mild boast that he knew not the taste of tobacco or
liquor could not be refuted.He was an elder in the Presbyterian
church in the little suburb where he lived, and superintendent of its
Sunday school.His prayers were beautiful expressions of reverent
piety; and his conversation, at all times chaste and modest, announced
him a man of more than ordinary purity of thought and motive.While it
is true that no one could recall any pious deed, any charitable act,
or any conduct based on motives of self-abnegation and brotherly love
performed by him, yet no one could ever point to a single coarse or
mean action emanating from the man.If there was discord in company
affairs, the wanton James always bore the onus.And because of this,
relations between the brothers gradually assumed a condition of
strain, until at length James openly and angrily denounced Philip as a
hypocrite, and refused longer to work with him.Thereupon the milder
Philip offered the other cheek and installed a mediator, in the person
of one Rawlins, a sickly, emaciated, bearded, but loyal Hermes, who
thenceforth performed the multifold functions of pacificator,
go-between, human telephone, and bearer of messages, documents, and
what-not from one to the other for a nominal wage and the crumbs that
dropped from the promoter's table.The fog and the gloom thickened, and Ketchim sat deeply immersed in
both.He was still shaking from the fright which he had received that
morning.On opening the door as he was about to leave his house to
take the train to the city, he had confronted two bulky policemen.With a muffled shriek he had slammed the door in their astonished
faces and darted back into the house, his heart in his throat and
hammering madly.How could he know that they were only selling tickets
to a Policemen's Ball?Then he had crept to the window and, concealed
in the folds of the curtain, had watched them go down the street,
laughing and turning often to glance back at the house that held such
a queer-mannered inmate.Rousing himself from the gloomy revery into which he had lapsed,
Ketchim switched on the light and took up again the report of Reed
and Harris.Sullenly he turned its pages, while the sallow skin on his
low forehead wrinkled, and his bird-like face drew into ugly
contortions."Didn't they see that clause in their contract,
providing an additional fifty thousand in stock for them in case they
made a favorable report?"A light tap at the door, and a low cough, preceded the noiseless
entrance of the meek-souled Rawlins."A--a--this is the list which Reverend Jurges sent us--names and
addresses of his congregation.I've mailed them all descriptive
matter; and I wrote Mr.Jurges that the price of his stock would be
five dollars, but that we couldn't sell to his congregation for less
than seven.I told him Molino stock would go
up to par next month."How much stock did Jurges say he'd take?"demanded Ketchim, without
looking up."Why, he said he could only get together two thousand dollars at
present, but that later he would have some endowment insurance falling
due--"

"How soon?""About a year, I think he said.""Well, he ought to be able to borrow on that."Do so--but only hint at it.And tell him to send his check at once
for the stock he has agreed to take.""Why, he sent that some days ago.I thought you--"

"He did?"cried Ketchim, his interest now fully aroused."Er--your brother James received the letter, and I believe he put the
check in his pocket."Ketchim gave vent to a snort of rage."You tell James," he cried,
pounding the desk with his fist, "that as president and treasurer of
the Molino Company I demand that check!""Yes, sir--and--"

"Well?"Cass 'phoned before you got down this morning.He said the bank
refused to extend the time on your note."Ketchim sank back limply into his chair, and his face became ashen."And here is the mail," pursued the gentle Hermes, handing him a
bundle of letters.Ketchim roused himself with an effort."Do
you know whether James has been selling any of his own Molino stock?""I--I believe he has, sir--a little.""He sold some two hundred shares yesterday--I believe; to a Miss
Leveridge.""Why, the Leveridge children--grown men and women now--have just sold
their farm down state; and Mr.James saw the sale announced in the
papers.So he got in touch with Miss Alvina Leveridge.I believe he
sent Houghton down there; and he closed a deal.James got eight
dollars a share, I believe."Ketchim gulped down his wrath, and continued:

"How much did the Leveridges get for their farm?And why didn't you
inform me of the sale?"he demanded, fixing the humble Rawlins with a
cold eye."A--a--twenty-five thousand dollars, sir, I believe.And I didn't see
the notice until--"

"As usual, James saw it first!"James is still dickering with Miss Leveridge, I
suppose?""Nezlett got back last night, didn't he?Very well, call him up and
tell him to get ready to go at once to--wherever the Leveridges live.And--I want to see him right away!"He abruptly dismissed the factotum and turned to his mail.As his
glance fell upon the pile he gasped.Then he quickly drew out a letter
and tore it open.His thin lips moved rapidly as his eyes roved over
the paper.He laid the letter down and looked wildly about.Then he
took it up again and read aloud the closing words:

  "--and, having bought somewhat heavily of Molino stock, and
  believing that your representations were made with intent to
  deceive, I shall, unless immediate reparation or satisfactory
  explanation is made, take such steps as my counsel may advise."Yours, etc.,
                                                 "J. WILTON AMES."Congealing with fear, Ketchim took his stock memorandum from a drawer
and consulted it."He put in ten thousand, cash," he murmured, closing
the book and replacing it."And I always wondered why, for he doesn't
go into things that he can't control.He
shouldn't have been sold a dollar's worth!He knows we can't return
the money; and now he's tightening the screws!He has something up his
sleeve; and we've fallen for it!"He settled back in his chair and groaned aloud.Did
he think he'd reach Uncle Ted through us?For a
year or more he's wanted to oust Uncle from the C.& R., and now he
thinks by threatening the family with disgrace, and us fellows with
the pen, he can do it!Oh, if I ever get out of
this I'll steer clear of these deals in the future!"It was his stock
resolution, which had never borne fruit.The door opened slightly, and the noiseless Rawlins timidly announced
the arrival of Reed and Harris.cried Ketchim, jumping up and hastily passing
his hands over his hair and face.Then, advancing with a wan smile, he
courteously greeted the callers."Well, fellows," he began, waving them to seats, "it looks a
little bad for Molino, doesn't it?I've just been reading your
report--although of course you told me over the 'phone yesterday
that there was no hope.But," he continued gravely, and his face
grew serious, "I'm glad, very glad, of one thing, and that is that
there are men in the world to-day who are above temptation.""Why," continued Ketchim, smiling pallidly, "the little joker that
James inserted in the contract, about your getting fifty thousand in
the event of a favorable report.I told him it didn't look well--but
he said it would test you.He would be funny, though, no matter how
serious the business.Harris snickered; but Reed turned the conversation at once."We have
been studying how we could help you pull the thing out of the fire.Suppose you give us," he suggested, "a little of Molino's history."There isn't much to tell," replied Ketchim gloomily."The mines were
located by a man named Lakes, at one time acting-Consul at Cartagena.He came up to New York and interested
Bryan, Westler, and some others, and they asked us to act as fiscal
agents.""But you never had title to the property," said Reed."Because, on our way down the Magdalena river we made the acquaintance
of a certain Captain Pinal, of the Colombian army.When he learned
that we were mining men he told us he had a string of rich properties
that he would like to sell.I inquired their location, and he said
they lay along the Boque river.And I learned that he had clear title
to the property, too--Molino's mines.Now you have sold some three or
four hundred thousand dollars' worth of stock on alleged mines to
which you never had even the shadow of a claim!""But--" murmured Ketchim weakly, "we thought we had.We acted in good
faith--we took Mr.Lakes's word--and we showed our confidence and
sincerity by purchasing machinery to operate--"

"Oh, the machinery went down there, all right!""I judge it was designed to manufacture barrel staves, rather
than to extract gold!Lakes had it shipped to Cartagena; rented part
of an old woman's house; dumped the machinery in there; and now she's
wild.Can't get her pay from you for storing the machinery; and can't
sell the stuff, nor move it.So there she sits, under some six or
eight tons of iron junk, waiting for the Lord to perform a miracle!""But Molino has no
funds--"

"You are still selling stock, aren't you?""We would not sell any more stock
until we received your report--and not then, unless the report were
favorable.But the image of truth sat enthroned upon
Ketchim's sharp features."It is unfortunate, boys," the promoter continued dejectedly."But I
care nothing for my own losses; it's the poor stockholders I am
thinking about.I've prayed to be
led to do right."I suggest," blurted out Harris, "that, having already relieved them
considerably, you'll soon be wearing a striped suit!"The last trace of color faded from Ketchim's face, but the sickly
smile remained."I'd wear it, willingly, if by so doing I could help
these poor people," he mournfully replied."Well," pursued Harris, "it'll help some when they learn that you're
in one.""Boys," said Ketchim suddenly, quite disregarding the insinuation,
"to-morrow is Sunday, and I want you both out to dinner with me, and
we will talk this all over.Then in the afternoon I want you to come
over and see my little Sunday school.Fellows," he continued gravely,
"I've prayed for you and for your success every day since you left.And my faith in my Saviour is too great to be shattered now by your
adverse report.He certainly will show us a way out; and I can trust
him and wait."Reed and Harris looked at him and then at each other with puzzled
expressions on their faces.The man continued earnestly:

"Colombia is a rich and undeveloped country, you have said.There must
be other mineral properties available there.Did you see none on your
travels?Or could we not organize an exploration party to search for
mines?""Will your sheep stand for further shearing?""Fellows," said Ketchim, brightening and drawing his chair closer,
"you've got something--I know it!You've got something to suggest that
will save the Molino stockholders!""I shall sacrifice myself," answered Ketchim deprecatingly.His manner
had now become animated, and he leaned expectantly toward them.Reed and Harris again looked questioningly at each other."I guess we
might as well," said Reed in a low voice."It is bound to come out,
anyway.""Sure," returned Harris; "drive ahead."Ketchim," began Reed, turning to the eager, fidgeting man, "when
I came to New York a year ago, looking for a business opening, my
friend and former classmate in the University, Mr.Cass, put me in
touch with you.At that time you were booming the Molino company hard,
and, I have no doubt, thought you really had something down in
Colombia.But when you offered to lease me a portion of your
properties there, I laughed at you.And, in the course of time, I
succeeded in convincing you that you knew nothing whatsoever about the
properties on which you were selling so much stock.Then, after months
of parley, from an offer to permit me to go down to Colombia at my own
expense to examine Molino's mines, to ascertain whether or not I
wished to operate a part of them on a royalty basis, you adopted my
own view, namely, that the time had come for you to know whether the
company possessed anything of value or not.And so you sent my
associate, Mr.Harris, and myself down there to examine and report on
Molino's so-called mines.And you gave us each a block of stock as
part compensation.And now you have got to
face a body of stockholders from whom you have lured thousands of
dollars by your misrepresentations.From talks with your salesmen, I
am convinced that this body of stockholders is made up chiefly of
widows and indigent clergymen.""Which of my salesmen told you that?""Let us waive that," replied Reed calmly."The fact is, you are in a
hard way just at present, is it not so?""Fellows," said Ketchim, with an air of penitent humility, "the
officers and stockholders of the Molino Company have been grossly
deceived and unfortunately--"

"All right," interrupted Reed, "we'll pass that.But Harris and I have
played square with you.And we are going to continue to do so, and to
offer you a possible opportunity to do something for your poor
stockholders, and incidentally for yourself and us.The fact is, we do
know of another property down there, but we haven't the title--"

"That makes no difference!""I mean, it can be
acquired--" striving to restrain his eagerness."That's just the question," replied Reed."The title is at present
vested in a young Colombian girl, who, unfortunately, is lost.This
girl came up to the States with us--"

"Ha!"exclaimed Ketchim, unable longer to hold himself."Then you
broke your contract, for that stipulated that whatever you might
acquire there should belong to me!"I believe," put in Harris dryly, "we were employed by the Molino
company.""But my mother advanced the funds to send you down there!"queried Harris, with an insinuating
grin."I'm speaking for the stockholders, of course," said Ketchim,
subsiding."There is no likelihood that this poor girl will ever be heard of
again," continued Reed."Nor is it likely that the title papers, which
she has with her, will be of any use to those into whose hands she has
fallen.Her old foster-father held the title to this mine, but
transferred it to the girl, stipulating that she and I should divide a
large interest in the stock of a company formed to develop and operate
it.For my share, I agreed to bring the young girl to the States and
place her in a school, at my own expense."He went on to relate the
manner in which Carmen had been lost, and then continued: "Of course,
the title to this mine is registered in Cartagena, and in the girl's
name, as the old man gave me power to have that change made.But, now
that she is gone, the property naturally reverts to him.""No, that wouldn't be right to the old man," returned Reed."But, it
might be that the property could now be secured from him.He is old
and penniless, and without any further interest in life.It is a bare
chance, but we might prevail upon him to join us in the formation of a
company to take over his mine, La Libertad."asked Ketchim, reaching for a writing pad.Reed complied, and then continued: "Now, Mr.Ketchim, we are living
strictly up to the letter of our contract by giving you this
information.It would require not less than one hundred thousand
dollars, cash in hand, to acquire that mine, develop it, make trails,
and erect a stamp-mill.Harris and I are in no condition
financially to advance or secure such an amount.""It is barely possible," mused Harris, "that my father and Uncle John
could do something.""We don't have to call upon them!"Reed, in this mine already belongs to Molino, as you were acting under
contract with us--"

"I have covered that point, Mr."But
the time has come for us all to put our shoulders to the wheel, act
fairly with one another, help the Molino stockholders, and at the same
time make good ourselves.Harris and I have barely entered upon
our business careers, and we have come to New York to establish
ourselves.We know where this mine
is--we know the old man, and may be able to influence him.To
forestall possible complications, we should begin negotiations with
him at once.But--remember--everything must be done in the name of the
company, not in your own name.Harris and I must personally
negotiate with the old man, and receive a very liberal compensation
for our work."why didn't
you tell me this yesterday over the 'phone, and save me a night of
torment?Rawlins," he said, addressing
that individual, who had entered in response to the buzzer, "'phone
Cass to come right over.And tell Miss Honeywell to give you ten
dollars for our lunch, and charge it to Molino.Since the old man gave
you a share in the mine, Molino has property, after all!""Has it to get," amended Harris dubiously.cried Ketchim, rubbing his hands gleefully."But
now while waiting for Cass, tell me more about your trip.In the midst of the ensuing recital, Cass was announced; and Ketchim,
after detailing to him the previous conversation, launched into the
project which had been developing in his own mind while Reed had been
describing his experiences in the South."What we want is another organization, fellows," he said in
conclusion, "to take over the tottering Molino; purchase its assets
with stock; give Molino stockholders an opportunity to get in on the
ground floor, and so on.We'll let Molino die in the arms of a new
company, eh?""But one with a somewhat wider scope," suggested Cass, with an air of
importance."A sort of general development company, to secure La
Libertad, if possible; prospect for other mineral properties; and
develop the resources of the country.""Just so," assented Ketchim, with increasing enthusiasm."A company to
go in for coffee, cotton--you say you saw wild cotton, didn't you,
fellows?And cocoanuts, timber, cattle--in fact, we'll get
concessions from the Colombian Government, and we'll--"

"Just rip things wide open, eh?""Uncle Ted has influence at
Washington, with the Pan American Union, and so on--why, we can get
anything we want!Ames and the bank will both cool down--by Jove, this
is great!""But where's the cold and vulgar cash coming from to oil the wheels?""Oh, I can sell the stock," replied Ketchim."Then, too, there's the
Molino stockholders; why, I'll bet there's hardly one that wouldn't be
able to scrape up a few dollars more for the new company!By the way,
what'll we call it?"I'd call it the Salvation Company," drawled Harris, "as it is likely
to delay your trip to Sing Sing."A general laugh, in which Ketchim joined heartily, followed the
remark."I suggest we call it the Simiti Development Company," said Cass,
after a moment's dignified reflection."If these gentlemen can acquire that mine, I
think I would capitalize for, say, about three millions."He went to
the desk and made some calculations."I assume," he continued somewhat
pompously after a few moments' figuring, "that you wish to retain me,
and that I am to take my compensation in stock?"He knew that Cass had correctly concluded
that in no other way was he likely to be reimbursed.And, at best, it
was only a hazard, a wild gamble.In fact, it was a last desperate
chance.Moreover, stock was always available; while cash was a rare
commodity."Suppose, then," continued the sapient young lawyer, "that we
capitalize for three millions; set aside one million, five hundred and
one thousand as treasury stock, to be sold to raise money for
development purposes; transfer to the Ketchim Realty Company one
million, as compensation for acting as fiscal agents of the new
company; transfer to these two gentlemen, as part compensation for
past and future services, the sum of four hundred thousand in stock;
give to the stockholders of the Molino Company the sum of fifty-nine
thousand in stock for all the assets, machinery, good will, _et
cetera_, of that company; and to me, for services to be rendered,
forty thousand dollars' worth of the stock.All of us shall agree not
to sell any of our personal holdings of stock until the company shall
be placed upon a dividend-paying basis.Harris,
or both, will return to Colombia immediately to relocate the mine, and
prepare for its development, while the Ketchim Realty Company at once
endeavor to sell the treasury stock."Having delivered himself of this comprehensive plan, Cass settled back
in his chair and awaited remarks."Well," observed Ketchim at length, "that's all right--only, I think
we should be allowed to sell our personal stock if we wish.Of
course," with a deprecating wave of his hand, "there isn't the
slightest likelihood of our ever wanting to do that--with a mine such
as you have described, fellows."Not one dollar's worth of your stock shall you be permitted to sell!"cried Harris, bringing his fist down upon the desk."I suggest that we leave that for the Directors to decide later,"
offered Cass, anxious to avoid discord.He was young, scarcely out of
the twenties, just married, just admitted to the bar, and eager to get
a toe-hold in the world of business."And now," he concluded, "if
agreeable to you, I will put this through at once, organize the
company, and get the charter.You gentlemen will return to Colombia as
soon as Mr.Harris and I have formed an engineering partnership," said Reed."As such, we will handle the affairs of the new company in Colombia.Harris will proceed to that country, while I go to California to
open a copper mine which we have taken over there."I'll send Houghton and Nezlett out on the road to-morrow.Rawlins
has just told me of one prospect, a bully one!We don't need to
wait for the papers from Albany before going ahead.But we find it
costs about forty-eight cents to sell a dollar's worth of stock, and
so some time will be needed to raise enough to send Mr.Harris back
to Colombia--unless," he added, eying Harris furtively, "he will
advance us the amount of his own expenses--"

"Which he will not!""There's a revolution on down there now," said Reed, "and we'd better
go easy for a while.Besides, Harris needs time to study the language.But, are we all agreed on the terms?Salary for Harris while in
Colombia to be settled later, of course.""It's all satisfactory, I think," said Ketchim, smiling happily."The
details can be worked out anon--Molino stockholders' meeting, and so
on.""Then," said Reed, rising, "we will consider the new company launched,
to take over the defunct Molino and to operate on a comprehensive
scale in Colombia, beginning with the development of La Libertad, if
we can secure it."At that moment Rawlins opened the door and peered in.Reed," he announced softly; "a priest, I believe."The door swung open, and Father Waite
entered with Carmen.With a glad cry the girl dropped her bundle and bounded into the arms
of the astonished Harris.Reed grasped the priest's hand, and begged
him to speak.Ketchim and the young lawyer looked on in perplexity."I was unable to find your name in the city directory, Mr.Reed,"
explained the priest, his face beaming with happiness."But at police
headquarters I found that you had made inquiries, and that detectives
were searching for the girl.I learned that you were living with your
wife's sister, and that you had no business address, having just come
up from South America.So I telephoned to your sister-in-law, and your
wife informed me that you had an appointment this morning at this
office.I therefore came directly here with the girl, who, as you see,
is safe and sound, but with an additional interesting experience or
two to add to the large fund she already possessed."He looked down at
Carmen and smiled."And now," he concluded, laughing, as he prepared
to depart, "I will not ask for a receipt for the child, as I see I
have several witnesses to the fact that I have delivered her to the
proper custodian."cried Reed, seizing him by the hand.We
want to know you--"

"I will give you my card," replied the priest."And I would be very
happy, indeed, if some time again I might be permitted to see and talk
with the little girl."He handed his card to Reed; then nodded and
smiled at Carmen and went out.sputtered Harris, pushing the girl aside and making after
him.The priest had already caught a descending
elevator, and disappeared."I
guess that knocks the Simiti Company sky-high," he exclaimed, "for
here is the sole owner of La Libertad!"Ketchim collapsed into a chair, while Reed, saying that he would keep
his dinner engagement with Ketchim on the following day, picked up
Carmen's precious bundle and, taking her hand, left the room."I am
going home," he called back to Harris; "and you be sure to come up to
the house to-night.We'll have to readjust our plans now."CHAPTER 5


"Reed," said Harris the following day, as they sat in the dusty,
creaking car that was conveying them to their dinner appointment with
Ketchim, "who is this Ames that Ketchim referred to yesterday?"The men were not alone, for Carmen accompanied them.Reed was
reluctantly bringing her at the urgent request received from Ketchim
over the telephone the previous evening.But the girl, subdued by the
rush of events since her precipitation into the seething American
world of materialism, sat apart from them, gazing with rapt attention
through the begrimed window at the flying scenery, and trying to
interpret it in the light of her own tenacious views of life and the
universe.If the marvels of this new world into which she had been
thrown had failed to realize her expectations--if she saw in them, and
in the sense of life which they express, something less real, less
substantial, than do those who laud its grandeur and power to
charm--she gave no hint.She was still absorbing, sifting and
digesting the welter of impressions.She had been overpowered,
smothered by the innovation; and she now found her thoughts a tangled
jumble, which she strove incessantly to unravel and classify according
to their content of reality, as judged by her own standards."Why, Ames," replied Reed, turning a watchful eye upon Carmen, "is a
multimillionaire financier of New York--surely you have heard of him!He and his clique practically own the United States, and a large
slice of Europe.For some reason Ames bought a block of Molino stock.And now, I judge, Ketchim would give his chances on eternal life if he
hadn't sold it to him.And that's what's worrying me, too.For, since
Ames is heavily interested in Molino, what will he do to the new
company that absorbs it?""There isn't going to be any new company," asserted Harris doggedly."Ketchim holds us strictly to our
contract.Our negotiations with old Rosendo were made while in the
employ of Molino.It wouldn't be so bad if we had only Ketchim to deal
with.We've got the goods on him and could beat him.But here enters
Ames, a man of unlimited wealth and influence.If he wants La
Libertad, he's going to get it, you mark me!Where we fell down was in
ever mentioning it to Ketchim.For if we don't come over now he will
lay the whole affair before Ames.He told me over the 'phone last
night that he was badly in debt--that Ames was pressing him--that many
of the Molino stockholders were making pertinent inquiries.And yesterday I saw on his desk a letter from
Ames.Ketchim would sacrifice us and
everything else to keep himself out of Ames's grip.We're in for it, I
tell you!And all because we were a bit too previous in believing that
the girl had disappeared for good."exclaimed Harris, "but doesn't it sound like a fairy-tale,
the way Carmen got back to us?""And here I am," continued Reed, with a gesture of vexation, "left
with the girl on my hands, and with a very healthy prospect of losing
out all around.My wife said emphatically last night that she wouldn't
be bothered with Carmen.""But do you realize
that that involves expense?I'm a comparatively poor man, just getting
a start in my profession, and with a young and socially ambitious
wife!""But--your wife--er, she's going to--to have money some day, isn't
she?"But the grim reaper has a little work to do first.And on
occasions like this he's always deucedly deliberate, you know.Meantime, we're skating close to the edge--for New Yorkers.""Well, we may be able to beat Ketchim.Now, my father and Uncle
John--"

"Oh, shoot your father and Uncle John!"The conductor opened the door and bawled a cryptical announcement."This is the place," said Reed, starting up and making for the door."And now you rake your thought for some way to deal with Ketchim.And
leave your father and Uncle John entirely out of the conversation!"Ketchim was just bowing out a caller as the young engineers mounted
the steps.he exclaimed, after giving them a hearty
welcome."I just sold him a hundred shares of Simiti stock, at five
dollars a share--just half of par."But--" protested Harris, as they entered the spacious parlor, "the
company isn't even in existence yet--and hasn't an asset!""Oh, that's all right," replied Ketchim easily."It's coming into
existence, and will have the grandest mine in South America!Boys," he
went on earnestly, "I've been talking over the 'phone with Mr.Ames,
our most influential stockholder, and a very warm friend of mine.I
told him about our conversation of yesterday.He says, go right ahead
with the new company--that it's a great idea.He's satisfied with his
present holding, and will not increase it.Says he wants Molino
stockholders to have the opportunity to purchase all the treasury
stock, if they want to.""Decidedly magnanimous," returned Reed."But--what about the basis of
organization of the new company?""Leave it as we planned it, he says.He thinks the arrangement and
division of stock fine!"Reed and Harris looked at each other questioningly."But," went on Ketchim, "have you seen the morning papers?They are
full of the revolution in Colombia.The country is torn wide open,
and reports say nothing can be done down there until peace is
restored--and that may take a year or two.But, meantime, we will go
ahead and organize the new company and take over Molino and prepare
to begin work just as soon as you fellows can get into that country.And so this," going to
Carmen and taking her hand, "is the wonderful little girl!Ketchim and her troop of children at this
juncture interrupted the conversation."All enthusiastic Simiti
stockholders," said Ketchim, waving his hand toward them, after the
introductions."And all going to get rich out of it, too--as well as
yourselves, boys.It simply shows how Providence works--one with God
is a majority, always."Carmen glanced up at him wonderingly.Dinner over, the men were left alone.Carmen had been taken upstairs
by the children to the nursery."I've got myself slated for the presidency of the new company," said
Ketchim, plunging again into the subject nearest his heart; "and I
think we'd better put brother James in as vice-president.Perfectly
safe," looking at Harris and winking."He's got to be recognized, you
know, since the Ketchim Realty Company act as fiscal agents.Now for
directors I've put down Judge Harris, your father--that's to assure
you boys that there'll be some one to look after your interests.Then
we'll say Reverend Jurges for another.He's got a big congregation and
will be able to place a lot of stock.You just ought to see the letter
he wrote me about selling stock to his people!You'd never believe he
was a good, spiritually-minded clergyman, with an eye single to
heavenly riches!Then one of you fellows, say Reed, had better go on
the directorate, since Harris will be in Colombia in charge of
operations.He's young and immature, but
absolutely square.He'll do all the legal work for his stock interest."But what do I do while we are waiting?"asked Harris in some
perplexity."Reed goes to California right away, you know.""That's all right, old man," Ketchim genially assured him."The new
company will be organized at once--this week, if possible.You go on
salary from the moment of its incorporation, and you open your office
right here in this building.I'll see that the rent is paid until you
go back to Colombia.Everything's arranged, and you turn right in and
help Cass with the new company.You've got
to prepare circulars; write boosting letters to stockholders and
prospects; follow up leads; and--oh, you'll be busy!But here comes
Reverend Coles," looking out of the window as a man came up the steps."He's interested in some projects I've been exploiting.He hastened out to greet the visitor and conducted him into a back
room.Reed and Harris were left to the contemplation of their own
mixed thoughts.Presently Harris, whose eyes had been dilating
for some moments, broke out in a hoarse whisper: "Listen!God
a'mighty!--he's praying!"He got up softly and approached the door of the room into which
Ketchim had taken his caller.In a few minutes he returned to his
chair."I could see Ketchim through the
keyhole, on his knees by the bed, praying with that fellow!Through the silence that fell upon
them snatches of the prayer being offered in the adjoining room
floated to their ears--"O, blessed Saviour, vouchsafe prosperity to
our venture, we beseech thee!The earth is the Lord's, and the
fullness thereof--we ask thy blessing on these efforts of ours to
wrest from the ground the wealth which the Father of lights has
deposited there for the benefit of His children--"

Harris snickered aloud."It may not be a game," he replied."But if it is, it's an old one, hiding behind the mask of religion.But I'm inclined to believe the man sincere."I
know James to be an out-and-out rascal--he openly flies the black
flag.But this pious fellow--well, he's got me guessing!"The caller soon departed, and Ketchim again joined the young men."He's our assistant pastor," he said musingly, as he watched the man
go down the walk."Nice young fellow, waiting for a church.He and
some of his friends are interested in a zinc mine we've been floating,
down in the Joplin district."queried the cynical Harris, with a twinkle in his eyes."Oh, yes," Ketchim smiled affably.Lots of development work to be done, you know.And there's a lot of water in this mine.""And in the stock, too, eh?""We haven't struck the deposit yet, although we expect to soon.But,"
glancing up at the clock on the mantel, "we'll have to be going over
to Sunday school now.And I want that little girl to go with Marjorie.Fellows," the man's face became deeply serious, "I have no doubt you
are both church members?"Reed fidgeted uneasily under Ketchim's searching glance; but Harris
frankly met the question."Nope," he asserted, "we're both rank
heathen.And I'm a dyed-in-the-wool atheist."cried Ketchim, "how can you say that, when you see the
goodness of the Lord on every hand?""Reed, I believe," continued the imperturbable Harris, waving a hand
toward his friend, "has philosophical leanings--New Thought,
Subliminal Consciousness, Power in Silence, and all that."But surely you believe in the divinity of the Christ?""Well, as a matter of fact, I never gave it much thought," said
Harris."Ah, that's what so many say," replied Ketchim sadly; "and then comes
the awful voice of the Lord, 'This night thy soul shall be required of
thee!'Fellows, I want to pray for you; and I want you both to promise
me that you will take up seriously the consideration of your souls'
welfare.It's too grave a subject for jest," addressing himself
solemnly to the grinning Harris."All right, old man," laughed Harris."But don't dig up any
Presbyterian tracts for me.I've got a living witness to--well, to
something out of the ordinary, in that girl, Carmen, and I'm inclined
to believe she's dug nearer to bottom facts than any of you.So when
I'm ready to discuss my soul's welfare I'll just consult her, see?""That reminds me," said Ketchim, turning abruptly to Reed, "what do
you intend to do with the girl?""_Quien sabe?_" Reed answered abstractedly."Send her to a boarding
school, I guess.At least, that's what I told the old man I'd do.""So you said before," Ketchim returned.My daughter Marjorie leaves Tuesday
for Conway-on-the-Hudson, where she has been attending Madam Elwin's
Select School for Girls.Suppose you go with her--I'm too busy,
myself--and take Carmen.It's only a few hours' ride by boat down the
river.This is Marjorie's third year
there, and she's simply in love with it."Reed began to show signs of interest; and Ketchim, noting the effect
of his words, went on briskly:

"Now look here, Molino owes its salvation, and the new company its
existence, to that girl.Why shouldn't they do something to show their
gratitude?I say, it is no more than right that the new company should
support her while she is in school."not a half-bad idea," commented Harris."Certainly not," continued Ketchim earnestly."Now fix up everything
with her as regards the transfer of the mine to the new company, and
then let her go with Marjorie to the Elwin school.We can, if you
like, make some agreement with her to the effect that when the company
is on its feet and she is receiving dividends, she shall return what
it may advance for her schooling, eh?""You'd better accept the suggestion, Reed," put in Harris."I'll be
here, you know, to keep an eye on the girl; and I'll take her and
Marjorie down to Conway myself, and attend to getting her located
right."He was hardly in a position to refuse such
an offer.Besides, he was really leaving her in charge of Harris."Well," he said at length, "in that case I could leave for California
to-morrow night.That matter is pressing hard--all right, I accept the
company's offer.It's no more than is due the girl, anyway.""I'll make the necessary arrangements at
once.Thus it was that two days later Carmen, still wondering if she was
dreaming, was enrolled in the Elwin Select School for Girls, with
Marjorie Ketchim for roommate; while Reed, on the Overland Limited,
hurrying to the far West, was musing dubiously at frequent intervals
on Ketchim's rather conflicting statements, which, until left to this
enforced leisure, he had not had time to try to reconcile.At the same
time, while Harris was loudly declaiming to the gracious Madam Elwin
on the astonishing mental prowess of the girl, Ketchim and Cass sat
deeply immersed in the tentative plans for the newly-projected Simiti
Development Company."Now listen," said Ketchim, who for some minutes had been quietly
scanning his youthful lawyer, "Ames knows nothing about the formation
of this company, but Harris and Reed are not to know that; and we're
going to keep Ames in ignorance of all our plans.With the first sales
of stock--and they've already begun--we'll return him his Molino
investment.Nezlett wired me this morning that he's sure to sell a big
block to the Leveridges, that they're mightily interested, and want to
meet Carmen.We'll use the girl for just such purposes.That's one
reason why I wanted her handy, so's we could reach her at any time.She makes a star impression; and with her as an advertisement we'll
sell a million dollars' worth of stock, and no trouble at all!She's
got that honest look that's convincing.And she can tell a story that
beats the Arabian Nights!Ames has given me a week to explain, or make
good his investment.By that time we'll have the Leveridges sold for
twice his investment, and we'll just pay him off and remove him.Meantime, you go over to the bank in the morning and put up the best
line of talk you're capable of.I've got sixteen hundred dollars to
give 'em on that note; and that'll secure more time, until the sales
of stock are enough to pay it all up.Perhaps Uncle Ted will advance
me enough to take up the note when he hears about La Libertad.And,
say, you see brother James, and shake the club over him until he
disgorges that check he got from Miss Leveridge.You can hand him a
scare that he won't get over.things have taken a
great turn, eh?Why, I can just see Simiti stock sales humping these
next few months.Oh, Miss Honeywell," calling to his cashier, "bring
me five dollars, please, and charge it to Molino--I mean, to Simiti.Then, again addressing Cass: "Come
with me to the football game this afternoon.We can discuss plans
there as well as here.Gee whiz, but I feel great!"CHAPTER 6


Carmen's rapid transition from the eternal solitudes of Guamoco to the
whirring activities of New York was like a plunge into the maelstrom,
and left her groping blindly in the effort to adapt herself to the
changed order.There was little in her former mode of existence that
could be transferred to her new environment, and she felt that she was
starting life like a new-born babe.For days, even weeks, she moved
about dreamily, absorbed, ceaselessly striving to orient herself and
to accept easily and naturally the marvels, the sudden accession of
material aids, and the wonders of this modern, complex civilization,
so common to her associates, but scarcely even dreamed of by her in
her former home, despite the preparation which Jose had tried to give
her.The Elwin school was small, its student-body seldom numbering
more than fifty, and in it Carmen found herself hedged about by
restrictions which in a way were beneficial, in that they narrowed her
environment and afforded her time for her slow adjustment to it.But if these restrictions aided her, they also rendered the length of
her stay in the school almost calculable.Little by little the girl
saw the forces developing which she knew must effect her dismissal;
little by little, as Madam Elwin's manner toward her became less
gracious, and her schoolmates made fewer efforts to conceal from her
the fact that she was not one of them, Carmen prepared for the
inevitable.Six months after the girl's enrollment, Madam Elwin
terminated her series of disparaging reports to Ketchim by a request
that he come at once and remove his charge from the school.Ketchim, the girl is a paradox.And
after these months of disappointing effort to instruct her, I am
forced to throw up my hands in despair and send for you."Madam Elwin
tapped nervously with a dainty finger upon the desk before her."But, if I may be permitted the question, what specific reasons have
you, Madam, for--ah, for requesting her removal?"William Jurges, who, having come up to the city to
attend a meeting of the directors of the Simiti company, had accepted
Ketchim's invitation to first accompany him on his flying trip to
Conway-on-the-Hudson, in response to Madam Elwin's peremptory
summons."Because," replied that worthy personage with a show of exasperation, "I
consider her influence upon the young ladies here quite detrimental.Our school, while non-sectarian, is at least Christian.Where she got her views, I can not imagine.At first she made
frequent mention of a Catholic priest, who taught her in her home town,
in South America.But of late she has grown very reserved--I might say,
sullen, and talks but little.Her views, however, are certainly not
Catholic.She refuses to
accept a large part of our instruction.Her answers to examination
questions are wholly in accord with her peculiar views, and hence quite
apart from the texts.For that reason she fails to make any grades,
excepting in mathematics and the languages.She utterly refuses to
accept any religious instruction whatsoever.She would not be called
atheistic, for she talks--or used to at first--continually about God.But her God is not the God of the Scriptures, Dr.She is a
free-thinker, in the strictest sense.And as such, we can not
consent to her remaining longer with us.""Ah--quite so, Madam, quite so," returned the clergyman, in his
unconsciously pompous manner."Doubtless the child's thought
became--ah--contaminated ere she was placed in your care.But--ah--I
have heard so much from our good friend, Mr.Ketchim, regarding this
young girl, that--ah--I should like exceedingly to see and talk with
her--if it might be--ah--"

"Madam Elwin will arrange that, I am sure," interposed Ketchim."Suppose," he suggested, addressing the lady, "we let him talk with
her, while I discuss with you our recently acquired mine in South
America, and the advisability of an investment with us.""Certainly," acquiesced Madam Elwin, rising and pressing one of the
several buttons in the desk."Bring Miss Carmen," she directed, to the
maid who answered the summons.Jurges; "but may I go to her?Ah--it
would doubtless be less embarrassing for the child.""Miss Carmen was in the chapel a few moments ago," volunteered the
maid."Then take the doctor there," returned Madam Elwin, with a gesture of
dismissal.At the head of the stairway the mingled sounds of a human voice and
the soft, trembling notes of an organ drifted through the long hall
and fell upon the ears of the clergyman."Miss Carmen," said the maid, answering his unspoken thought."She
often comes up to the chapel and sings for hours at a time--alone.The
chapel is down there," pointing to the end of the hall."Then--ah--leave me," said the doctor.The maid turned willingly and went below, while the man tiptoed to
the chapel door.The girl was
singing in Spanish, and he could not understand the words.But they
would have meant nothing to him then.It was the voice upon which
they were borne that held him.The song was a weird lament that had
come down to the children of Simiti from the hard days of the
_Conquistadores_.It voiced the untold wrongs of the Indian slaves;
its sad, unvarying minor echoed their smothered moans under the
cruel goad; on the plaintive melody of the repeated chorus their
piteous cries were carried to heaven's deaf ears; their dull despair
floated up on the wailing tones of the little organ, and then died
away, as died the hope of the innocent victims of Spanish lust.The reverend doctor had never heard a song of that kind before.Nor
could he readily associate the voice, which again and again he could
not distinguish from the flute-like tones of the organ, with the
sordidness and grime of material, fleshly existence.He entered softly
and took a seat in the shadow of a pillar.The clear, sweet voice of
the young girl flowed over him like celestial balm.Some were dreamy bits and snatches in Spanish and English;
others were sacred in character.He wondered deeply, as the girl mused
over these; yet he knew not that they were her own compositions.Curiosity and uncertainty mastered him at length, and he got softly to
his feet and moved away from the pillar, that he might see from what
manner of being issued such unbroken harmony.But in his eagerness his
foot struck a chair, and the sound echoed loudly through the room.The music abruptly ceased, and the girl rose and looked over the organ
at the intruder."I--I beg your pardon," said the clergyman, advancing in some
embarrassment."I was listening to your singing--uninvited, but none
the less appreciative.I--"

"Wait, please!"cried the girl, hastily stooping over and fumbling
with her shoes.The doctor laughed genially, as he grasped the
situation."I took them off," she explained hurriedly."I am not yet accustomed
to them.I never wore shoes until I left Simiti."Her face was
scarlet, and she tried to cover her confusion with a little laugh.The doctor stood staring at her, lost in admiration of the shapely
figure, the heavy, curling hair, and the wonderfully expressive face.The girl quickly recovered her poise and returned him a frank smile.she said, after waiting in vain for him to
begin."Ah--a--yes, certainly--that is, I beg your pardon," stammered the
doctor."I did request permission of Madam Elwin to make your
acquaintance.I am Doctor Jurges, an
Episcopal clergyman."His sentences issued like blasts from an engine
exhaust."I am Carmen Ariza," said the girl, extending her hand."Ah--quite so, quite so," blustered the doctor, clearing his throat
noisily.Ah--ah--you have a remarkable voice.And my poor organ-playing is what I have
picked up myself these six months."The girl looked up into his face searchingly."Why," she asked,
"should every one up here think it remarkable when a human mind is
clear enough to be a transparency for God?"Had the roof fallen, the excellent doctor could have been no more
startled.He cleared his throat violently again; then fumbled
nervously in his pocket and drew out his glasses.These he poised upon
the ample arch of his ecclesiastical nose, and through them turned a
penetrating glance upon the girl.yes," said he at length; "quite so, quite so!And--ah--Miss
Carmen, that brings us to the matter in question--your religious
instruction--ah--may I ask from whom you received it?""From God," was the immediate and frank reply.The clergyman started, but quickly recovered his equipoise.But--your religious views--I believe they are not
considered--ah--quite evangelical, are they?By your present
associates, that is.""No," she replied, with a trace of sadness in her tone."But," looking
up with a queer little smile, "I am not persecuting them for that.""Oh, no," with a jerky little laugh.I judge the
persecution has come from the other side, has it not?""We will not speak of that," she said quickly."They do not
understand--that is all."no, quite so--that is--ah--may I ask why you think they do not
understand?"If that which I believe is not true," the girl replied evenly, "it
will fail under the test of demonstration.Their beliefs have long
since failed under such test--and yet they still cling jealously to
them, and try to force them upon all who disagree with them.I am a
heretic, Doctor.""H'm--ah--yes, I see.But--it is a quite unfortunate characteristic
of mankind to attribute one's views indiscriminately to the
Almighty--and--ah--I regret to note that you are not wholly free from
this error.""You do not understand, I think," she quickly returned."I put every
view, every thought, every idea to the test.If good is the result, I
know that the thought or idea comes from the source of all good, God.The views I hold are those which I have time and again tested--and
some of them have withstood trials which I think you would regard as
unusually severe."Her thought had rested momentarily upon her vivid
experience in Banco, the dangers which had menaced her in distant
Simiti, and the fire through which she had passed in her first hours
in Christian America, the land of churches, sects, and creeds.the worthy doctor mused, regarding the girl first through his
spectacles, and then over the tops of them, while his bushy eyebrows
moved up and down with such comicality that Carmen could scarcely
refrain from laughing.Ah--suppose you relate to me
some of the tests to which your views have been subjected.""No," she returned firmly; "those experiences were only states of
consciousness, which are now past and gone forever.Why go back now and give them the
appearance of reality?"H'm--then you do not regard untoward experience as given us
by God for the testing of our faith, I take it."Carmen turned her head away with a little sigh of weariness."I
think," she said slowly, "I think we had better not talk about these
things, Doctor."Why--ah," blustered the clergyman, assuming a more paternal air,
"we--ah--would not for a moment cause you embarrassment, Miss Carmen!But--in fact, Madam Elwin has--ah--expressed her disapproval of your
views--your religious ideals, if I may put it so baldly, and she--that
is--the good lady regrets--"

"She wishes to be rid of me, you mean, Doctor?"said the girl,
turning and stretching a mental hand to the sinking divine.well, hardly so--ah--so--"

"Doctor," said the girl calmly, "I know it, and I wish to go.I have
been waiting only to see the way open.I do not wish to remain longer
in an atmosphere where ignorance and false belief stifle all real
progress."The doctor turned another look of astonishment upon her.He had
forgotten that he had not been talking with one of his own age.But if her clear mental gaze
penetrated the ecclesiastical mask and surmounted the theological
assumptions of her interlocutor, enabling her to get close to the
heart of the man, she did not indicate it further."I am nearly
sixteen," was her only reply."Ah," he reflected, "just a child!My dear girl," he continued, laying
a hand indulgently upon hers, "I will advise with Madam Elwin, and
will endeavor to convince her that--ah--that your spiritual welfare,
if I may so put it, requires that you be not turned adrift at this
critical, transitorial period of your life.We must all be patient,
while we strive to counteract the--ah--the pernicious teaching to
which you were exposed before--ah--before becoming enrolled in this
excellent school."Carmen looked at him steadily for a moment before replying.There was
something of pity in the expression of her beautiful face, of tender
sympathy for those who seek the light, and who must some day find it,
but whose progress is as yet hampered by the human mind's unreasoning
adherence to the stepping-stones over which it has been passing
through the dark waters of ignorance."Then, Doctor," she said calmly,
"you know what I have been taught?""Why--ah--yes--that is, vaguely.He was beginning to be sensible of having passed judgment upon the
girl without first according her a hearing."Well," she smiled up at him, "I have been taught the very hardest
thing in the whole world."He again clutched at his mental poise.But--ah--is it not the function of all our schools to teach
us to think?""No," answered the girl decidedly; "not to teach us to think, but to
cause us blindly to accept what is ignorantly called 'authority'!I
find we are not to reason, and particularly about religious matters,
but to accept, to let those 'in authority' think for us.Are you not even now seeking to make me accept your religious views?Oh, no; but because you believe them
true--whether they are or not.Do your religious views rest upon anything
but the human mind's undemonstrated interpretation of the Bible?And
yet you can not prove that interpretation true, even though you would
force it upon such as I, who may differ from you.""I--ah--" began the doctor nervously.But Carmen continued without
heeding the interruption:

"Only yesterday Professor Bales, of the University, lectured here on
'The Prime Function of Education.'He said it was the development of
the individual, and that the chief end of educational work was the
promotion of originality.And yet, when I think along original
lines--when I depart from stereotyped formulae, and state boldly that I
will not accept any religion, be it Presbyterian, Methodist, or Roman
Catholic, that makes a God of spirit the creator of a man of flesh, or
that makes evil as real as good, and therefore necessarily created and
recognized by a God who by very necessity can not know evil--then I am
accused of being a heretic, a free-thinker; and the authorities take
steps to remove me, lest my influence contaminate the rest of the
pupils!""H'm--ah--yes, quite so--that is--I think--"

"Do you, a preacher, think?""Or do you
only _think_ that you think?Do you still believe with the world that
the passing of a stream of human thought, or a series of mental
pictures, through your mentality constitutes _real_ thinking?Do you
believe that jumping from one human mental concept to another
twenty-four hours a day constitutes thinking?Have you yet learned to
distinguish between God's thoughts and their opposites, human
thoughts?Have you a real, working,
demonstrable knowledge of Christianity?Do you heal the sick, raise
the dead, and preach the truth that sets men free from the mesmerism
of evil?If so, then you are unevangelical, too, and you and I are
both heretics, and we'd better--we'd better leave this building at
once, for I find that the Inquisition is still alive, even in
America!"Her face was flushed, and her
whole body quivered with emotion.Why, my dear young lady, this is a Christian
nation!""Then," said the girl, "you have still much to learn from the pagan
nations that have gone before."exclaimed the doctor, again adjusting his glasses
that he might see her more clearly."My dear child, you have been
thinking too much, and too seriously.""No, Doctor," she replied; "but you preachers have not been thinking
enough, nor even half seriously.Oh," she went on, while her eyes grew
moist, and ever and again her throat filled, "I had expected so much
in this great country!And I have found so little--so little that is
not wholly material, mechanical, and unreal!I had imagined that, with
all your learning and progress, which Padre Jose told me about, you
would know God much better than we in the darkened South.But your god
is matter, machinery, business, gold, and the unreal things that can
be bought with money.Some one wrote, in a recent newspaper, that
America's god was'mud and mammon!'What do I find the girls here in
this school talking about but dress, and society, and the unreal,
passing pleasures of the physical senses!There are religious services here every
Sunday, and sermons by preachers who come down from the city.Sometimes a Baptist; sometimes a Presbyterian; and sometimes an
Episcopalian, or a Methodist.Each has a different concept of God; yet they all believe
Him the creator of a man of flesh and bones, a man who was originally
made perfect, but who fell, and was then cursed by the good and
perfect God who made him.Oh, what childish views for men to hold and
preach!How could a good God create anything that could fall?And if
He could, and did, then He knew in advance that the man would fall,
and so God becomes responsible, not man.Oh, Doctor, is it possible
that you believe such stuff?Is it any
wonder that, holding such awful views, you preachers have no longer
the power to heal the sick?Do you not know that, in order to heal the
sick, one must become spiritually-minded?But no one who holds to the
puerile material beliefs embraced in your orthodox theology can
possibly be spiritual enough to do the works Jesus said we should all
do if we followed him--really understood him.""My dear child--you really are quite inconsistent--you--"

"Inconsistent!What a charge for an orthodox preacher to bring!Let us
see: You say that the Scriptures teach that God made man in His image
and likeness--the image and likeness of spirit.Spirit,
God, is eternal, immortal.Then while He exists can His image fade
away, or die?Can or would God cause it to do so?Can or would He
destroy His own reflection?And could that image, always being like
Him, ever change, or manifest sin, or disease, or evil, unless God
first manifested these things?And if God did manifest them, then,
perforce, the image would _have_ to do likewise.But, in that case,
could God justly punish His image for faithfully reflecting its
original?Oh, it is you preachers, lacking sufficient
spirituality to correctly interpret the Scriptures, who are wildly,
childishly, ignorantly inconsistent!"Carmen rose and faced the clergyman."I did not mean to condemn
you, Doctor," she said earnestly."I wage no warfare with persons
or things.My opposition is directed only against the entrenched human
thought that makes men spiritually blind and holds them in the
mesmeric chains of evil.I am young, as you reckon years, but I
have had much experience in the realm of thought--and it is there
that all experience is wrought out before it becomes externalized.I have told you, my teacher was God.He used as a channel a priest,
who came years ago to my little home town of Simiti, in far-off
Colombia.His life had been wrecked by holding to the belief of
evil as a power, real and intelligent.He began to see the light; but
he did not overcome fear sufficiently to make his demonstration and
break the imaginary bonds which held him.He saw, but he did not
prove.And, Doctor, you and everybody else will
have to do the same.For, unless Jesus uttered the most malicious
falsehoods ever voiced, every human being will have to take every
step that he took, make every demonstration that he made, and prove
all that he proved, before mortals will cease to consume with
disease, perish miserably in accidents, and sink with broken lives
into graves that do _not_ afford a gateway to immortal life!My God is
infinite, eternal, unchanging mind.The god of the preachers,
judging from their sermons preached here, is a human, mental
concept, embodying spirit and matter, knowing good and evil, and
changing with every caprice of their own unstable mentalities.My
religion is the Christianity of the Master, love.Oh, how this poor
world needs it, yearns for it!The love that demonstrates the
nothingness of evil, and drives it out of human experience!The love
that heals the sick, raises the dead, binds up broken hearts!The
love that will not quench the religious instincts of children, and
falsely educate them to know all manner of evil; but that teaches
them to recognize it for what it is, the lie about God, and then
shows them how to overcome it, even as Jesus did.Then all is spirit and
spirit's manifestation--is it not true?What, then, becomes of the
evil that men hug to their bosoms, even while it gnaws into their
hearts?It is the opposite of good, of mind, of truth, God.And
the opposite of truth is supposition.And you can put it out
whenever you are willing to drop your ceremonials and your theories,
and will open your mentality to truth, which will make you free,
even as the Master said.Those are
the religious views which you have been sent by Madam Elwin to
investigate.She waited a few moments for the doctor to reply.Then, as he remained
silent, she went up to him and held out her hand."You do not care to talk with me longer, I think," she said.But, as regards Madam Elwin's wishes, you may tell
her that I shall leave the school.""Have you--have you been fitting yourself for any--ah--particular
work--ah--for your support, that is?"inquired the doctor gravely, as
he took the proffered hand.He had been swept off his feet by the
girl's conversation, and he had not the temerity to combat her views."I have been working daily to gain a better
understanding of the teachings of Jesus, and through them, of God.My
single aim has been to acquire 'that mind which was in Christ Jesus.'And I have no other business than to reflect it to my fellow-men in a
life of service.That is my Father's business, and I am working with
Him.My mission in this world is to manifest God.I am going out now
to do that, and _to show what love will do_.God will use me, and He
will supply my every need.She turned abruptly from him and went to the organ.Soon the same song
which he had heard as he entered the room rose again through the
stillness.He started toward
the girl; checked himself; and stood hesitating.Then his lips set,
and he turned and walked slowly from the room.In the hall two women were approaching, and as they drew near he
recognized one of them."Why," he exclaimed with enthusiasm, holding out both hands, "my dear
Mrs.It is not so long since we met at the Weston's.But what, may I ask, brings you here?"We have come to,
make a duty call on Mr.Reed's protegee, the little South American
savage, you know.Madam Elwin said she was up here with you?""Ah, yes, quite so--er, in the chapel, I believe," said the clergyman,
his face becoming suddenly grave."I would return with you, but my
time is--ah--so limited."He bowed low, with his hand in the breast of
his long frock coat, and passed on down the hall.As the women approached the door of the chapel through which came
Carmen's low singing they turned and looked at each other inquiringly.Then they quietly entered the doorway and stood listening.Carmen,
concealed behind the organ, did not see them.Hawley-Crowles went quickly to the organ.Bending over it, she gazed down into the face of the startled girl."Get up and let me see what sort of a
looking creature you are."Reed came forward and gave her a tempered
greeting.Hawley-Crowles fell back and stared at the girl
from head to foot."You know," she said to her sister, "this is the
first glimpse I've had of your husband's discovery.I was out of the
city when he brought her to my house, you remember.But," turning
again to Carmen, "sing that song over, dear, please--the one you were
singing just now."Carmen seated herself again at the organ, and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles drew
her sister to the rear of the room."It will sound better back here,"
she explained.After the lapse of a few minutes she turned to Mrs."Belle," she
said, nodding her head sententiously, "you had a pearl, and you threw
it away.Her voice, and her
face--why, with our ward--this beautiful, gifted, South American owner
of a famous mine--as a lever, we can force the Beaubien to bring the
Ames to our terms!Meantime, the dainty Madam Elwin and the amiable Doctor Jurges in the
office below had reached a conclusion."A young lady of--ah--invincible
will," the doctor had observed; "and already--ah--decidedly mature,
despite her tender years.Should she--ah--assume leadership over the
pupils of your school, my dear Madam Elwin, the result might be
disquieting.There can be no question as to her religious views, as I
have said.But, what astonishes me is--ah--that this strange cult
should have its devotees even in the wilds of tropical America!The girl is utterly--ah--unevangelical,
Madam; and the advisability of removing her from the school can not be
questioned."By all means," asserted the latter gentleman with great seriousness,
while his eyes dwelt tenderly upon Madam Elwin's written order for a
hundred shares of Simiti stock which he held in his hand."Very well, then," said the lady with a determined nod of her head; "I
shall request Mrs.Then, with a proper sense
of what it meant to have the moral support of such an eminent divine
as Doctor Jurges, she rang for her maid and bade her summon Mrs.Thus it was that Carmen was again shifted a space on the checkerboard
of life, and slept that night once more under the spacious roof of the
wealthy relict of the late James Hawley-Crowles, on Riverside Drive.CHAPTER 7


As has been said, Carmen's six months in the Elwin school had been a
period of slow adjustment to the changed order.She had brought into
this new world a charm of unsophistication, an ingenuous _naivete_,
such as only an untrammeled spirit nourished in an elemental
civilization like that of primitive Simiti could develop.Added to
this was the zest and eagerness stimulated by the thought that she had
come as a message-bearer to a people with a great need.Her first
emotion had been that of astonishment that the dwellers in the great
States were not so different, after all, from those of her own
unprogressive country.Her next was one of sad disillusionment, as the
fact slowly dawned upon her trusting thought that the busy denizens of
her new environment took no interest whatsoever in her message.And
then her joy and brilliant hopefulness had chilled, and she awoke to
find her strange views a barrier between herself and her associates.She had brought to the America of the North a spirit so deeply
religious as to know naught else than her God and His ceaseless
manifestation.She had come utterly free of dogma or creed, and
happily ignorant of decaying formularies and religious caste.Her
Christianity was her demonstrable interpretation of the Master's
words; and her fresh, ebulliant spirit soared unhampered in the warm
atmosphere of love for mankind.Her concept of the Christ stirred no
thought within her of intolerance toward those who might hold
differing views; nor did it raise interposing barriers within her own
mind, nor evoke those baser sentiments which have so sadly warped the
souls of men into instruments of deadly hatred and crushing tyranny.Her spiritual vision, undimmed and world-embracing, saw the advent of
that day when all mankind would obey the commands of Jesus, and do the
works which he did, even to the complete spiritualization and
dematerializing of all human thought.And her burning desire was to
hasten the coming of that glad hour.The conviction that, despite its tremendous needs, humanity was
steadily rejecting, even in this great land of opportunity and
progress, the remedy for its consuming ills, came to her slowly.And
with it a damping of her ardor, and a dulling of the fine edge of her
enthusiasm.She grew quiet as the days passed, and drew away from her
companions into her thought.With her increasing sense of isolation
came at length a great longing to leave these inhospitable shores, and
return to her native environment and the sympathy and tender
solicitude of her beloved Rosendo and Padre Jose.Indeed, she could not be certain now of their
whereabouts.A great war was raging in Colombia, and she knew not what
fate had befallen her loved ones.To her many letters directed to
Simiti there had come back no reply.Even Harris, who had written
again and again to both Rosendo and Jose, had received no word from
them in return.Corroding fear began to assail the girl; soul-longing
and heart-sickness seized upon her; her happy smile faded; and her
bright, bubbling conversation ceased.Then one day, standing alone in her room, she turned squarely upon the
foul brood of evil suggestions crowding upon her and, as if they were
fell spirits from the nether world, bade them begone."I know you for what you are--_nothing_!You seemed to
use Padre Jose, but you can't use me!He is my life; and you, evil thoughts, can't make me think He isn't!I
am His image and likeness; I am His witness; and I will _not_ witness
to His opposite, evil!My life is filled with harmony; and you, evil
thoughts, can't reverse that fact!God has brought me here, else I
would not have come, for He is the cause of all that is.It is for me
to stand and see His glory.as she paced about the room and
seemed to ward off the assaults of an invisible enemy, "there is no
power apart from Him!Then, in the lull of battle, "Father divine, I thank Thee that Thou
hast heard me.And now I lay my all upon the altar of love, and throw
myself upon Thy thought."From that day, despite continued attacks from error--despite, too, the
veiled slights and covert insinuations of her schoolmates, to whom the
girl's odd views and utter refusal to share their accustomed
conversation, their interest in mundane affairs, their social
aspirations and worldly ambitions, at length made her quite
unwelcome--Carmen steadily, and without heed of diverting gesture,
brought into captivity every thought to the obedience of her
Christ-principle, and threw off for all time the dark cloud of
pessimism which human belief and the mesmerism of events had drawn
over her joyous spirit.Reed had not been near her since her enrollment in the school;
but Ketchim had visited her often--not, however, alone, but always
with one or more prospective purchasers of Simiti stock in tow whom
he sought to influence favorably through Carmen's interesting
conversation about her native land.Harris came every Sunday, and
the girl welcomed the great, blundering fellow as the coming of the
day.At times he would obtain Madam Elwin's permission to take the
girl up to the city on a little sight-seeing expedition, and then he
would abandon himself completely to the enjoyment of her naive wonder
and the numberless and often piquant questions stimulated by it.He
was the only one now with whom she felt any degree of freedom, and
in his presence her restraint vanished and her airy gaiety again
welled forth with all its wonted fervor.Once, shortly after Carmen
had been enrolled, Harris took her to a concert by the New York
Symphony Orchestra.But in the midst of the program, after sitting
in silent rapture, the girl suddenly burst into tears and begged to be
taken out.she sobbed as, outside the door,
she hid her tear-stained face in his coat; "I just couldn't!Oh, it was God that we heard--it was God!"And the
astonished fellow respected this sudden outburst of pent-up emotion
as he led her, silent and absorbed, back to the school.With the throwing of the girl upon her own thought came a rapid
expansion of both mind and body into maturity, and the young lady who
left the Elwin school that bright spring afternoon under the
protection of the self-sufficient Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was very far
from being the inquisitive, unabashed little girl who had so
greatly shocked the good Sister Superior by her heretical views
some six months before.The sophistication engendered by her
intercourse with the pupils and instructors in the school had
transformed the eager, trusting little maid, who could see only good
into a mature woman, who, though her trust remained unshaken,
nevertheless had a better understanding of the seeming power "that
lusteth against the spirit," and whose idea of her mission had been
deepened into a grave sense of responsibility.She saw now, as never
before, the awful unreality of the human sense of life; but she
likewise understood, as never previously, its seeming reality in
the human consciousness, and its terrible mesmeric power over
those materialistic minds into which the light of spirituality had as
yet scarcely penetrated.Her thought had begun to shape a definite
purpose; she was still to be a message-bearer, but the message must be
set forth in her life conduct.The futility of promiscuous verbal
delivery of the message to whomsoever might cross her path had
been made patent.She must do
likewise, and let her deeds attest the truth of her words.And from
the day that she bade the suggestions of fear and evil leave her,
she had consecrated herself anew to a searching study of the
Master's life and words, if happily she might acquire "that mind"
which he so wondrously expressed.But the assumption of an attitude of quiet demonstration was by no
means sudden.There were times when she could not restrain the impulse
to challenge the beliefs so authoritatively set forth by the preachers
and lecturers whom Madam Elwin invited to address her pupils, and who,
unlike Jesus, first taught, and then relegated their proofs to a life
beyond the grave.Once, shortly after entering the school, forgetful
of all but the error being preached, she had risen in the midst of an
eloquent sermon by the eminent Darius Borwell, a Presbyterian divine
of considerable repute, and asked him why it was that, as he seemed to
set forth, God had changed His mind after creating spiritual man, and
had created a man of dust.She had later repented her scandalous
conduct in sackcloth and ashes; but it did not prevent her from
abruptly leaving the chapel on a subsequent Sunday when another
divine, this time a complaisant Methodist, quite satisfied with his
theories of endless future rewards and fiery punishments, dwelt at
length upon the traditional idea that the sorrows of the world are
God-sent for mankind's chastisement and discipline.Then she gradually learned to be less defiant of the conventions and
beliefs of the day, and determined quietly to rise superior to them.But her experience with the preachers wrought within her a strong
determination henceforth to listen to no religious propaganda
whatsoever, to give no further heed to current theological beliefs,
and to enter no church edifice, regardless of the tenets of the sect
worshiping within its precincts.The wisdom of this decision she left
for the future to determine."Oh," she cried, "my only mission is to manifest the divine, not to
waste time listening to the theories of ignorant preachers, who fail
utterly to prove the truth of their teachings!Oh, how the world needs
love--just love!And I am going to love it with the selfless love that
comes from God, and destroys error and the false beliefs that become
externalized in the human consciousness as sickness, failure, old
age, and death!Love, love, love--it is mankind's greatest need!Why,
if the preachers only knew, the very heart and soul of Christianity is
love!It is love that casts out fear; and fear is at the bottom of all
sickness, for fear leads to belief in other gods than the one Father
of Christ Jesus!Oh, God--take me
out into the world, and let me show it what love can do!"And the divine ear heard the call of this beautiful disciple of the
Christ--aye, had heard it long before the solicitous, fluttering
little Madam Elwin decided that the strange girl's unevangelical views
were inimical to the best interests of her very select school.Hawley-Crowles threw wide the
portals of the world to Carmen, and she entered, wide-eyed and
wondering.Nor did she return until the deepest recesses of the human
mind had revealed to her their abysmal hideousness, their ghastly
emptiness of reality, and their woeful mesmeric deception.James Hawley-Crowles, more keenly perceptive than her sister, had
seized upon Carmen with avidity bred of hope long deferred.The
scourge of years of fruitless social striving had rendered her
desperate, and she would have staged a ballet on her dining table,
with her own ample self as _premiere danseuse_, did the attraction but
promise recognition from the blase members of fashionable New York's
ultra-conservative set.From childhood she had looked eagerly forward
through the years with an eye single to such recognition as life's
desideratum.To this end she had bartered both youth and beauty with
calculated precision for the Hawley-Crowles money bags; only to weep
floods of angry tears when the bargain left her social status
unchanged, and herself tied to a decrepit old rounder, whose tarnished
name wholly neutralized the purchasing power of his ill-gotten gold.Fortunately for the reputations of them both, her husband had the good
sense to depart this life ere the divorce proceedings which she had
long had in contemplation were instituted; whereupon the stricken
widow had him carefully incinerated and his ashes tenderly deposited
in a chaste urn in a mausoleum which her architect had taken oath cost
more than the showy Ames vault by many thousands.The period of
decorous mourning past, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles blithely doffed her weeds
and threw herself again into the terrific competition for social
standing, determined this time that it should be a warfare to the
death.And so it bade fair to prove to her, when the eminent nerve
specialist, Dr.Bascom Ross, giving a scant half hour to the
consideration of her case, at the modest charge of one hundred
dollars, warned her to declare a truce and flee to the Alps for
unalloyed rest.She complied, and had returned with restored health
and determination just as her sister came up from South America,
bringing the odd little "savage" whom Reed had discovered in the wilds
of Guamoco.A prolonged week-end at Newport, the last of the summer
season, accounted for her absence from the city when Reed brought
Carmen to her house, where he and his wife were making their temporary
abode.Six months later, in her swift appraisal of the girl in the
Elwin school, to whom she had never before given a thought, she seemed
to see a light."It does look like a desperate chance, I admit," she said, when
recounting her plans to her sister a day or so later."But I've played
every other card in my hand; and now this girl is going to be either a
trump or a joker.All we need is a word from the Beaubien, and the
following week will see an invitation at our door from Mrs.The trick is to reach the Beaubien.And I'm going to introduce the girl as an Inca
princess.Reed was not less ambitious than her sister, but hitherto she had
lacked the one essential to social success, money.In addition, she
had committed the egregious blunder of marrying for love.And now that
the honeymoon had become a memory, and she faced again her growing
ambition, with a struggling husband who had neither name nor wealth to
aid her, she had found her own modest income of ten thousand a year,
which she had inherited from her mother, only an aggravation.True, in
time her wandering father would pass away; and there was no doubt that
his vast property would fall to his daughters, his only living kin.But at present, in view of his aggressively good health and disregard
for his relatives, her only recourse was to attach herself to her
wealthy, sharp-witted sister, and hope to be towed safely into the
social swim, should that scheming lady ultimately achieve her high
ambition.Hawley-Crowles should have seen in Carmen a means of
reaching a woman of the stamp of the Beaubien, and through her the
leader of the most exclusive social set in the metropolis, is
difficult to say.But thus does the human mind often seek to further
its own dubious aims through guileless innocence and trust.Hawley-Crowles had likewise a slight trace of that clairvoyance
of wisdom which so characterized the girl.But with this difference,
that she knew not why she was led to adopt certain means; while
Carmen, penetrating externals, consciously sought to turn those who
would employ her into channels for the expression of her own dominant
thought.Be that as it may, the Beaubien was now the stone before the
door of their hope, and Carmen the lever by which these calculating
women intended it should be moved."The Beaubien, my dear," explained Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to her
inquisitive sister, whose life had been lived almost entirely away
from New York, "is J. Wilton Ames's very particular friend, of long
standing.As I told you, I have recently been going through my late
unpleasant husband's effects, and have unearthed letters and memoranda
which throw floods of light upon Jim's early indiscretions and his
association with both the Beaubien and Ames.Jim once told me, in a
burst of alcoholic confidence, that she had saved him from J. Wilton's
clutches in the dim past, and for that he owed her endless gratitude,
as well as for never permitting him to darken her door again.Now I
have never met the Beaubien.But I dare say she knows
all about us.However, the point that concerns us now is this: she has
a hold on Ames, and, unless rumor is wide of the truth, when she hints
to him that his wife's dinner list or yachting party seems incomplete
without such or such a name, why, the list is immediately revised."The position which the Beaubien held was, if Madam On-dit was not to
be wholly discredited, to say the least, unique.It was not as social
dictator that she posed, for in a great cosmopolitan city where polite
society is infinitely complex in its make-up such a position can
scarcely be said to exist.It was rather as an influence that she was
felt, an influence never seen, but powerful, subtle, and wholly
inexplicable, working now through this channel, now through that, and
effecting changes in the social complexion of conservative New York
that were utterly in defiance of the most rigid convention.Particularly was her power felt in the narrow circle over which Mrs.J. Wilton Ames presided, by reason of her own and her husband's
aristocratic descent, and the latter's bursting coffers and supremacy
in the realm of finance.Only for her sagacity, the great influence of the woman would have
been short-lived.But, whatever else might be said of her, the
Beaubien was wise, with a discretion that was positively uncanny.Tall, voluptuous, yet graceful as a fawn; black, wavy, abundant hair;
eyes whose dark, liquid depths held unfathomable mysteries; gracious,
affable, yet keen as a razor blade; tender, even sentimental on
occasions, with an infinite capacity for either love or hate, this
many-sided woman, whose brilliant flashes of wit kept the savant or
roue at her table in an uproar, could, if occasion required, found an
orphanage or drop a bichloride tablet in the glass of her rival with
the same measure of calculating precision and disdain of the future.It was said of her that she might have laid down her life for the man
she loved.It is probable that she never met with one worth the
sacrifice.While yet in short dresses she had fled from her boarding school, near
a fashionable resort in the New Hampshire hills, with a French
Colonel, Gaspard de Beaubien, a man twice her age.With him she had
spent eight increasingly miserable years in Paris.Then, her withered
romance carefully entombed in the secret places of her heart, she
secured a divorce from the roistering colonel, together with a small
settlement, and set sail for New York to hunt for larger and more
valuable game.With abundant charms and sang-froid for her capital, she rented an
expensive apartment in a fashionable quarter of the city, and then
settled down to business.Whether she would have fallen upon bad days
or not will never be known, for the first haul of her widespread net
landed a fish of supreme quality, J. Wilton Ames.On the plea of
financial necessity, she had gone boldly to his office with the deed
to a parcel of worthless land out on the moist sands of the New Jersey
shore, which the unscrupulous Gaspard de Beaubien had settled upon her
when she severed the tie which bound them, and which, after weeks of
careful research, she discovered adjoined a tract owned by Ames.Pushing aside office boy, clerk, and guard, she reached the inner
_sanctum_ of the astonished financier himself and offered to sell at a
ruinous figure.A few well-timed tears, an expression of angelic
innocence on her beautiful face, a despairing gesture or two with her
lovely arms, coupled with the audacity which she had shown in forcing
an entrance into his office, effected the man's capitulation.She was
then in her twenty-fourth year.The result was that she cast her net no more, but devoted herself
thenceforth with tender consecration to her important catch.In time
Ames brought a friend, the rollicking James Hawley-Crowles, to call
upon the charming Beaubien.In time, too, as was perfectly natural, a
rivalry sprang up between the men, which the beautiful creature
watered so tenderly that the investments which she was enabled to make
under the direction of these powerful rivals flourished like Jack's
beanstalk, and she was soon able to leave her small apartment and take
a suite but a few blocks from the Ames mansion.At length the strain between Ames and Hawley-Crowles reached the
breaking point; and then the former decided that the woman's
bewitching smiles should thenceforth be his alone.He forthwith drew
the seldom sober Hawley-Crowles into certain business deals, with the
gentle connivance of the suave Beaubien herself, and at length sold
the man out short and presented a claim on every dollar he possessed.Hawley-Crowles awoke from his blissful dream sober and trimmed.But
then the Beaubien experienced one of her rare and inexplicable
revulsions of the ethical sense, and a compromise had to be effected,
whereby the Hawley-Crowles fortune was saved, though the man should
see the Beaubien no more.By this time her beauty was blooming in its utmost profusion, and her
prowess had been fairly tried.She took a large house, furnished it
like unto a palace, and proceeded to throw her gauntlet in the face of
the impregnable social caste.There she drew about her a circle of
bon-vivants, artists, litterateurs, politicians, and men of
finance--with never a woman in the group.Yet in her new home she
established a social code as rigid as the Median law, and woe to him
within her gates who thereafter, with or without intent, passed the
bounds of respectful decorum.His name was heard no more on her rosy
lips.Her dinners were Lucullan in their magnificence; and over the rare
wines and imperial cigars which she furnished, her guests passed many
a tip and prognostication anent the market, which she in turn quietly
transmitted to her brokers.She came to understand the game
thoroughly, and, while it was her heyday of glorious splendor, she
played hard.She had bartered every priceless gift of nature for
gold--and she made sure that the measure she received in return was
full.Her gaze was ever upon the approaching day when those charms
would be but bitter memories; and it was her grim intention that when
it came silken ease should compensate for their loss.Ten years passed, and the Beaubien's reign continued with undimmed
splendor.In the meantime, the wife of J. Wilton Ames had reached the
zenith of her ambitions and was the acknowledged leader in New York's
most fashionable social circle.But, though
the Beaubien had never sought the entree to formal society, preferring
to hold her own court, at which no women attended, she exercised a
certain control over it through her influence upon the man Ames.Ames knew of the long-continued relations between her husband and
this woman was never divulged.And doubtless she was wholly satisfied
that his wealth and power afforded her the position which her heart
had craved; and, that secure, she was willing to leave him to his own
methods of obtaining diversion.But rumor was persistent, maliciously
so; and rumor declared that the list of this envied society dame was
not drawn up without the approval of her husband and the woman with
whom his leisure hours were invariably spent.Hawley-Crowles, whose doting mate had once fawned in the perfumed wake
of the luxurious Beaubien.Carmen, whose wishes had not been consulted, had voiced no objection
whatever to returning to the Hawley-Crowles home.Indeed, she secretly
rejoiced that an opportunity had been so easily afforded for escape
from the stifling atmosphere of the Elwin school, and for entrance
into the great world of people and affairs, where she believed the
soil prepared for the seed she would plant.That dire surprises
awaited her, of which she could not even dream, did not enter her
calculations.Secure in her quenchless faith, she gladly accepted the
proffered shelter of the Hawley-Crowles mansion, and the protection of
its worldly, scheming inmates.In silent, wide-eyed wonder, in the days that followed, the girl
strove to accustom herself to the luxury of her surroundings, and to
the undreamed of marvels which made for physical comfort and
well-being.Hawley-Crowles settled upon her seemed a fortune--enough, she thought,
to buy the whole town of Simiti!Her gowns seemed woven on fairy
looms, and often she would sit for hours, holding them in her lap and
reveling in their richness.Then, when at length she could bring
herself to don the robes and peep timidly into the great pier glasses,
she would burst into startled exclamations and hide her face in her
hands, lest the gorgeous splendor of the beautiful reflection
overpower her."Oh," she would exclaim, "it can't be that the girl reflected there
ever lived and dressed as I did in Simiti!I wonder, oh, I wonder if
Padre Jose knew that these things were in the world!"And then, as she leaned back in her chair and gave herself into the
hands of the admiring French maid, she would close her eyes and dream
that the fairy-stories which the patient Jose had told her again and
again in her distant home town had come true, and that she had been
transformed into a beautiful princess, who would some day go in search
of the sleeping priest and wake him from his mesmeric dream.Then would come the inevitable thought of the little newsboy of
Cartagena, to whom she had long since begun to send monetary
contributions--and of her unanswered letters--of the war devastating
her native land--of rudely severed ties, and unimaginable changes--and
she would start from her musing and brush away the gathering tears,
and try to realize that her present situation and environment were but
means to an end, opportunities which her God had given her to do His
work, with no thought of herself.A few days after Carmen had been installed in her new home, during
which she had left the house only for her diurnal ride in the big
limousine, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles announced her readiness to fire the
first gun in the attack upon the Beaubien."My dear," she said to her
sister, as they sat alone in the luxurious sun-parlor, "my washerwoman
dropped a remark the other day which gave me something to build on.Her two babies are in the General Orphan Asylum, up on Twenty-third
street.Well, it happens that this institution is the Beaubien's sole
charity--in fact, it is her particular hobby.I presume that she feels
she is now a middle-aged woman, and that the time is not far distant
when she will have to close up her earthly accounts and hand them over
to the heavenly auditor.Anyway, this last year or two she has
suddenly become philanthropic, and when the General Orphan Asylum was
building she gave some fifty thousand dollars for a cottage in her
name.What's more, the trustees of the Asylum accepted it without the
wink of an eyelash."But here's the point: some rich old fellow has willed the institution
a fund whose income every year is used to buy clothing for the
kiddies; and they have a sort of celebration on the day the duds are
given out, and the public is invited to inspect the place and the
inmates, and eat a bit, and look around generally.Well, my
washerwoman tells me that the Beaubien always attends these annual
celebrations.The next one, I learn, comes in about a month.I propose
that we attend; take Carmen; ask permission for her to sing to the
children, and thereby attract the attention of the gorgeous Beaubien,
who will be sure to speak to the girl, who is herself an orphan, and,
ten to one, want to see more of her.I'll have a
word to say regarding our immense debt of gratitude to her for saving
Jim's fortune years ago when he was entangled in her net--and, well,
if that scheme doesn't work, I have other strings to my bow."But it did work, and with an ease that exceeded the most sanguine
hopes of its projector.On the day that the General Orphan Asylum
threw wide its doors to the public, the Hawley-Crowles limousine
rubbed noses with the big French car of the Beaubien in the street
without; while within the building the Beaubien held the hand of the
beautiful girl whose voluntary singing had spread a veil of silence
over the awed spectators in the great assembly room, and, looking
earnestly down into the big, trusting, brown eyes, said: "My dear
child, I want to know you."Then, turning to the eager, itching Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I shall send my car for her to-morrow afternoon, with
your permission."Hawley-Crowles wildly hugged her
sister and the girl all the way home--then went to bed that night with
tears of apprehension in her washed-out eyes, lest she had shown
herself too eager in granting the Beaubien's request.But her fears
were turned to exultation when the Beaubien car drew up at her door
the following day at three, and the courteous French chauffeur
announced his errand.A few moments later, while the car glided
purring over the smooth asphalt, Carmen, robed like a princess, lay
back in the cushions and dreamed of the poor priest in the dead little
town so far away.CHAPTER 9


"Sing it again, dear.I know you are tired, but I want to hear that
song just once more.Somehow it seems to bring up thoughts of--of
things that might have been."The Beaubien's voice sank to a whisper
as she finished.Carmen laughed happily and prepared to repeat the weird lament which
had so fascinated the Reverend Doctor Jurges a few days before."I--I don't know why that song affects me so," mused the Beaubien,
when the girl had finished and returned to the seat beside her.Then,
abruptly: "I wish you could play the pipe-organ out in the hall.I put
twelve thousand dollars into it, and I can't even play five-finger
exercises on it."exclaimed Carmen, drawing a long breath,
while her eyes dilated."Well, you poor, unsophisticated girl, suppose we just go down there
and buy the whole town.It would at least give me an interest in life.Do you think I could stand the heat there?How did you live, and what did you do?And are
you really descended from the old Incas?"They were alone in the darkened music room, and the soft-stepping,
liveried butler had just set the tea table before them, At one end of
the long room a cheery fire snapped and crackled in the huge
fireplace, tempering the sharpness of the early spring day and casting
a ruddy glow upon the tapestried walls and polished floor in front,
where dozed the Beaubien's two "babies," Japanese and Pekingese
spaniels of registered pedigree and fabulous value.Among the heavy
beams of the lofty ceiling grotesque shadows danced and flickered,
while over the costly rugs and rare skins on the floor below subdued
lights played in animated pantomime.Behind the magnificent grand
piano a beautifully wrought harp reflected a golden radiance into the
room.Everything in the woman's environment was softened into the same
degree of voluptuousness which characterized her and the life of
sybaritic ease which she affected.From the moment Carmen entered the house she had been charmed,
fascinated, overpowered by the display of exhaustless wealth and
the rich taste exhibited in its harmonious manifestation.The
Hawley-Crowles home had seemed to her the epitome of material
elegance and comfort, far exceeding the most fantastic concepts of her
childish imagination, when she had listened enraptured to Padre
Jose's compelling stories of the great world beyond Simiti.But the
gorgeous web of this social spider made even the Hawley-Crowles
mansion suffer in comparison."And yet," said the amused Beaubien, when Carmen could no longer
restrain her wonder and admiration, "this is but a shed beside the new
Ames house, going up on Fifth Avenue.I presume he will put not less
than ten millions into it before it is finished."Carmen dared not attempt to grasp the
complex significance of such an expenditure."Why, is that such a huge amount, child?"asked the Beaubien, as
accustomed to think in eight figures as in two."But, I forget that
you are from the jungle.she mused, gazing
with undisguised admiration at the beautiful, animated girl before
her.Carmen was struggling with the
deluge of new impressions; and the woman fastened her eyes upon her as
if she would have them bore deep into the soul of whose rarity she was
becoming slowly aware.What thoughts coursed through the mind of the
Beaubien as she sat studying the girl through the tempered light, we
may not know.What she saw in Carmen that attracted her, she herself
might not have told.Had she, too, this ultra-mondaine, this creature
of gold and tinsel, felt the spell of the girl's great innocence and
purity of thought, her righteousness?Or did she see in her something
that she herself might once have been--something that all her gold,
and all the wealth of Ormus or of Ind could never buy?"What have you got," she suddenly, almost rudely, exclaimed, "that I
haven't?"And then the banality of the question struck her, and she
laughed harshly."Why," said Carmen, looking up quickly and beaming upon the woman,
"you have everything!"You," returned the woman quickly, though she knew not why she said
it.And yet, memory was busy uncovering those bitter days when, in the
first agony of marital disappointment, she had, with hot, streaming
tears, implored heaven to give her a child.But the gift had been
denied; and her heart had shrunk and grown heavily calloused.Then she spoke more gently, and there was that in her voice which
stirred the girl's quick sympathy."Yes, you have youth, and beauty.But I could part with them, gladly, if only
there were anything left."Carmen instantly rose and went swiftly to her.Forgetful of caste,
decorum, convention, everything but the boundless love which she felt
for all mankind, she put her arms about the worldly woman's neck and
kissed her.For a moment the Beaubien sat in speechless surprise.It was the only
manifestation of selfless love that had ever come into her sordid
experience.that it was an
act of real sympathy, and not a clever ruse to win her from behind the
mask of affection?Her own kisses, she knew, were bestowed only for
favors.they drew not many now, although time was when a single
one might win a brooch or a string of pearls.The girl herself quickly met the woman's groping thought."I'm in the
world to show what love will do," she murmured; "and I love you."Had
she not thus solved every problem from earliest childhood?Not even a heart of stone could withstand the
solvent power of such love.Her head dropped upon her breast, and she
wept."Don't cry," said Carmen, tenderly caressing the bepowdered cheek."Why, we are all God's children; we all have one another; you have me,
and I have you; and God means us all to be happy."The Beaubien looked up, wondering.Her variegated life included no
such tender experience as this.She had long since ceased to shed
aught but tears of anger.But now--

She clutched the girl to her and kissed her eagerly; then gently
motioned her back to her chair."Don't mind it," she smiled, with
swimming eyes, and a shade of embarrassment."I don't know of anything
that would help me as much as a good cry.If I could have had a
daughter like you, I should--but never mind now."She tried to laugh,
as she wiped her eyes.Then an idea seemed to flash through her jaded brain, and she became
suddenly animated."Why--listen," she said; "don't you want to learn
the pipe-organ?I will pay for
them; I will engage the best teacher in New York; and you shall take
two or three a week, and use the big organ out in the hall.Carmen's heart gave a great leap."I'll do it myself," returned the woman with growing enthusiasm."William," she directed, when the butler responded to her summons,
"get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles on the wire at once.But who is coming, I
wonder?"glancing through the window at an automobile that had drawn
up at her door.a look of vexation mantling her face, "the
Right Reverend Monsignor Lafelle.Well," turning to Carmen, "I suppose
I'll have to send you home now, dear.Hawley-Crowles
that I shall call for you to-morrow afternoon, and that I shall speak
to her at that time about your music lessons.William, take Monsignor
into the morning room, and then tell Henri to bring the car to the
porte-cochere for Miss Carmen.Good-bye, dear," kissing the bright,
upturned face of the waiting girl."I wish I could--but, well, don't
forget that I'm coming for you to-morrow."Hawley-Crowles directed her French tailor to cable
to Paris for advance styles.Twenty-four hours later she hastened with
outstretched arms to greet the Beaubien, waiting in the reception
room.Oh, yes, they had heard often of each other; and now were so
pleased to meet!New York was such a whirlpool, and it was so
difficult to form desirable friendships.Yes, the Beaubien had known
the late-lamented Hawley-Crowles; but, dear!that was years and
years ago, before he had married, and when they were both young and
foolish.Hawley-Crowles, chance enabled him and me to be mutually
helpful at a time when I was in sore need of a friend; and the debt of
gratitude is not yours to me, but mine to your kind husband."Hawley-Crowles could have hugged her on the spot.What cared she
that her husband's always unsavory name had been linked with this
woman's?She had married the roistering blade for his bank account
only.Any other male whose wealth ran into seven figures would have
done as well, or better.Hawley-Crowles gratefully
accepted the use of the organ and the Beaubien mansion for the girl;
but she herself insisted upon bearing the expense of the lessons.Together, she and the Beaubien,
they would foster and develop it.Moreover, though of course this must
follow later, she intended to give the girl every social advantage
befitting her beauty, her talents, and her station.And then, when the Beaubien, who knew to a second just how long to
stay, had departed, taking Carmen with her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles turned
to her sister with her face flushed with anger.she exclaimed, while hot tears suffused her eyes."The hussy went away
actually laughing at me!What do you suppose she's got up her sleeve?But, let me tell you, she'll not fool me!I'll slap that arrogant Ames
woman yet; and then, when I've done that, I'll give the Beaubien
something to think about besides the way she did up poor old Jim!"*       *       *       *       *

There was now but one cloud that cast its dark shadow across the full
splendor of Carmen's happiness, the silence that shrouded Simiti.But
Harris was preparing to return to Colombia, and his trip promised a
solution of the mystery of her unanswered letters.For weeks Carmen
had struggled to teach him Spanish, with but small measure of success."You'll have to go back with me and
act as interpreter," he said one day, when they were alone in the
Hawley-Crowles parlor.Then a curious light came into his eyes, and he
blurted, "Will you?"But the girl turned the question aside with a laugh, though she knew
not from what depths it had sprung.Harris shrugged his broad
shoulders and sighed.He had not a hundred dollars to his name.Yet he had prospects, not the least of which was the interest he
shared with Reed in La Libertad.For, despite the disturbed state of
affairs in Colombia, Simiti stock had sold rapidly, under the sedulous
care of Ketchim and his loyal aids, and a sufficient fund had been
accumulated to warrant the inauguration of development work on the
mine.A few years hence Harris should be rich from that source alone.Reed was still in California, although the alluring literature which
Ketchim was scattering broadcast bore his name as consulting engineer
to the Simiti Development Company.His wife had continued her
temporary abode in the Hawley-Crowles mansion, while awaiting with
what fortitude she could command the passing of her still vigorous
father, and the results of her defiant sister's assaults upon the Ames
set.The wonderful organ in the Beaubien
mansion had cast a spell of enchantment over her soul, and daily she
sat before it, uncovering new marvels and losing herself deeper and
deeper in its infinite mysteries.Her progress was commensurate with
her consecration, and brought exclamations of astonishment to the lips
of her now devoted Beaubien.Hour after hour the latter would sit in
the twilight of the great hall, with her eyes fastened upon the
absorbed girl, and her leaden soul slowly, painfully struggling to
lift itself above the murk and dross in which it had lain buried for
long, meaningless years.They now talked but little, this strange
woman and the equally strange girl.Their communion was no longer of
the lips.It was the silent yearning of a dry, desolate heart,
striving to open itself to the love which the girl was sending far and
wide in the quenchless hope that it might meet just such a need.For
Carmen dwelt in the spirit, and she instinctively accepted her
splendid material environment as the gift, not of man, but of the
great divine Mind, which had led her into this new world that she
might be a channel for the expression of its love to the erring
children of mortals.She came and went quietly, and yet with as much confidence as if the
house belonged to her.At first the Beaubien smiled indulgently.And
then her smile became a laugh of eager joy as she daily greeted her
radiant visitor, whose entrance into the great, dark house was always
followed by a flood of sunshine, and whose departure marked the
setting in of night to the heart-hungry woman.In the first days of
their association the Beaubien could turn easily from the beautiful
girl to the group of cold, scheming men of the world who filled her
evenings and sat about her board.But as days melted into weeks, she
became dimly conscious of an effort attaching to the transition; and
the hour at length arrived when she fully realized that she was facing
the most momentous decision that had ever been evolved by her worldly
mode of living.But that was a matter of slow development through many
months.Hawley-Crowles trod the clouds.A week after Carmen
began the study of the organ she boldly ventured to accompany her one
day to the Beaubien citadel.She was graciously received, and departed
with the Beaubien's promise to return the call.Thereupon she set
about revising her own social list, and dropped several names which
she now felt could serve her no longer.Her week-end at Newport, just
prior to her visit to the Elwin school, had marked the close of the
gay season in the city, and New York had entered fully upon its summer
_siesta_.Even the theaters and concert halls were closed, and the
metropolis was nodding its weary head dully and sinking into
somnolence.The
summer interim would give her time to further her plans and prepare
the girl for her social _debut_ in the early winter."And Milady Ames
will be mentioned in the papers next day as assisting at the
function--the cat!"she muttered savagely, as she laid aside her
revised list of social desirables.But in preparing Carmen that summer for her subsequent entry into
polite society Mrs.Hawley-Crowles soon realized that she had
assumed a task of generous proportions.In the first place,
despite all efforts, the girl could not be brought to a proper
sense of money values.Her eyes were ever gaping in astonishment at
what Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister regarded as the most moderate
of expenditures, and it was only when the Beaubien herself mildly
hinted to them that ingenuousness was one of the girl's greatest
social assets, that they learned to smile indulgently at her wonder,
even while inwardly pitying her dense ignorance and lack of
sophistication.A second source of trial to her guardians was her delicate sense of
honor; and it was this that one day nearly sufficed to wreck their
standing with the fashionable Mrs.Gannette of Riverside Drive, a
pompous, bepowdered, curled and scented dame, anaemic of mind, but
tremendously aristocratic, and of scarcely inferior social dignity to
that of the envied Mrs.Gannette moved into the
neighborhood where dwelt the ambitious Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the latter
was taken by a mutual acquaintance to call upon her, and was
immediately received into the worldly old lady's good graces.And it
so happened that, after the gay season had closed that summer, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister to an informal
afternoon of bridge, and especially requested that they bring their
young ward, whose beauty and wonderful story were, through the
discreet maneuvers of her guardians, beginning to be talked about.Hawley-Crowles had been inducting Carmen
into the mysteries of the game; but with indifferent success, for the
girl's thoughts invariably were elsewhere engaged.On this particular
afternoon Carmen was lost in contemplation of the gorgeous dress, the
lavish display of jewelry, and the general inanity of conversation;
and her score was pitiably low.The following morning, to her great
astonishment, she received a bill from the practical Mrs.Gannette for
ten dollars to cover her losses at the game.For a long time the
bewildered girl mused over it.Then she called the chauffeur and
despatched him to the Gannette mansion with the money necessary to
meet the gambling debt, and three dollars additional to pay for the
refreshments she had eaten, accompanying it with a polite little note
of explanation.The result was an explosion that nearly lifted the asphalt from the
Drive; and Carmen, covered with tears and confusion, was given to
understand by the irate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles that her conduct was as
reprehensible as if she had attacked the eminent Mrs.Whereupon the sorrowing Carmen packed her effects and prepared to
depart from the presence of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, to the terrified
consternation of the latter, who alternately prostrated herself before
the girl and the offended Mrs.Gannette, and at length, after many
days of perspiring effort and voluminous explanation, succeeded in
restoring peace.When the Beaubien, who had become the girl's confidante, learned the
story, she laughed till her sides ached.And then her lips set, and
her face grew terribly hard, and she muttered, "Fools!"But she smiled
again as she gathered the penitent girl in her arms, and kissed her."You will learn many things, dearie, before you are through with New
York.And," she added, her brow again clouding, "you _will_ be through
with it--some day!"That evening she repeated the story at her table, and Gannette, who
happened to be present, swore between roars of laughter that he would
use it as a club over his wife, should she ever again trap him in any
of his numerous indiscretions.Again, the girl's odd views of life and its meaning which, despite her
efforts, she could not refrain from voicing now and then, caused the
worldly Mrs.Hawley-Crowles much consternation.Carmen tried
desperately to be discreet.Even Harris advised her to listen much,
but say little; and she strove hard to obey.But she would forget and
hurl the newspapers from her with exclamations of horror over their
red-inked depictions of mortal frailty--she would flatly refuse to
discuss crime or disease--and she would comment disparagingly at too
frequent intervals on the littleness of human aims and the emptiness
of the peacock-life which she saw manifested about her."I don't
understand--I can't," she would say, when she was alone with the
Beaubien."Why, with the wonderful opportunities which you rich people
have, how can you--oh, how can you toss them aside for the frivolities
and littleness that you all seem to be striving for!It seems to me
you must be mad--_loco_!And I know you are, for you are simply
mesmerized!"Then the Beaubien would smile knowingly and take her in her arms."We
shall see," she would often say, "we shall see."Thus the summer months sped swiftly past, with Carmen ever looking and
listening, receiving, sifting, in, but not of, the new world into
which she had been cast.In a sense her existence was as narrowly
routined as ever it had been in Simiti, for her days were spent at the
great organ, with frequent rides in the automobile through the parks
and boulevards for variation; and her evenings were jealously guarded
by Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose policy was to keep the girl in seclusion
until the advent of her formal introduction to the world of
fashionable society, when her associates would be selected only from
the narrow circle of moneyed or titled people with whom alone she
might mingle.To permit her to form promiscuous acquaintances now
might prove fatal to the scheming woman's cherished plans, and was a
risk that could not be entertained.And Carmen, suppressing her
wonder, and striving incessantly to curb her ready tongue, accepted
her environment as the unreal expression of the human mind, and
submitted--and waited.CHAPTER 10

The chill blasts had begun to swoop down from the frozen North, and
summer had gathered her dainty robes about her and fled shivering
before them.Hawley-Crowles stood at a window and gazed with
unseeing eyes at the withered leaves tossing in the wind.Carmen's sixteenth birthday was past by some months; the gay season
was at hand; and the day was speeding toward her which she had set for
the girl's formal _debut_.Already, through informal calls and
gatherings, she had made her charming and submissive ward known to
most of her own city acquaintances and the members of her particular
set.The fresh, beautiful girl's winning personality; her frank,
ingenuous manner; her evident sincerity and her naive remarks, which
now only gave hints of her radical views, had opened every heart wide
to her, and before the advent of the social season her wonderful story
was on everybody's tongue.There remained now only the part which the
woman had planned for the Beaubien, but which, thus far, she had found
neither the courage nor the opportunity to suggest to that influential
woman.Gazing out into the deserted street, she stamped her ample foot
in sheer vexation.The Beaubien had absorbed Carmen; had been
politely affable to her and her sister; had called twice during the
summer; and had said nothing.The
hint must come from the other side; and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles could have
wept with chagrin as she reflected gloomily on her own timorous
spirit.But as she stood in dejection before the window a vague idea flitted
into her brain, and she clutched at it desperately.Carmen had spoken
of the frequent calls of a certain Monsignor Lafelle at the Beaubien
mansion, although the girl had never met him."Old Gaspard de Beaubien was a
French Catholic."Nothing--except--why, to be sure,
the girl came from a Catholic country, and therefore was a Catholic!That was worth developing a little
further."Let us see," she reflected, "Kathleen Ames is coming out
this winter, too.Candidate for her mother's
social position, of course.The Reverend Darius Borwell, D.D., L.L.D., and any other D. that will
keep him glued to his ten-thousand-dollar salary, hooked them early in
the game.Now suppose--suppose Lafelle should tell the Beaubien
that--that there's--no, that won't do!But suppose I tell him that
here's a chance for him to back a Catholic against a Protestant for
the highest social honors in New York--Carmen versus Kathleen--what
would he say?I'm just as good a Catholic as Protestant.And Catholic, Methodist, or Hard-shell
Baptist, as suited his needs.Suppose I should tip
it off to Lafelle that I'm smitten with the pious intention of
donating an altar to Holy Saints Cathedral in memory of my late,
unlamented consort--what then?Yes,
it's not a bad idea at all."And thus it was that a few days later Mrs.Hawley-Crowles timed it so
carefully that she chanced to call on the Beaubien with Carmen shortly
after Monsignor Lafelle's car had pulled up at the same door.It was
the merest accident, too, that Carmen led her puffing guardian
directly into the morning room, where sat the Beaubien and Monsignor
in earnest conversation.Hawley-Crowles would have retired at
once, stammering apologies, and reprimanding Carmen for her assumption
of liberties in another's house; but the Beaubien was grace and
cordiality itself, and she insisted on retaining her three callers and
making them mutually acquainted.Hawley-Crowles found it easy to take
the contemplated plunge.Therefore she smiled triumphantly when, a
week later, Monsignor Lafelle alighted at her own door, in response to
a summons on matters pertaining to the Church."But, Madam," replied the holy man, after carefully listening to her
announcement, "I can only refer the matter to the Bishop.I am not
connected with this diocese.But I
shall be most pleased to lay it before him, with my endorsement.""As you say, Monsignor," sweetly responded the gracious Mrs."I sought your advice because I had met you through my
dear friend, Madam Beaubien.""It has been a great pleasure to know you and to be of service to you,
Madam," said Monsignor, rising to depart."But," he added with a
tender smile, "a pleasure that would be enhanced were you to become
one of us."Hawley-Crowles knew that at last the time had come."A moment,
please, Monsignor," she said, her heart beating quickly.It concerns my ward, the young girl
whom you met at Madam Beaubien's.""And just
budding into still more beautiful womanhood."Then she threw herself precipitately into her
topic, as if she feared further delay would result in the evaporation
of her boldness."Monsignor, it is, as you say, unfortunate that I
profess no religious convictions; and yet, as I have told you, I find
that as the years pass I lean ever more strongly toward your Church.Now you will pardon me when I say that I am sure it is the avowed
intention to make America dominantly Catholic that brings you to this
country to work toward that end--is it not so?"The man's handsome face lighted up pleasantly, but he did not reply."Now, Monsignor, I am going to be terribly frank; and if you
disapprove of what I suggest, we will both forget that the matter was
ever under discussion.To begin with, I heartily endorse your
missionary efforts in this godless country of ours.Nothing but the
strong arm of the Catholic Church, it seems to me, can check our
headlong plunge into ruin.But, Monsignor, you do not always work
where your labors are most needed.You may control political--"

"My dear lady," interrupted the man, holding up a hand and shaking his
head in gentle demurral, "the Catholic Church is not in politics.""But it is in society--or should be!""And
if the Catholic Church is to be supreme in America it must work from
the top down, as well as from the lower levels upward.At present our
wealthiest, most influential social set is absolutely domineered by a
Protestant--and under the influence of a Presbyterian minister at
that!Monsignor Lafelle's eyes twinkled, as he listened politely.But he
only stroked the white hair that crowned his shapely head, and
waited."Monsignor," continued the now thoroughly heated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles,
"why do not the women of your Church constitute our society leaders?Why do you not recognize the desirability of forcing your people into
every avenue of human activity?And would you resent a suggestion from
me as to how in one instance this might be accomplished?""Certainly not, Madam," replied Monsignor, with an expression of
wonder on his face."You are laughing at me, I do believe!"she exclaimed, catching the
glint in his gray eyes."Pardon me, dear lady, I really am deeply interested."Well, at any rate I have your promise to forget this conversation if
you do not approve of it," she said quizzically.He nodded his head to inspire her confidence; and she continued:

"Very well, now to the point.My ward, the little Inca princess, is
coming out shortly.I want her to have the _entree_ into the very best
society, into the most fashionable and exclusive set, as befitting her
rank."She stopped and awaited the effect of her words.Monsignor studied her for a moment, and then broke into a genial
laugh."There is nothing reprehensible in your wish, Madam," he said."Our social system, however imperfect, nevertheless exists,
and--dominant Catholic influence might improve it."Why, I really see nothing that I can do," he replied slowly.Hawley-Crowles was becoming exasperated with his apparent
dullness."You can do much," she retorted in a tone tinctured with
impatience."Since I have made you my Father Confessor to-day, I am
going to tell you that I intend to start a social war that will rip
this city wide open.It is going to be war in which Catholic is pitted
against Protestant.For a moment her blunt question startled him, and he stared at her
uncomprehendingly; but he quickly recovered his poise and replied
calmly, "Neither, Madam; it remains quite neutral.""Pardon me if I say it; not at all."she murmured, her eagerness subsiding."Then I've made an awful
mistake!""No," he amended gently, "you have made a good friend.And, as such, I
again urge you first to respect the leaning which you mentioned a
moment ago and become actively affiliated with our Church here in New
York."Certainly I will consider it," she responded, brightening with hope."And I will go so far as to say that I have long had it in mind.""Then, Madam, when that is accomplished, we may discuss the less
important matter of your ward's entrance into society--is it not so?"Hawley-Crowles rose, completely discomfited."But the girl,
Monsignor, is already a Catholic--comes from a Catholic country.It is
she whom I am pitting against the Protestant.""You are cruel," she retorted, affecting an air of injured innocence
as she stood before him with downcast eyes."But--if you--"

"Madam," said Monsignor, "plainly, what is it that you wish me to
do?"The sudden propounding of the question drew an equally sudden but less
thoughtful response."Tell the Beau--Madam Beaubien that you wish my ward to be received
into the best society, and for the reasons I have given you."And is my influence with Madam Beaubien, and hers with the members of
fashionable society, sufficient to effect that?"he asked, an odd look
coming into his eyes."She has but to say the word to J. Wilton Ames, and his wife will
receive us both," said the woman, carried away by her eagerness."And
that means strong Catholic influence in New York's most aristocratic
set!""Monsignor," continued the woman eagerly, "will your Church receive an
altar from me in memory of my late husband?"Then, slowly, and in a low, earnest tone, "It
would receive such a gift from one of the faith.When may we expect
you to become a communicant?"The woman paled, and her heart suddenly chilled.She had wondered how
far she might go with this clever churchman, and now she knew that she
had gone too far.But to retract--to have him relate this conversation
and her retraction to the Beaubien--were fatal!She had set her
trap--and walked into it.Then,
raising her eyes and meeting his searching glance, she murmured
feebly, "Whenever you say, Monsignor."When the man had departed, which he did immediately, the plotting
woman threw herself upon the davenport and wept with rage."Belle,"
she wailed, as her wondering sister entered the room, "I'm going to
join the Catholic Church!But I'd go through Sheol to beat that Ames
outfit!"CHAPTER 11


MONSIGNOR LAFELLE made another afternoon call on the Beaubien a few
days later.That lady, fresh from her bath, scented, powdered, and
charming in a loose, flowing Mandarin robe, received him graciously."But I can give you only a moment, Monsignor," she said, waving him to
a chair, while she stooped and tenderly took up the two spaniels."I
have a dinner to-night, and so shall not listen unless you have
something fresh and really worth while to offer.""My dear Madam," said he, bowing low before he sank into the great
leather armchair, "you are charming, and the Church is justly proud of
you.""Tut, tut, my friend," she returned, knitting her brows."That may be
fresh, I admit, but not worth listening to.And if you persist in that
vein I shall be obliged to have William set you into the street.""I can not apologize for voicing the truth, dear Madam," he replied,
as his eyes roved admiringly over her comely figure."The Church has
never ceased to claim you, however far you may have wandered from her.I am leaving for Canada shortly on a mission of
some importance.May I not take with me the consoling assurance that
you have at last heard and yielded to the call of the tender Mother,
who has never ceased to yearn for her beautiful, wayward daughter?""There," she said gently, "I thought
that was it.No, Monsignor, no," shaking her head."When only a wild,
thoughtless girl I became a Catholic in order that I might marry
Gaspard de Beaubien.The priest urged; and I--<DW30>!But
the past eighteen years have confirmed me in some views; and one is
that I shall gain nothing, either here or hereafter, by renewing my
allegiance to the Church of Rome."Monsignor sighed, and stroked his abundant white hair."I learned this morning," he said musingly, "that my
recent labors with the Dowager Duchess of Altern in England have not
been vain.She has become a communicant of Holy Church.""The Duchess of Altern--sister of Mrs.Why, she was a high Anglican--"

"Only a degree below the true Church, Madam.Her action is but
anticipatory of a sweeping return of the entire Anglican Church to the
true fold.And I learn further," he went on, "that the Duchess will
spend the winter in New York with her sister.Which means, of course,
an unusually gay season here, does it not?"The Beaubien quickly recovered from her astonishment."Well,
Monsignor," she laughed, "for once you really are interesting.Ames herself will be the next
convert?But one of your most intimate friends will
become a communicant of Holy Saints next Sunday."The Beaubien set the spaniels down
on the floor."Now, my dear Monsignor, you are positively refreshing."Am I not right when I insist that you have
wandered far, dear Madam?It is not 'he,' but'she,' your dear friend,
Mrs.The Beaubien's mouth opened wide and she sat suddenly upright and
gazed blankly at her raconteur.The man went on, apparently oblivious
of the effect his information had produced."Her beautiful ward, who
is to make her bow to society this winter, is one of us by birth.""Then you have been at work on Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward, have
you?"said the Beaubien severely, and there was a threatening note in
her voice."Why," returned Monsignor easily, "the lady sent for me to express her
desire to become affiliated with the Church.And I
have had no conversation with the girl, I assure you."Then:

"Will you tell me why, Monsignor, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles takes this
unusual step?"Is it unusual, Madam, for a woman who has seen much of the
world to turn from it to the solace and promise of the Church?"Hawley-Crowles it
is, decidedly."Monsignor, I do not.And by this time you
do, too.She is the last woman in the world to turn from it.""But the question you have just propounded reflects seriously upon
both the Church and me--"

"Bah!"interjected the Beaubien, her eyes flashing."Wait," she
commanded imperiously, as he rose."I have a few things to say to you,
since this is to be your last call.""Madam, not the last, I hope.For I shall not cease to plead the cause
of the Church to you--"

"Surely, Monsignor, that is your business.You are welcome in my
house at any time, and particularly when you have such delightful
scraps of gossip as these which you have brought to-day.But, a word
before you go, lest you become indiscreet on your return.Hawley-Crowles to any extent you wish, but let her ward
alone--_absolutely_!The cold, even tone in which the woman said this left no doubt in the
man's mind of her meaning.She was not trifling with him now, he knew.In her low-voiced words he found no trace of banter, of sophistry, nor
of aught that he might in any wise misinterpret."Now, Monsignor, I have some influence in New York, as you may
possibly know.Will you admit that I can do much for or against you?Drop your mask, therefore, and tell me frankly just what has induced
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to unite with your Church."The man knew he was pitting his own against a master mind.He
hesitated and weighed well his words before replying."Madam," said he
at length, with a note of reproach, "you misjudge the lady, the
Church, and me, its humble servant.Hawley-Crowles, I speak truly when I say that doubtless she
has been greatly influenced by love for her late husband."The Beaubien half rose from her chair."Jim Crowles--that raw,
Irish boob, who was holding down a job on the police force until Ames
found he could make a convenient tool of him!The man who was
Gannette's cat's-paw in the Fall River franchise steal!Now,
Monsignor, would you have me believe you devoid of all sense?""But," ejaculated the man, now becoming exasperated, and for the
moment so losing his self-control as to make wretched use of his
facts, "she is erecting an altar in Holy Saints as a memorial to
him!"Monsignor Lafelle again made as if to rise.He felt that he was guilty
of a miserable _faux pas_."Madam, I regret that I must be leaving.But the hour--"

"Stay, Monsignor!"The Beaubien roused up and laid a detaining hand
upon his arm."Our versatile friend, what other projects has she in
hand?"Why, really, I can not say--beyond the fact that the girl is to be
introduced to society this winter."Going to make a try for the Ames set?""That, I believe, Madam, would be useless without your aid."Hawley-Crowles say so, Monsignor?"demanded the woman,
leaning forward eagerly."Why, I believe I am not abusing her confidence when I say that she
intimated as much," he said, watching her closely and sparring now
with better judgment.Ames as New York's
fashionable society leader--"

"There is no such position as leader in New York society, Monsignor,"
interrupted the Beaubien coldly."There are sets and cliques, and
Mrs.Ames happens to be prominent in the one which at present
foolishly imagines it constitutes the upper stratum.Hawley-Crowles, with nothing but a tarnished name and a large bank
account to recommend her, now wishes to break into that clique and
attain social leadership, does she?Then the woman's eyes narrowed and grew hard.Leaning closer to
the churchman, she rested the tip of her finger on his knee."So, Monsignor," she said, with cold precision, "this is Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's method of renouncing the world, is it?And she would use both you and me, eh?And you are her ambassador
at the court of the Beaubien?Very well, then, she shall use us.But you and I will first make this compact, my dear Monsignor:
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles shall be taken into the so-called 'Ames set,'
and you shall cease importuning me to return to your Church, and
what is more, shall promise to have no conversation on church
matters with her ward, the young girl.If you do not agree to
this, Monsignor, I shall set in motion forces that will make your
return to New York quite undesirable."When she concluded, she
looked long and steadily into his eyes.Monsignor got slowly to his feet.he exclaimed in a hoarse
whisper, "my astonishment--"

"There," she said calmly, as she rose and took his hand, "please omit
the dramatics, Monsignor.And now you must go, for to-night I
entertain, and I have already given you more time than I intended.But, Monsignor, do you in future work with or against me?"Why, Madam," he replied quickly, "we could never be the latter!""And you always respect the wishes of a friend, especially if she is a
lady, do you not?""Always, Madam," he returned after a moment's hesitation, as he bowed
low over her hand.And, Monsignor," she added, when he reached the door,
"I shall be pleased to attend the dedication of the Hawley-Crowles
altar."When Monsignor's car glided away from her door the Beaubien's face
grew dark, and her eyes drew to narrow slits."So," she reflected, as
she entered the elevator to mount to her dressing room, "that is her
game, is it?The poor, fat simpleton has no interest in either the
girl or myself, other than to use us as stepping-stones.She forgets
that a stone sometimes turns under the foot.She entered her room and rang for her maid.Turning to the pier glass,
she threw on the electric light and scrutinized her features narrowly."It's going," she murmured, "fast!Oh, what a farce life is--what a howling, mocking farce!No--that little girl--if it is possible
for me to love, I love her.""I wonder what it is she does to me.I'm
hypnotized, I guess.Anyhow, I'm different when I'm with her.And to
think that Hawley-Crowles would sacrifice the child--humph!But, if
the girl is made of the right stuff--and I know she is--she will stand
up under it and be stronger for the experience.She has got something
that will make her stand!I once asked her what she had that I didn't,
and now I know--it is her religion, the religion that Borwell and
Lafelle and the whole kit of preachers and priests would corrupt if
they had half a chance!Very well, we'll see what it does under the
test.If it saves her, then I want it myself.But, as for that little
pin-headed Hawley-Crowles, she's already signed her own death-warrant.She shall get into the Ames set, yes.And I will use her, oh,
beautifully!to pay off certain old scores against Madam Ames--and
then I'll crush her like a dried leaf, the fat fool!"The Beaubien's position was, to say the least, peculiar, and one which
required infinite tact on her part to protect.It was for that reason
that the decorum which prevailed at her dinners was so rigidly
observed, and that, whatever the moral status of the man who sat at
her board, his conduct was required to be above reproach, on penalty
of immediate ejection from the circle of financial pirates, captains
of commercial jugglery, and political intriguers who made these feasts
opportunities for outlining their predatory campaigns against that
most anomalous of creatures, the common citizen.It was about this table, at whose head always sat the richly gowned
Beaubien, that the inner circle of financial kings had gathered almost
nightly for years to rig the market, determine the price of wheat or
cotton, and develop mendacious schemes of stock-jobbery whose golden
harvests they could calculate almost to a dollar before launching.As
the wealth of this clique of financial manipulators swelled beyond all
bounds, so increased their power, until at last it could be justly
said that, when Ames began to dominate the Stock Exchange, the
Beaubien practically controlled Wall Street--and, therefore, in a
sense, Washington itself.But always with a tenure of control
dubiously dependent upon the caprices of the men who continued to pay
homage to her personal charm and keen, powerful intellect.At the time of which we speak her power was at its zenith, and she
could with equal impunity decapitate the wealthiest, most aristocratic
society dame, or force the door of the most exclusive set for any
protegee who might have been kept long years knocking in vain, or
whose family name, perchance, headed a list of indictments for gross
peculations.At these unicameral meetings, held in the great, dark,
mahogany-wainscoted dining room of the Beaubien mansion, where a
single lamp of priceless workmanship threw a flood of light upon the
sumptuous table beneath and left the rest of the closely guarded room
shrouded in Stygian darkness, plans were laid and decrees adopted
which seated judges, silenced clergymen, elected senators, and
influenced presidents.There a muck-raking, hostile press was muffled.There business opposition was crushed and competition throttled.There
tax rates were determined and tariff schedules formulated.There
public opinion was disrupted, character assassinated, and the
death-warrant of every threatening reformer drawn and signed.In a
word, there Mammon, in the _role_ of business, organized and
unorganized, legitimate and piratical, sat enthroned, with wires
leading into every mart of the world, and into every avenue of human
endeavor, be it social, political, commercial, or religious.These
wires were gathered together into the hands of one man, the directing
genius of the group, J. Wilton Ames.Over him lay the shadow of the
Beaubien.An hour after the departure of Monsignor Lafelle the Beaubien, like a
radiant sun, descended to the library to greet her assembled guests.Some moments later the heavy doors of the great dining room swung
noiselessly open, and the lady proceeded unescorted to her position at
the head of the table.At her signal the half dozen men sat down, and
the butler immediately entered, followed by two serving men with the
cocktails and the first course.The chair at the far end of the table,
opposite the Beaubien, remained unoccupied."Ames is late to-night," observed the girthy Gannette, glancing toward
the vacant seat, and clumsily attempting to tuck his napkin into his
collar.The Beaubien looked sharply at him."Were you at the club this
afternoon, Mr.Gannette straightened up and became rigid.Pulling the napkin down
hastily, he replied in a thick voice, "Just a little game of
bridge--some old friends--back from Europe--"

The Beaubien turned to the butler.Gannette is not
drinking wine this evening."The butler bowed and removed the glasses
from that gentleman's place."Now, Lucile--" he began peevishly.The Beaubien held up a hand.Gannette glowered and sank down in his
chair like a swollen toad."May be Ames is trying to break into the C. and R. directors'
meeting," suggested Weston, himself a director in a dozen companies,
and a bank president besides."They tell me," said Fitch, "that for once Ames has been outwitted,
and that by a little bucket-shop broker named Ketchim."queried Kane, Board of Trade plunger, and the most
mettlesome speculator of the group."Why," explained Weston, "some months ago Ames tried to reach Ed.Stolz through Ketchim, the old man's nephew, and get control of C. and
R. But friend nephew dropped the portcullis just as Ames was dashing
across the drawbridge, and J. Wilton found himself outside, looking
through the bars.First time I've ever known that to happen.Now the
boys have got hold of it on 'Change, and Ames has been getting it from
every quarter.""Long time leaking out, seems to me," remarked Kane."But what's Ames
going to do about it?""He seems to have dropped the
matter.""I think you will find yourself mistaken," put in the Beaubien
evenly.queried Fitch, as all eyes turned upon the woman.Ames always gets what he goes
after, and he will secure control of C. and R.vigorously asserted Murdock, who had been an
interested listener."I have one thousand dollars that says he will," said the Beaubien,
calmly regarding the speaker.Murdock seemed taken back for the moment; but lost no time recovering
his poise.Drawing out his own book he wrote a check in the Beaubien's
name for the amount and sent it down the table to her.Fitch will hold the stakes," said the woman, handing him the two
slips of paper."And we will set a time limit of eighteen months.""By the way," remarked Peele, the only one of the group who had taken
no part in the preceding conversation, "I see by the evening paper
that there's been another accident in the Avon mills.Fellow named
Marcus caught in a machine and crushed all out of shape.That's the
third one down there this month.They'll force Ames to equip his mills
with safety devices if this keeps up.""Not while the yellow metal has any influence upon the Legislature,"
returned the Beaubien with a knowing smile."But," she added more
seriously, "that is not where the danger lies.The real source of
apprehension is in the possibility of a strike.And if war breaks out
among those Hungarians down there it will cost him more than to equip
all his mills now with safety devices."Gannette, who had been sulking in his chair, roused up."Speaking
of war," he growled, "has Ames, or any of you fellows, got a
finger in the muddle in South America?I've got interests down
there--concessions and the like--and by--!"He wandered off into
incoherent mutterings.The Beaubien gave a sharp command to the butler.cried Gannette, his apoplectic face becoming
more deeply purple, and his blear eyes leering angrily upon the calm
woman."I ain't a-goin' to stand this!I'm as sober
as any one here, an'--" William took the heavy man gently by the arm
and persuaded him to his feet.The other guests suppressed their
smiles and remained discreetly quiet."Have Henri take him to his club, William," said the Beaubien, rising.We will expect you Wednesday evening, and
we trust that we will not have to accept your excuses again."Gannette was led soddenly out.The Beaubien quietly resumed her seat.It was the second time the man had been dismissed from her table, and
the guests marveled that it did not mean the final loss of her favor.But she remained inscrutable; and the conversation quickly drifted
into new channels.A few moments later William returned and made a
quiet announcement:

"Mr.A huge presence emerged from the darkness into the light.The Beaubien
immediately rose and advanced to greet the newcomer.she
whispered, taking his hand.The man smiled down into her upturned, anxious face.His only reply
was a reassuring pressure of her hand.But she comprehended, and her
face brightened."Gentlemen," remarked Ames, taking the vacant chair, "the President's
message is out.I have been going over it with Hood--which accounts
for my tardiness," he added, nodding pleasantly to the Beaubien."Quoting from our chief executive's long list of innocent platitudes,
I may say that 'private monopoly is criminally unjust, wholly
indefensible, and not to be tolerated in a Republic founded upon the
premise of equal rights to all mankind.'"concurred Weston, holding up his glass and gazing
admiringly at the rich color of the wine."Quite my sentiments, too," murmured Fitch,
rolling his eyes upward and attempting with poor success to assume a
beatific expression."Furthermore," continued Ames, with mock gravity, "the interlocking of
corporation directorates must be prohibited by law; power must be
conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission to superintend the
financial management of railroads; holding-companies must cease to
exist; and corrective policies must be shaped, whereby so-called
'trusts' will be regulated and rendered innocuous."We are," said they all, in one voice."Carried," concluded Ames in a solemn tone.Then a burst of laughter
rose from the table; and even the inscrutable William smiled behind
his hand."But, seriously," said Weston, when the laughter had ceased, "I
believe we've got a President now who's going to do something, don't
you?""As long as the human mind
remains as it is there is nothing to fear, though Congress legislate
itself blue in the face.Reform is not to be made like a garment and
forced upon the people from the outside.Restrictive measures have not as yet, in all the history of
civilization, reformed a single criminal.""That we are puncture-proof," replied Ames with a light laugh."But what about your indictment in that cotton deal?Is Hood going to
find you law-proof there?""The case is settled," said Ames easily."I went into court this
morning and plead guilty to the indictment for conspiring to corner
the cotton market two years ago.I admitted that I violated the
Sherman law.The judge promptly fined me three thousand dollars, for
which I immediately wrote a check, leaving me still the winner by some
two million seven hundred thousand dollars on the deal, to say nothing
of compound interest on the three thousand for the past two years.You
see the beneficent effect of legislation, do you not?""By George, Ames, you certainly were stingy not to let us in on that!""Cotton belongs to me, gentlemen," replied Ames simply."Well," remarked Fitch, glancing about the table, "suppose we get down
to the business of the evening--if agreeable to our hostess," bowing
in the direction of the Beaubien."Has any one
anything new to offer?""There is a little
matter," he began, "that I have been revolving for some days.It occurred to
me some time ago that a franchise for a trolley line on that road
could be secured and ultimately sold for a round figure to the wealthy
residents whose estates lie along it, and who would give a million
dollars rather than have a line built there.After some preliminary
examination I got Hood to draft a bill providing for the building of
the road, and submitted it to Jacobson, Commissioner of Highways.He
reported that it would be the means of destroying the post road.I
convinced him, on the other hand, that it would be the means of lining
his purse with fifty thousand dollars.So he very naturally gave it
his endorsement.I then got in consultation with Senator Gossitch, and
had him arrange a meeting with the Governor, in Albany.I think," he
concluded, "that about five hundred thousand dollars will grease the
wheels all 'round.I've got the Governor on the hip in that Southern
Mexican deal, and he is at present eating out of my hand.I'll lay
this project on the table now, and you can take it up if you so
desire.""The scheme seems all right," commented Weston, after a short
meditation."Well, a net profit of half a million to split up among us would at
least provide for a yachting party next summer," remarked Ames
sententiously."And no work connected with it--in fact, the work has
been done.I shall want an additional five per cent for handling it."An animated discussion followed; and then Fitch offered a motion that
the group definitely take up the project.The Beaubien put the vote,
and it was carried without dissent."What about that potato scheme you were figuring on, Ames?"asked
Fitch at this juncture."I didn't get much encouragement from my
friends," he replied."I don't believe it," put in Weston emphatically."I have one million dollars that says it could," returned Ames calmly.Weston threw up his hands in token of surrender.he
exclaimed, scurrying for cover."Well," he said, "suppose we look into the scheme and
see if we don't want to handle it.It simply calls for a little
thought and work.He stopped and glanced at the Beaubien for approval.She nodded, and
he went on:

"I have lately been investigating the subject of various food supplies
other than wheat and corn as possible bases for speculation, and my
attention has been drawn strongly to a very humble one, potatoes."But Ames continued
unperturbed:

"I find that in some sections of the West potatoes are so plentiful at
times that they bring but twenty cents a bushel.My investigations
have covered a period of several months, and now I have in my
possession a large map of the United States with the potato sections,
prices, freight rates and all other necessary data indicated.My idea is to send agents into all these
sections next summer before the potatoes are turned up, and contract
for the entire crop at twenty-five cents a bushel.The agents will pay
the farmers cash, and agree to assume all expenses of digging,
packing, shipping, and so forth, allowing the farmer to take what he
needs for his own consumption.Needless to say, the potatoes will not
be removed from the fields, but will be allowed to rot in the ground.Those that do reach the market will sell for a dollar and a half in
New York and Chicago.""In other words," added Fitch, "you are simply figuring to corner the
market for the humble tuber, eh?""But--you say you have all the necessary data now?""All, even to the selection of a few of my agents.I can control
freight rates for what we may wish to ship.The rest of the crop will
be left to rot.And the
consumers will pay our price for what they must have.""And how much do you figure we shall
need to round the corner?""A million, cash in hand," replied Ames."Is this anything that the women can mix into?""You know they forced us to dump tons of our cold-storage stuff onto
the market two years ago.""That was when I controlled wheat," said Ames, "and was all tied up.It will be done so quietly
and thoroughly that it will all be over and the profits pocketed
before the women wake up to what we're doing.In this case there will
be nothing to store.And potatoes exposed in the field rot quickly,
you know."The rest of the group seemed to study the idea for some moments.Then
the practical Murdock inquired of Ames if he would agree to handle the
project, provided they took it up."Yes," assented Ames, "on a five per cent basis.And I am ready to put
agents in the field to-morrow.""Then, Madam Beaubien," said Fitch, "I move that we adopt the plan as
set forth by Mr.Ames, and commission him to handle it, calling upon
us equally for whatever funds he may need."A further brief discussion ensued; and then the resolution was
unanimously adopted."Say, Ames," queried Weston, with a glint of mischief in his eyes,
"will any of these potatoes be shipped over the C. and R.?"A laugh
went up around the table, in which Ames himself joined."Yes," he
said, "potatoes and cotton will both go over that road next summer,
and I shall fix the rebates."suggested Fitch, with a wink at
Murdock.Ames's mouth set grimly, and the smile left his face."Ketchim is
going to Sing Sing for that little deal," he returned in a low, cold
tone, so cold that even the Beaubien could not repress a little
shudder."I had him on Molino, but he trumped up a new company which
absorbed Molino and satisfied everybody, so I am blocked for the
present.But, mark me, I shall strip him of every dollar, and then put
him behind the bars before I've finished!"And no one sought to refute the man, for they knew he spoke truth.At midnight, while the cathedral chimes in the great hall clock were
sending their trembling message through the dark house, the Beaubien
rose, and the dinner was concluded.A few moments later the guests
were spinning in their cars to their various homes or clubs--all but
Ames.As he was preparing to leave, the Beaubien laid a hand on his
arm."Wait a moment, Wilton," she said."I have something important to
discuss with you."She led him into the morning room, where a fire was
blazing cheerily in the grate, and drew up a chair before it for him,
then nestled on the floor at his feet."I sent Gannette home this evening," she began, by way of introduction.I would drop him entirely, only you said--"

"We need him," interrupted Ames."I'll soil my hands by doing it; but it is for you.Now tell me," she
went on eagerly, "what about Colombia?Have you any further news from
Wenceslas?"The Church is
with the Government, and they will win--although your money may be
tied up for a few years.Still, you can't lose in the end."The woman sat for some moments gazing into the fire.Then:

"Lafelle was here again to-day.""Hold him, too," said Ames quickly."Looks as if I had made you a sort
of holding company, doesn't it?""But we
shall have good use for these fellows.""He gave me some very interesting news," she said; and then went on to
relate the conversation in detail.Ames laughed loudly as he
listened."And now, Wilton," said the Beaubien, a determined look
coming into her face, "you have always said that you never forgave me
for making you let Jim Crowles off, when you had him by the throat.Well, I'm going to give you a chance to get more than even.Jim's fat
widow is after your wife's scalp.I intend that she shall lose her own
in the chase.I've got my plans all laid, and I want your wife to meet
the lovely Mrs.Hawley-Crowles at the Fitch's next Thursday afternoon.It will be just a formal call--mutual introductions--and, later, an
invitation from Mrs.Meantime, I want you
to get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles involved in a financial way, and shear her
of every penny!"My dear," said he, taking her hand, "you are charming this
evening.she deprecated, although the smile she gave him
attested her pleasure in the compliment."Well," she continued
briskly, "if I'm so beautiful, you can't help loving me; and if you
love me, you will do what I ask."Really,
I've long since forgotten him.Do you realize that that was more than
ten years ago?""Please don't mention years, dear," she murmured, shuddering a little."Tell me, what can we do to teach this fat hussy a lesson?""Well," he suggested, laughing, "we might get Ketchim after her, to
sell her a wad of his worthless stocks; then when he goes down, as he
is going one of these days, we will hope that it will leave her on the
rocks of financial ruin, eh?""Why, among other innocent novelties, a scheme bearing the sonorous
title of Simiti Development Company, I am told by my brokers."Why--I've heard Carmen mention that name.I wonder--"

"Well, and who is Carmen?""My little friend--the one and only honest person I've ever dealt
with, excepting, of course, present company."And now where does this Carmen enter the
game?""Why, she's--surely you know about her!""Well, she is a little Colombian--"

"Colombian!"Came up with the engineers who
went down there for Ketchim to examine the Molino properties.She
lived all her life in a town called Simiti until she came up here."Ames leaned over and looked steadily into the fire."Never heard of
the place," he murmured dreamily."Well," said the Beaubien eagerly, "she's a--a wonderful child!I'm
different when I'm with her."He roused from his meditations and smiled down at the woman."Then I'd
advise you not to be with her much, for I prefer you as you are."Then the woman looked up at her
companion.The man started; then drew himself up and gave a little nervous laugh."Of you," he replied evasively, "always."She reached up and slapped his cheek tenderly."You were dreaming of
your awful business deals," she said."What have you in hand
now?--besides the revolution in Colombia, your mines, your mills, your
banks, your railroads and trolley lines, your wheat and potato
corners, your land concessions and cattle schemes, and--well, that's a
start, at least," she finished, pausing for breath.I'm buying every bale I can find, in Europe, Asia, and
the States.""But, Will, you've been caught in cotton before, you know.And I don't
believe you can get away with it again.Unless--"

"That's it--unless," he interrupted."And that's just the part I have
taken care of.The cotton schedule will go
through as I have it outlined.They
don't dare refuse to pass the measure.In a few
months the tariff on cotton products will be up.The new tariff-wall
sends the price of raw stuff soaring.I
was beaten on the last deal simply because of faulty weather
prognostications.I'll let you in, if you wish.But these other fellows have got
to stay out.""I haven't a penny to invest, Will," she replied mournfully."You got
me so terribly involved in this Colombian revolution.""Oh, well," he returned easily, "I'll lend you what you need, any
amount.And you can give me your advice and suggestions from time to
time.As for your Colombian investments, haven't I guaranteed them,
practically?""Not in writing," she said, looking up at him with a twinkle in her
eyes."No, certainly not," she returned, giving him a glance of admiration.Hawley-Crowles is going to be received into your
wife's set, and you are going to give her a good financial whipping?"Hawley-Crowles
shall go to the poor-house, if you say the word.But now, my dear,
have William order my car.Hawley-Crowles at Fitch's?"Yes, dear," murmured the Beaubien, reaching up and kissing him; "next
Thursday at three.Call me on the 'phone to-morrow."CHAPTER 12


The Ames building, a block from the Stock Exchange, was originally
only five stories in height.But as the Ames interests grew, floor
after floor was added, until, on the day that Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
pointed it out to Carmen from the window of her limousine, it had
reached, tower and all, a height of twenty-five stories, and was
increasing at an average rate of two additional a year.It was not its
size that aroused interest, overtopped as it was by many others, but
its uniqueness; for, though a hive of humming industry, it did not
house a single business that was not either owned outright or
controlled by J. Wilton Ames, from the lowly cigar stands in the
marble corridors to the great banking house of Ames and Company on the
second floor.The haberdashers, the shoe-shining booths, the soda
fountains, and the great commercial enterprises that dwelt about them,
each and all acknowledged fealty and paid homage to the man who
brooded over them in his magnificent offices on the twenty-fifth floor
in the tower above.It was not by any consensus of opinion among the financiers of New
York that Ames had assumed leadership, but by sheer force of what
was doubtless the most dominant character developed in recent
years by those peculiar forces which have produced the American
multimillionaire."And," he once added, when, despite his anger, he could
not but admire Ames's tactical blocking of his piratical move, which
the former's keen foresight had perceived threatened danger at
Washington, "it is not by any tacit agreement that we accept him,
but because he knows ten tricks to our one, that's all."To look at the man, now in his forty-fifth year, meant, generally, an
expression of admiration for his unusual physique, and a wholly
erroneous appraisal of his character.His build was that of a
gladiator.He stood six-feet-four in height, with Herculean shoulders
and arms, and a pair of legs that suggested nothing so much as the
great pillars which supported the facade of the Ames building.Those
arms and legs, and those great back-muscles, had sent his college
shell to victory every year that he had sat in the boat.They had won
every game on the gridiron in which he had participated as the
greatest "center" the college ever developed.For baseball he was a
bit too massive, much to his own disappointment, but the honors he
failed to secure there he won in the field events, and in the
surreptitiously staged boxing and wrestling bouts when, hidden away in
the cellar of some secret society hall, he would crush his opponents
with an ease and a peculiar glint of satisfaction in his gray eyes
that was grimly prophetic of days to come.His mental attitude toward
contests for superiority of whatever nature did not differ essentially
from that of the Roman gladiators: he entered them to win.If he fell,
well and good; he expected "thumbs down."If he won, his opponent need
look for no exhibition of generosity on his part.When his man lay
prone before him, he stooped and cut his throat.And he would have
loathed the one who forbore to do likewise with himself.In scholarship he might have won a place, had not the physical side of
his nature been so predominant, and his remarkable muscular strength
so great a prize to the various athletic coaches and directors.Ames
was first an animal; there was no stimulus as yet sufficiently strong
to arouse his latent spirituality.And yet his intellect was keen; and
to those studies to which he was by nature or inheritance especially
attracted, economics, banking, and all branches of finance, he brought
a power of concentration that was as stupendous as his physical
strength.His mental make-up was peculiar, in that it was the epitome
of energy--manifested at first only in brute force--and in that it was
wholly deficient in the sense of fear.Because of this his daring was
phenomenal.Immediately upon leaving college Ames became associated with his
father in the already great banking house of Ames and Company.But the
animality of his nature soon found the confinement irksome; his
father's greater conservatism hampered his now rapidly expanding
spirit of commercialism; and after a few years in the banking house he
withdrew and set up for himself.The father, while lacking the boy's
fearlessness, had long since recognized dominant qualities in him
which he himself did not possess, and he therefore confidently
acquiesced in his son's desire, and, in addition, gave him _carte
blanche_ in the matter of funds for his speculative enterprises.Four years later J. Wilton Ames, rich in his own name, already
becoming recognized as a power in the world of finance, with
diversified enterprises which reached into almost every country of the
globe, hastened home from a foreign land in response to a message
announcing the sudden death of his father.The devolving of his
parent's vast fortune upon himself--he was the sole heir--then
necessitated his permanent location in New York.And so, reluctantly
giving up his travels, he gathered his agents and lieutenants about
him, concentrating his interests as much as possible in the Ames
building, and settled down to the enjoyment of expanding his huge
fortune.A few months later he married, and the union amalgamated the
proud old Essex stock of Ames, whose forbears fought under the
Conqueror and were written in the Doomsday Book, to the wealthy and
aristocratic Van Heyse branch of old Amsterdam.To this union were
born a son and a daughter, twins.The interval between his graduation from college and the death of his
father was all but unknown to the cronies of his subsequent years in
New York.Though he had spent much of it in the metropolis, he had
been self-centered and absorbed, even lonely, while laying his plans
and developing the schemes which resulted in financial preeminence.With unlimited money at his disposal, he was unhampered in the choice
of his business clientele, and he formed it from every quarter of the
globe.Much of his time had been spent abroad, and he had become as
well known on the Paris bourse and the exchanges of Europe as in his
native land.Confident and successful from the outset; without any
trace of pride or touch of hauteur in his nature; as wholly lacking in
ethical development and in generosity as he was in fear; gradually
becoming more sociable and companionable, although still reticent of
certain periods of his past; his cunning and brutality increasing with
years; and his business sagacity and keen strategy becoming the talk
of the Street; with no need to raise his eyes beyond the low plane of
his material endeavors; he pursued his business partly for the
pleasure the game afforded him, partly for the power which his
accumulations bestowed upon him, and mostly because it served as an
adequate outlet for his tremendous, almost superhuman, driving energy.If he betrayed and debauched ideals, it was because he was utterly
incapable of rising to them, nor felt the stimulus to make the
attempt.If he achieved no noble purpose, it was because when he
glanced at the mass of humanity about him he looked through the lenses
of self.His glance fell always first upon J. Wilton Ames--and he
never looked beyond.The world had been created for him; the cosmos
but expressed his Ego.On the morning after his conversation with the Beaubien regarding the
social aspirations of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the financier sat at his
rich mahogany desk on the top floor of the Ames building in earnest
discussion with his lawyer, Alonzo Hood.The top floor of the tower
was divided into eight rooms.Two of these constituted Ames's inner
_sanctum_; one was Hood's private office; and the rest were devoted
to clerks and stenographers.A telegrapher occupied an alcove
adjoining Hood's room, and handled confidential messages over
private wires to the principal cities in the country.A private
telephone connected Ames's desk with the Beaubien mansion.Private
lines ran to the Stock Exchange and to various other points
throughout the city.The telegraph and telephone companies gave his
messages preference over all others.At a word he would be placed in
almost instant communication with New Orleans, San Francisco, London,
Berlin, or Cairo.Private lines and speaking tubes ran to every room
or floor of the building where a company, firm, or individual was
doing business.At the office of the Telegraph Service up-town he
maintained messengers who carried none but his own despatches.In
the railroad yards his private car stood always in readiness; and in
the harbor his yacht was kept constantly under steam.A motor car
stood ever in waiting in the street below, close to the shaft of a
private automatic elevator, which ran through the building for his
use alone.This elevator also penetrated the restaurant in the
basement of the building, where a private room and a special waiter
were always at the man's disposal.A private room and special
attendant were maintained in the Turkish baths adjoining, and he
had his own personal suite and valet at his favorite club up-town.This morning he was at his desk, as usual, at eight o'clock.Before
him lay the various daily reports from his mines, his mills, his
railroads, and his bank.These disposed of, there followed a quick
survey of the day's appointments, arranged for him by his chief
secretary.As the latter entered, Ames was
absorbed in the legend of the stock ticker."C. and R. closed yesterday at twenty-six," he commented.Then,
swinging back in his chair, "What's Stolz doing?""For one thing, he has made Miss Fagin his private stenographer,"
replied Hood."Now we will begin to get real information," he
remarked."Tell Miss Fagin you will give her fifty dollars a week from
now on; but she is to deliver to you a carbon copy of every letter she
writes for Stolz.And I want those copies on my desk every morning
when I come down.Hood," he continued, abruptly turning the
conversation, "what have you dug up about Ketchim's new company?""Very little, sir," replied Hood with a trace of embarrassment."His
lawyer is a fledgeling named Cass, young, but wise enough not to talk.I called on him yesterday afternoon to have a little chat about the
old Molino company, representing that I was speaking for certain
stockholders.But he told me to bring the stockholders in and he would
talk with them personally."Ames laughed, while the lawyer grinned sheepishly."Is that the sort
of service you are rendering for a hundred-thousand-dollar salary?""Hood, I'm ashamed of you!""I can't blame you; I am ashamed of myself," replied the lawyer."Well," continued Ames good-naturedly, "leave Ketchim to me.I've got
three men now buying small amounts of stock in his various companies.I'll call for receiverships pretty soon, and we will see this time
that he doesn't refund the money.Now about other matters: the Albany
post trolley deal is to go through.Work up
the details and let me have them at once.Have you got the senate bill
drawn for Gossitch?"As it stands now, the repealing
section gives any city the right to grant saloon licenses of
indefinite length, instead of for one year."We want the bill so drawn that it will become
practically impossible to revoke a license.""As it now reads," said Hood, "it makes a saloon license assignable.That creates a property right that can hardly be revoked.""As I figure, it will create a value of some
twenty millions for those who own saloons in New York.And if the United States ever reaches the point
where it will have to buy the saloons in order to wipe them out, it
will face a very handsome little expenditure."Ames, a very large part of the stock of American brewing
companies is owned in Europe.How are you--"

"Nominally, it is.But for two years, and more, I have been quietly
gathering in brewing stock from abroad, and to-day I have some ten
millions in my own control, from actual purchases, options, and so
forth.I'm going to organize a holding company, when the time arrives,
and I figure that within the next year or so we will practically
control the production of beer and spirituous liquors in the United
States and Europe.The formation of that company will be a task worthy
of your genius, Hood.""It will be a pleasure to undertake it," replied Hood with animation.Ames, I got in touch with Senator Mall last evening
at the club, and he assures me that the senate committee have so
changed the phraseology of the tariff bill on cotton products that the
clause you wish retained will be continued with its meaning unaltered.In fact, the discrimination which the hosiery interests desire will be
fully observed.Your suggestion as to an ad valorem duty of fifty per
cent on hose valued at less than sixty-five cents a dozen pairs is
exceptionally clever, in view of the fact that there are none of less
than that value.""Triumphant Republicanism," he commented."And
right in the face of the President's message.Wire Mall that I will be
in Washington Thursday evening to advise with him further about it.Hood, we've got a fight on in regard to
the President's idea of granting permission in private suits to use
judgments and facts brought out and entered in government suits
against combinations.And the
regulation of security issues of railroads--preposterous!If Mall and Gossitch and Wells don't oppose
that in the Senate, I'll see that they are up before the lunacy
commission--and I have some influence with that body!""There is nothing to fear, I think," replied Hood reassuringly."An
important piece of business legislation like that will hardly go
through this session.And then we will have time to prepare to
frustrate it.The suggestion to place the New York Stock Exchange
under government supervision is a much more serious matter, I think.""See here, Hood," said Ames, leaning forward and laying a hand upon
that gentleman's knee, "when that happens, we'll have either a
Socialist president or a Catholic in the White House, with Rome
twitching the string.Then I shall move to my Venezuelan estates, take
the vow of poverty, and turn monk.""Which reminds me again that by your continued relations with Rome you
are doing much to promote just that state of affairs," returned the
lawyer sententiously."But I find the Catholic Church
convenient--indeed, necessary--for the promotion of certain plans.But I shall
abruptly sever my relations with that institution some day--when I am
through with it.At present I am milking the Church to the extent of a
brimming pail every year; and as long as the udder is full and
accessible I shall continue to tap it.I tapped the Presbyterian
Church, through Borwell, last year, if you remember."Willett, chief secretary to Ames, entered at that moment with the
morning mail, opened and sorted, and replies written to letters of
such nature as he could attend to without suggestions from his chief."By the way," remarked Hood when he saw the letters, "I had word from
Collins this morning that he had secured a signed statement from that
fellow Marcus, who was crushed in the Avon mills yesterday.Marcus
accepted the medical services of our physicians, and died in our
hospital.Just before he went off, his wife accepted a settlement of
one hundred dollars.Looked big to her, I guess, and was a bird in the
hand."That reminds me," said Ames, looking up from his mail; "we are going
to close the mills earlier this year on account of the cotton
shortage.""Four thousand hands idle for three months, I suppose.we just escaped disaster last year, you remember.""It will be more than three months this time," commented Ames with a
knowing look.Then--"Hood, I verily believe you are a coward."Ames," replied the latter slowly, "I certainly would
hesitate to do some of the things you do.Yet you seem to get away
with them.""Perk up, Hood," laughed Ames."I've got real work for you as soon as
I get control of C. and R. I'm going to put you in as president, at a
salary of one hundred thousand per annum.Then you are going to buy
the road for me for about two million dollars, and I'll reorganize and
sell to the stockholders for five millions, still retaining control.The road is only a scrap heap, but its control is the first step
toward the amalgamation of the trolley interests of New England.Laws
are going to be violated, Hood, both in actual letter and in spirit.It's up to you to get around the
Interstate Commerce Commission in any way you can, and buttress this
little monopoly against competition and reform-infected legislatures."We'll send Crabbe to the Senate," Ames coolly replied."You seem to forget that senators are now elected by the people, Mr.The people are New York City, Buffalo, and
Albany.And Tammany at present is in my pocket.Buffalo and Albany can be swept by the Catholic vote.And I have that
in the upper right hand drawer of my private file.The 'people' will
therefore elect to the Senate the man I choose.In fact, I prefer
direct election of senators over the former method, for the people are
greater fools _en masse_ than any State Legislature that ever
assembled."He took up another letter from the pile on his desk and glanced
through it."Protests against the way
you nullified the Glaze-Bassett red-light injunction bill.I really didn't think it was in you."said Hood, puffing a little with
pride.But for that, the passage of the bill would have wiped out the
whole red-light district, and quartered the rents I now get from my
shacks down there.Now next year we will be better prepared to fight
the bill.The press will be with us then--a little cheaper and a
trifle more degraded than it is to-day."Ames read it and handed
it to his lawyer."The _Proteus_ has reached the African Gold Coast at
last," he said.Then he threw back his head and laughed heartily."Do
you know, Hood, the _Proteus_ carried two missionaries, sent to the
frizzle-topped Zulus by Borwell and his outfit.Deutsch and Company
cable that they have arrived.""But," said Hood in some perplexity, "the cargo of the _Proteus_ was
rum!""Just so," roared Ames; "that's where the joke comes in.I make it a
point that every ship of mine that carries a missionary to a foreign
field shall also carry a cargo of rum.The combination is one that the
Zulu finds simply irresistible!""So," commented Hood, "the Church goes down to Egypt for help!""I carry the missionaries free on my rum
boats.Great saving to the Board of Foreign Missions, you know."Hood looked at the man before him in undisguised admiration of his
cunning."And did you likewise send missionaries to China with your
opium cargoes?""I once sent Borwell himself to Hongkong on a boat
loaded to the rails with opium.We had insisted on his taking a needed
vacation, and so packed him off to Europe.In Bombay I cabled him to
take the _Crotus_ to Hongkong, transportation free.That was my last
consignment of opium to China, for restrictions had already fallen
upon our very Christian England, and the opium traffic was killed.I
had plans laid to corner the entire opium business in India, and I'd
have cleaned up a hundred million out of it, but for the pressure of
public sentiment.However, we're going to educate John Chinaman to
substitute whiskey for opium.But now," glancing at the great electric
wall clock, "I've wasted enough time with you.By the way, do you know
why this Government withheld recognition of the Chinese Republic?""No," replied Hood, standing in anticipation."Thirty thousand chests of opium," returned Ames laconically."Ames and Company had advanced to the English banks of Shanghai and
Hongkong half this amount, loaned on the opium.That necessitated a
few plain words from me to the President, and a quick trip from
Washington to London afterwards to interview his most Christian
British Majesty.A very pleasant and profitable trip, Hood, very!Hood threw his chief another look of intense admiration, and left the
room."Get Lafelle here some time to-day when I have a vacant hour,"
commanded Ames."Cable to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, of Cartagena, and
ask him if an American mining company is registered there under the
name of Simiti Development Company, and what properties they have and
where located.Tell him to cable reply, and follow with detailed
letter."He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes."The Congregation of
the Sacred Index has laid the ban on--what's the name of the book?"He
drew out a card-index drawer and selected a card, which he tossed to
the secretary.He seemed to
muse a while, then went on slowly."Carlos Madero, of Mexico, is in
New York.Learn where he is staying, and arrange an interview for me.Wire Senator Wells, Washington, that the bill for a Children's Bureau
must not be taken from the table.Wire the Sequana Coal
Company that I want their report to-morrow, without fail.Wire
Collins, at Avon, to tell the Spinners' Union I have nothing to
discuss with them.As Hood was chief of the Ames legal department, and Willett the chief
of his army of secretaries, so Hodson was the captain of his force of
brokers, a keen, sagacious trader, whose knowledge of the market and
whose ability in the matter of stock trading was almost uncanny."What's your selection for to-day, Hodson?"asked Ames, as the man
entered.Hodson laid on his desk three lists of suggested deals on the
exchanges of New York, London, and Paris.Ames glanced over them
hurriedly, drawing his pencil through certain that did not meet his
approval, and substituting others in which for particular reasons he
wished to trade that morning."What's your reason for thinking I ought
to buy Public Utilities?""They have the letting of the Hudson river tunnel contract," replied
Hodson.Ames studied the broker's face a moment.Then his own brightened, as
he began to divine the man's reason.he ejaculated, "you
think there's quicksand along the proposed route?""I know it," said Hodson calmly."Pick up ten thousand shares, if you can get them," returned Ames
quickly.Then--"I'm going to attend a meeting of the Council of
American Grain Exchanges at two to-day.I want you to be just outside
the door."Ames concluded, "I guess that's all.I'm at the bank at ten; at the Board of Trade at ten-thirty; Stock
Exchange at eleven; and lunch at Rector's at twelve sharp, returning
here immediately afterward."Hodson again bowed, and left the office to undertake his various
commissions.For the next half hour Ames pored over the morning's quota of letters
and messages, making frequent notes, and often turning to the
telephone at his hand.Then he summoned a stenographer and rapidly
dictated a number of replies."In my next vacant hour, following the one devoted to Lafelle, I want
to see Reverend Darius Borwell," he directed."Also," he continued,
"wire Strunz that I want a meeting of the Brewers' Union called at the
earliest possible date.By the way, ask Lafelle if he can spend the
night with me on board the _Cossack_, and if so, notify Captain
McCall.Here is a bundle of
requests for charity, for contributions to hospitals, orphan asylums,
and various homes.'Phone to the
City Assessor to come over whenever you can arrange an hour and go
over my schedule with me.By the way, tell Hood to take steps at once
to foreclose on the Bradley estate.Did you find out where Ketchim
does his banking?""Yes, sir," replied the secretary, "the Commercial State.""Very well, get the president, Mr.A few moments later Ames had purchased from the Commercial State bank
its note against the Ketchim Realty Company for ten thousand dollars."I thought Ketchim would be borrowing again," he chuckled, when he had
completed the transaction."His brains are composed of a disastrous
mixture of hypocrisy and greed.I've thrown another hook into him
now."At nine forty-five Ames left his private office and descended in his
elevator to the banking house on the second floor.He entered the
directors' room with a determined carriage, nodding pleasantly to his
associates.Taking his seat as chairman, he promptly called the
meeting to order.Some preliminary business occupied the first few minutes, and then
Ames announced:

"Gentlemen, when the State of New York offered the public sixty
millions of four per cent bonds last week, and I advised you to take
them at a premium of six per cent, you objected.I overruled you, and
the bank bought the bonds.Within forty-eight hours they were resold
at a premium of seven per cent, and the bank cleared six hundred
thousand.Now let me suggest that the
psychology of this transaction is worth your study.A commodity is a
drug on the market at one dollar, until somebody is willing to pay a
dollar and a half for it.Then a lot of people will want it, until
somebody else offers a bid of two.Then the price will soar, and the
number of those who covet the article and scramble for it will
increase proportionably.A murmur of admiration rose from the directors."I think," said one,
"that we had better send Mr.Ames to Washington to confer with the
President in regard to the proposed currency legislation.""That is already arranged," put in Ames."I meet the President next
Thursday for a conference on this matter.""Why, in that case," returned Ames with a knowing smile, "I think we
had better give him a little lesson to take out of office with
him--one that will ruin his second-term hopes--and then close our
bank."From the bank, the Board of Trade, the Stock Exchange, and his
luncheon with Senator Gossitch, Ames returned to his office for the
private interviews which his chief secretary had arranged.Then
followed further consultations with Hood over the daily, weekly, and
monthly reports which Ames required from all the various commercial,
financial, and mining enterprises in which he was interested; further
discussions of plans and schemes; further receipt and transmission of
cable, telegraphic, and telephone messages; and meetings with his
heads of departments, his captains, lieutenants, and minor officers,
to listen to their reports and suggestions, and to deliver his quick,
decisive commands, admonitions, and advice.From eight in the morning
until, as was his wont, Ames closed his desk and entered his private
elevator at five-thirty in the evening, his office flashed with the
superenergy of the man, with his intense activity, his decisive words,
and his stupendous endeavors, materialistic, absorptive, ruthless
endeavors.If one should ask what his day really amounted to, we can
but point to these incessant endeavors and their results in augmenting
his already vast material interests and his colossal fortune, a
fortune which Hood believed ran well over a hundred millions, and
which Ames himself knew multiplied that figure by five or ten.And the
fortune was increasing at a frightful pace, for he gave nothing, but
continually drew to himself, always and ever drawing, accumulating,
amassing, and absorbing, and for himself alone.Snapping his desk shut, he held a brief conversation over the wire
with the Beaubien, then descended to his waiting car and was driven
hastily to his yacht, the _Cossack_, where Monsignor Lafelle awaited
as his guest.It was one of the few pleasures which Ames allowed
himself during the warm months, to drop his multifarious interests and
spend the night aboard the _Cossack_, generally alone, rocking gently
on the restless billows, so typical of his own heaving spirit, as the
beautiful craft steamed noiselessly to and fro along the coast, well
beyond the roar of the huge _arena_ where human beings, formed of
dust, yet fatuously believing themselves made in the image of infinite
Spirit, strive and sweat, curse and slay, in the struggle to prove
their doubtful right to live.CHAPTER 13


The _Cossack_, with its great turbines purring like a sleeping kitten,
and its twin screws turning lazily, almost imperceptibly in the dark
waters, moved through the frosty night like a cloud brooding over the
deep.Yet it was a cloud of tremendous potentiality, enwrapping a
spirit of energy incarnate.From far aloft its burning eye pierced a
channel of light through the murky darkness ahead.In its wake it drew
a swell of sparkling phosphorescence, which it carelessly tossed off
on either side as a Calif might throw handfuls of glittering coins to
his fawning beggars.From somewhere in the structure above, the
crackling, hissing wireless mechanism was thrusting its invisible
hands out into the night and catching the fleeting messages that were
borne on the intangible pulsations of the mysterious ether.From time
to time these messages were given form and body, and despatched to the
luxurious suite below, where, in the dazzling sheen of silver and cut
glass, spread out over richest napery, and glowing beneath a torrent
of white light, sat the gigantic being whose will directed the
movements of this floating palace."You see, Lafelle, I look upon religion with the eye of the
cold-blooded business man, without the slightest trace of sentimentalism.From the business standpoint, the Protestant Church is a dead failure.It doesn't get results that are in any way commensurate with its
investment.But your Church is a success--from the point of dollars and
cents.In fact, in the matter of forming and maintaining a monopoly, I
take off my hat to the Vatican.Every day I learn something of value by studying your methods of
operating upon the public.And so you see why I take such pleasure in
talking with really astute churchmen like yourself."Monsignor Lafelle studied the man without replying, uncertain just
what interpretation to put upon the remark.The Japanese servant was
clearing away the remnants of the meal, having first lighted the
cigars of the master and guest."Now," continued Ames, leaning back in his luxurious chair and musing
over his cigar, "the purgatory idea is one of the cleverest schemes
ever foisted upon the unthinking masses, and it has proved a veritable
Klondike.if I could think up and put over a thing like that I'd
consider myself really possessed of brains."Ames," he replied adroitly, "you
do not know your Bible."I don't suppose I ever in my life read a whole
chapter in the book.I can't swallow such stuff, Lafelle--utterly
unreasonable, wholly inconsistent with facts and natural laws, as we
know and are able to observe them.Even as a child I never had any
use for fairy-tales, or wonder-stories.I always wanted facts,
tangible, concrete, irrefutable facts, not hypotheses.The Protestant
churches hand out a mess of incoherent guesswork, based on as many
interpretations of the Bible as there are human minds sufficiently
interested to interpret it, and then wax hot and angry when
hard-headed business men like myself refuse to subscribe to it.If they had anything tangible to
offer, it would be different.But I go to church for the looks of
the thing, and for business reasons; and then stick pins into myself
to keep awake while I listen to pedagogical Borwell tell what he
doesn't know about God and man.Then at the close of the service I
drop a five-dollar bill into the plate for the entertainment, and
go away with the feeling that I didn't get my money's worth.From a
business point of view, a Protestant church service is worth about
twenty-five cents for the music, and five cents for the privilege of
sleeping on a soft cushion.So you see I lose four dollars and
seventy cents every time I attend.You Catholic fellows, with your
ceremonial and legerdemain, give a much better entertainment.Besides, I like to hear your priests soak it to their cowering
flocks.""I shall have to class you with the incorrigibles," he
said with a rueful air."I am sorry you take such a harsh attitude
toward us.We are really more spiritual--"

Ames interrupted with a roar of laughter."Why, Lafelle, you old fraud, I look upon your
Church as a huge business institution, a gigantic trust, as mercenary
and merciless as Steel, Oil, or Tobacco!Why, you and I are in the
same business, that of making money!And I'd like to borrow some of
your methods.Only, you've got it over me, for you
hurl the weight of centuries of authority upon the poor, trembling
public; and I have to beat them down with clubs of my own making.Moreover, the law protects you in all your pious methods; while I have
to hire expensive legal talent to get around it.""You seem to be fairly successful, even at that," retorted Lafelle.Then, too politic to draw his host into an acrimonious argument that
might end in straining their now cordial and mutually helpful
friendship, he observed, looking at his cigar: "May I ask what you pay
for these?--for only an inexhaustible bank reserve can warrant their
like."He had struck the right chord, and Ames softened at once."These," he
said, tenderly regarding the thick, black weed in his fingers, "are
grown exclusively for me on my own plantation in Colombia.They cost
me about one dollar and sixty-eight cents each, laid down at my door
in New York.I searched the world over before I found the only spot
where such tobacco could be grown."continued Lafelle, lifting his glass of sparkling
champagne."On a little hillside, scarcely an acre in extent, in Granada, Spain,"
replied Ames."I have my own wine press and bottling plant there."Lafelle could not conceal his admiration for this man of luxury."And
does your exclusiveness extend also to your tea and coffee?""I grow tea for my table in both China and
Ceylon.And I have exclusive coffee plantations in Java and Brazil.But I'm now negotiating for one in Colombia, for I think that, without
doubt, the finest coffee in the world is grown there, although it
never gets beyond the coast line.""_Fortuna non deo_," murmured the churchman; "you man of chance and
destiny!""My friend," said he, "I have always insisted
that I possessed but a modicum of brains; but I am a gambler.With ordinary judgment and horse-sense, I take risks that
no so-called sane man would consider.The curse of the world is
fear--the chief instrument that you employ to hold the masses to your
churchly system.I know that as long as a
business opponent has fear to contend with, I am his master.Fear is
at the root of every ailment of mind, body, or environment.I repeat,
I know not the meaning of the word.Hence my position in the business
world.Hence, also, my freedom from the limitations of superstition,
religious or otherwise."Yes," replied Lafelle, drawing a long sigh, "in a sense I do.But you
greatly err, my friend, in deprecating your own powerful intellect.I
know of no brain but yours that could have put South Ohio Oil from one
hundred and fifty dollars up to over two thousand a share.I had a few
shares of that stock myself."Sorry I didn't know about it," he said.I didn't own a dollar's worth of South Ohio.Oh,
yes," he added, as he saw Lafelle's eyes widening in surprise, "I
pushed the market up until a certain lady, whom you and I both know,
thought it unwise to go further, and then I sprung the sudden
discovery of Colombian oil fields on them; and the market crashed
like a burst balloon.The lady cleared some two millions on the rig.No, I didn't have a drop of Colombian oil to grease the chute.It was
American nerve, that's all.""If you had lived in the Middle Ages you'd
have been burnt for possessing a devil!""On the contrary," quickly amended Ames, his eyes twinkling, "I'd have
been made a Cardinal."Both men laughed over the retort; and then Ames summoned the valet to
set in motion the great electrical pipe-organ, and to bring the
whiskey and soda.For the next hour the two men gave themselves up to the supreme luxury
of their magnificent environment, the stimulation of their beverage
and cigars, and the soothing effect of the soft music, combined with
the gentle movement of the boat.Then Ames took his guest into the
smoking room proper, and drew up chairs before a small table, on which
were various papers and writing materials."Now," he began, "referring to your telephone message of this morning,
what is it that you want me to do for you?Is it the old question of
establishing a nunciature at Washington?"Lafelle had been impatiently awaiting this moment.He therefore
plunged eagerly into his subject.Ames," said he, "I know you to
have great influence at the Capital.In the interests of humanity, I
ask you to use that influence to prevent the passage of the
immigration bill which provides for a literacy test."There was no need of this request; for, in the
interests, not of humanity, but of his own steamship companies, he
intended that there should be no restriction imposed upon immigration.But the Church was again playing into his hands, coming to him for
favors.And the Church always paid heavily for his support.he exclaimed with an assumption of interest, "so you ask me to
impugn my own patriotism!""I don't quite understand," he said."Why," Ames explained, "how long do you figure it will take, with
unrestricted immigration, for the Catholics to so outnumber the
Protestants in the United States as to establish their religion by law
and force it into the schools?""But your Constitution provides toleration for all
religions!""And the Constitution is quite flexible, and wholly subject to
amendment, is it not?"Lafelle flared out in unrestrained anger."What a bugaboo you
Protestants make of Roman Catholicism!"Why,
one would think that we Catholics were all anarchists!Are we such a
menace, such a curse to your Republican institutions?Do you ever stop
to realize what the Church has done for civilization, and for your
own country?And where, think you, would art and learning be now but
for her?Have you any adequate idea what the Church is doing
to-day for the poor, for the oppressed?You Protestants,
a thousand times more intolerant than we, treat us as if we were
Hindoo pariahs!This whole country is suffering from the delirium of
Roman Catholic-phobia!"There, my friend, calm yourself," soothed Ames, laying a hand on the
irate churchman's arm."And please do not class me with the
Protestants, for I am not one of them.You Catholic fellows have made
admirable gains in the past few years, and your steady encroachments
have netted you about ninety per cent of all the political offices in
and about Washington, so you have no complaint, even if the Church
isn't in politics.Meantime, his brain was working
rapidly."By the way, Lafelle," he said, abruptly resuming the
conversation, "you know all about church laws and customs, running way
back to mediaeval times.Can't you dig up some old provision whereby I
can block a fellow who claims to own a gold mine down in Colombia?If
you can, I'll see that the President vetoes every obnoxious
immigration bill that's introduced this term."Lafelle roused from his sulk and gulped down his wrath.Ames went on
to express his desire for vengeance upon one obscure Philip O. Ketchim,
broker, promoter, church elder, and Sunday school superintendent.Then at length Ames rose and rang for his valet."My God, Lafelle, the
idea's a corker!""From a book entitled 'Confessions of a Roman
Catholic Priest,' written anonymously, but, they say, by a young
attache of the Vatican who was insane at the time.However, he was apparently well informed on matters Colombian.""The law of _'en manos muertas'_," replied Lafelle."Well," exclaimed Ames, "again I take off my hat to your churchly
system!And now," he continued eagerly, "cable the Pope at once.I'll
have the operator send your code ashore by wireless, and the message
will go to Rome to-night.Tell the old man you've got influence at
work in Washington that is--well, more than strong, and that the
prospects for defeating the immigration bill are excellent."Lafelle arose and stood for a moment looking about the room."Before I
retire, my friend," he said, "I would like to express again the
admiration which the tasteful luxury of this smoking room has aroused
in me, and to ask, if I may, whether those stained-glass windows up
there are merely fanciful portraits?"Ames quickly glanced up at the faces of the beautiful women portrayed
in the rectangular glass windows which lined the room just below the
ceiling.They were exquisitely painted, in vivid colors, and so set as
to be illuminated during the day by sunlight, and at night by strong
electric lamps behind them."Because," returned Lafelle, "if I mistake not, I have seen a portrait
similar to that one," pointing up at one of the windows, where a sad,
wistful face of rare loveliness looked down upon them.In his complete absorption he had not noticed the
effect of his query upon Ames."I do not know," he replied slowly."London--Paris--Berlin--no, not there.And yet, it was in Europe, I am
sure."In the--Royal Gallery--at Madrid!""Yes," continued Lafelle confidently, still studying the portrait, "I
am certain of it.But," turning abruptly upon Ames, "you may have
known the original?""I assure you I never had that
pleasure," he said lightly."These art windows were set in by the
designer of the yacht.Adds much to the
general effect, don't you think?By the way, if a portrait similar to
that one hangs in the Royal Gallery at Madrid, you might try to learn
the identity of the original for me.It's quite interesting to feel
that one may have the picture of some bewitching member of royalty
hanging in his own apartments.By all means try to learn who the lady
is--unless you know."He stopped and searched the churchman's face.But--that picture
has haunted me from the day I first saw it in the Royal Gallery."Crafts, of 'Storrs and Crafts,'" replied Ames.Lafelle moved thoughtfully toward the door.The valet appeared at that
moment."Show Monsignor to his stateroom," commanded Ames."Good night,
Monsignor, good night.Remember, we dock at seven-thirty, sharp."Returning to the table, Ames sat down and rapidly composed a message
for his wireless operator to send across the dark waters to the city,
and thence to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, in Cartagena.This done, he
extinguished all the lights in the room excepting those which
illuminated the stained-glass windows above.Drawing his chair up in
front of the one which had stirred Lafelle's query, he sat before it
far into the morning, in absorbed contemplation, searching the sad
features of the beautiful face, pondering, revolving, sometimes
murmuring aloud, sometimes passing a hand across his brow, as if he
would erase from a relentless memory an impression made long since and
worn ever deeper by the recurrent thought of many years.CHAPTER 14


Almost within the brief period of a year, the barefoot, calico-clad
Carmen had been ejected from unknown Simiti and dropped into the midst
of the pyrotechnical society life of the great New World metropolis.Only an unusual interplay of mental forces could have brought about
such an odd result.But that it was a very logical outcome of the
reaction upon one another of human ambitions, fears, lust, and greed,
operating through the types of mind among which her life had been
cast, those who have followed our story thus far can have no doubt.The cusp of the upward-sweeping curve had been reached through the
insane eagerness of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to outdo her wealthy society
rivals in an arrogant display of dress, living, and vain, luxurious
entertaining, and the acquisition of the empty honor attaching to
social leadership.The coveted prize was now all but within the
shallow woman's grasp.she knew not that when her itching
fingers closed about it the golden bauble would crumble to ashes.The program as outlined by the Beaubien had been faithfully followed.Hawley-Crowles--whom, of course, she
had long desired to know more intimately--and an interchange of calls
had ensued, succeeded by a grand reception at the Ames mansion, the
first of the social season.Hawley-Crowles floated, as
upon a cloud, attired in a French gown which cost fifteen hundred
dollars, and shoes on her disproportioned feet for which she had
rejoiced to pay thirty dollars each, made as they had been from
specially selected imported leather, dyed to match her rich robe.It
was true, her pleasure had not been wholly unalloyed, for she had been
conscious of a trace of superciliousness on the part of some of the
gorgeous birds of paradise, twittering and hopping in their hampering
skirts about the Ames parlors, and pecking, with milk-fed content, at
the rare cakes and ices.But she only held her empty head the higher,
and fluttered about the more ostentatiously and clumsily, while
anticipating the effect which her charming and talented ward would
produce when she should make her bow to these same vain, haughty
devotees of the cult of gold.And she had wisely planned that Carmen's
_debut_ should follow that of Kathleen Ames, that it might eclipse her
rival's in its wanton display of magnificence.On the heels of the Ames reception surged the full flood of the
winter's social orgy.Early in November Kathleen Ames was duly
presented.The occasion was made one of such stupendous display that
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles first gasped, then shivered with apprehension,
lest she be unable to outdo it.She went home from it in a somewhat
chastened frame of mind, and sat down at her _escritoire_ to make
calculations.Could she on her meager annual income of one hundred and
fifty thousand hope to meet the Ames millions?She had already allowed
that her wardrobe would cost not less than twenty-five thousand
dollars a year, to say nothing of the additional expense of properly
dressing Carmen.But she now saw that this amount was hopelessly
inadequate.She therefore increased the figure to seventy-five
thousand.Could she maintain her
city home, entertain in the style now demanded by her social position,
and spend her summers at Newport, as she had planned?No, her income would not suffice; she would be obliged to
draw on the principal until Carmen could be married off to some
millionaire, or until her own father died.if he would only
terminate his useless existence soon!But, in lieu of that delayed desideratum, some expedient must be
devised at once.That obscure, retiring
woman was annually making her millions.A tip now and then from her, a
word of advice regarding the market, and her own limited income would
expand accordingly.She had not seen the Beaubien since becoming a
member of Holy Saints.But on that day, and again, two months later,
when the splendid altar to the late lamented and patriotic citizen,
the Honorable James Hawley-Crowles, was dedicated, she had marked the
woman, heavily veiled, sitting alone in the rear of the great church.She had shuddered as she
thought the tall, black-robed figure typified an ominous shadow
falling athwart her own foolish existence.But there was no doubt of Carmen's hold on the strange, tarnished
woman.And so, smothering her doubts and pocketing her pride, she
again sought the Beaubien, ostensibly in regard to Carmen's
forthcoming _debut_; and then, very adroitly and off-handedly, she
brought up the subject of investments, alleging that the added burden
of the young girl now rendered it necessary to increase the rate of
interest which her securities were yielding.The Beaubien proved herself the soul of candor and generosity.Not
only did she point out to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles how her modest income
might be quadrupled, but she even offered, in such a way as to make it
utterly impossible for that lady to take offense, to lend her whatever
amount she might need, at any time, to further Carmen's social
conquest.And during the conversation she announced that she herself
was acting on a suggestion dropped by the great financier, Ames, and
was buying certain stocks now being offered by a coming power in world
finance, Mr.Hawley-Crowles had heard of this man!Was he not
promoting a company in which her sister's husband, and the girl
herself, were interested?And if such investments were good enough for
a magnate of Ames's standing, they certainly were good enough for her.Indeed, why had she not thought of
this before!She would get Carmen to hypothecate her own interest in
this new company, if necessary.That interest of itself was worth a
fortune.Hawley-Crowles and Carmen so desired, the
Beaubien would advance them whatever they might need on that
security alone.Or, she would take the personal notes of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles--"For, you know, my dear," she said sweetly, "when
your father passes away you are going to be very well off, indeed, and
I can afford to discount that inevitable event somewhat, can I
not?"Hawley-Crowles soared into the empyrean, and this
self-absorbed woman, who never in her life had earned the equivalent
of a single day's food, launched the sweet, white-souled girl of
the tropics upon the oozy waters of New York society with such
_eclat_ that the Sunday newspapers devoted a whole page, profusely
illustrated, to the gorgeous event and dilated with much extravagance
of expression upon the charms of the little Inca princess, and
upon the very important and gratifying fact that the three hundred
fashionable guests present displayed jewels to the value of not less
than ten million dollars.The function took the form of a musicale, in which Carmen's rich
voice was first made known to the _beau monde_.The girl instantly
swept her auditors from their feet.The splendid pipe-organ, which
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles had hurriedly installed for the occasion,
became a thing inspired under her deft touch.It seemed in that
garish display of worldliness to voice her soul's purity, its
wonder, its astonishment, its lament over the vacuities of this
highest type of human society, its ominous threats of thundered
denunciation on the day when her tongue should be loosed and the
present mesmeric spell broken--for she was under a spell, even
that of this new world of tinsel and material veneer.Gannette wept on Carmen's shoulder, and went
home vowing that she would be a better woman and cut out her night-cap
of Scotch-and-soda.Others crowded about the girl and showered their
fulsome praise upon her.Ames and her daughter
Kathleen.They stared at the lovely _debutante_ with wonder and
chagrin written legibly upon their bepowdered visages.And before the
close of the function Kathleen had become so angrily jealous that she
was grossly rude to Carmen when she bade her good night.For her own
feeble light had been drowned in the powerful radiance of the girl
from Simiti.And from that moment the assassination of the character
of the little Inca princess was decreed.But, what with incessant striving to adapt herself to her environment,
that she might search its farthest nook and angle; what with ceaseless
efforts to check her almost momentary impulse to cry out against the
vulgar display of modernity and the vicious inequity of privilege
which she saw on every hand; what with her purity of thought; her rare
ideals and selfless motives; her boundless love for humanity; and her
passionate desire to so live her "message" that all the world might
see and light their lamps at the torch of her burning love for God and
her fellow-men, Carmen found her days a paradox, in that they were
literally full of emptiness.After her _debut_, event followed event
in the social life of the now thoroughly gay metropolis, and the poor
child found herself hustled home from one function, only to change her
attire and hurry again, weary of spirit, into the waiting car, to be
whisked off to another equally vapid.It seemed to the bewildered girl
that she would never learn what was _de rigueur_; what conventions
must be observed at one social event, but amended at another.Her
tight gowns and limb-hampering skirts typified the soul-limitation of
her tinsel, environment; her high-heeled shoes were exquisite torture;
and her corsets, which her French maid drew until the poor girl gasped
for air, seemed to her the cruellest device ever fashioned by the
vacuous, enslaved human mind.Frequently she changed her clothing
completely three and four times a day to meet her social demands.Night became day; and she had to learn to sleep until noon.She found
no time for study; none even for reading.And conversation, such as
was indulged under the Hawley-Crowles roof, was confined to insipid
society happenings, with frequent sprinklings of racy items anent
divorce, scandal, murder, or the debauch of manhood.From this she
drew more and more aloof and became daily quieter.It was seldom, too, that she could escape from the jaded circle of
society revelers long enough to spend a quiet hour with the Beaubien.But when she could, she would open the reservoirs of her soul and give
full vent to her pent-up emotions."Oh," she would often exclaim, as
she sat at the feet of the Beaubien in the quiet of the darkened music
room, and gazed into the crackling fire, "how can they--how can
they!"Then the Beaubien would pat her soft, glowing cheek and murmur, "Wait,
dearie, wait."And the tired girl would sigh and close her eyes and
dream of the quiet of little Simiti and of the dear ones there from
whom she now heard no word, and yet whom she might not seek, because
of the war which raged about her lowly birthplace.The gay season was hardly a month advanced when Mrs.Ames angrily
admitted to herself that her own crown was in gravest danger.The
South American girl--and because of her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her
blase sister--had completely captured New York's conspicuous circle.Hawley-Crowles apparently did not lack for funds, but entertained
with a display of reckless disregard for expense, and a carelessness
of critical comment, that stirred the city to its depths and aroused
expressions of wonder and admiration on every hand.The newspapers
were full of her and her charming ward.Surely, if the girl's social
prestige continued to soar, the Ames family soon would be relegated to
the social "has-beens."Ames and her haughty daughter held
many a serious conference over their dubious prospects.Night after night, when the Beaubien's dinner
guests had dispersed, he would linger to discuss the social war now in
full progress, and to exchange with her witty comments on the
successes of the combatants.One night he announced, "Lafelle is in
England; and when he returns he is coming by way of the West Indies.I
shall cable him to stop for a week at Cartagena, to see Wenceslas on a
little matter of business for me."Hawley-Crowles has become
nicely enmeshed in his net," she returned."The altar to friend Jim is
a beauty.Also, I hear that she is going to finance Ketchim's mining
company in Colombia.""I learned to-day that Ketchim's engineer, Harris,
has returned to the States.Couldn't get up the Magdalena river, on
account of the fighting.There will be nothing doing there for a year
yet.""Just as well," commented the Beaubien.Then abruptly--"By the way, I
now hold Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's notes to the amount of two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars.I want you to buy them from me and be ready to
turn the screws when I tell you."he exclaimed, pinching her
cheek.I'll take them off your hands to-morrow.And by the
way, I must meet this Carmen.""You let her alone," said the Beaubien quickly in a low voice.*       *       *       *       *

The inauguration of the Grand Opera season opened to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
another avenue for her astonishing social activities.With rare
shrewdness she had contrived to outwit Mrs.Ames and secure the center
box in the "golden horseshoe" at the Metropolitan.There, like a gaudy
garden spider in its glittering web, she sat on the opening night,
with her rapt _protegee_ at her side, and sent her insolent challenge
broadcast.Multimillionaires and their haughty, full-toileted dames were
ranged on either side of her, brewers and packers, distillers and
patent medicine concoctors, railroad magnates and Board of Trade
plungers, some under indictment, others under the shadow of death,
all under the mesmeric charm of gold.In the box at her left sat the
Ames family, with their newly arrived guests, the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her son.Ames was smiling
and affable when she exchanged calls with the gorgeous occupants of
the Hawley-Crowles box."So chawmed to meet you," murmured the heir of Altern, a callow youth
of twenty-three, bowing over the dainty, gloved hand of Carmen.Then,
as he adjusted his monocle and fixed his jaded eyes upon the fresh
young girl, "Bah Jove!"The gigantic form of Ames wedged in between the young man and Carmen."I've heard a lot about you," he said genially, in a heavy voice that
harmonized well with his huge frame; "but we haven't had an
opportunity to get acquainted until to-night."For some moments he stood holding her hand and looking steadily at
her.The girl gazed up at him with her trustful brown eyes alight, and
a smile playing about her mouth.While she chatted brightly Ames held her hand and laughed at her
frank, often witty, remarks.But then a curious, eager look came into
his face, and he became quiet and reflective.He seemed unable to take
his eyes from her.And when the girl gently drew her hand from his he
laughed again, nervously."I--I know something about Colombia," he said, "and speak the language
a bit.We'll have to get together often, so's I can brush up."Hawley-Crowles and her sister for the
first time--"Oh, so glad to see you both!Camorso's in fine voice
to-night, eh?"He wheeled about and stood again looking at Carmen, until she blushed
under his close gaze and turned her head away.But throughout the evening, whenever the girl looked in the
direction of the Ames family, she met the steady, piercing gaze of the
man's keen gray eyes.And they seemed to her like sharp steel points,
cutting into the portals of her soul.Night after night during the long season Carmen sat in the box and
studied the operas that were produced on the boards before her
wondering gaze.Hawley-Crowles was with her.And
generally, too, the young heir of Altern was there, occupying the
chair next to the girl--which was quite as the solicitous Mrs."Aw--deucedly fine show to-night, Miss Carmen," the youth ventured one
evening, as he took his accustomed place close to her."The music is always beautiful," the girl responded."But the play,
like most of Grand Opera, is drawn from the darkest side of human
life.It is a sordid picture of licentiousness and cruelty.Only for
its setting in wonderful music, Grand Opera is generally such a
depiction of sex-passion, of lust and murder, that it would not be
permitted on the stage.A few years from now people will be horrified
to remember that the preceding generation reveled in such blood
scenes--just as we now speak with horror of the gladiatorial contests
in ancient Rome.""But--aw--Miss Carmen," he
hazarded, "we must be true to life, you know!"Having delivered
himself of this oracular statement, the youth adjusted his monocle and
settled back as if he had given finality to a weighty argument."You voice the cant of the modern
writer, 'true lo life.'True to the horrible, human sense of life,
that looks no higher than the lust of blood, and is satisfied with it,
I admit.True to the unreal, temporal sense of existence, that is here
to-day, and to-morrow has gone out in the agony of self-imposed
suffering and death.True to that awful, false sense of life which we
must put off if we would ever rise into the consciousness of _real_
life, I grant you.But the production of these horrors on the stage,
even in a framework of marvelous music, serves only to hold before us
the awful models from which we must turn if we would hew out a better
existence.Are you the better for seeing an exhibition of wanton
murder on the stage, even though the participants wondrously sing
their words of vengeance and passion?""But--aw--they serve as warnings; they show us the things we ought not
to do, don't you know.""The sculptor who would chisel a beautiful form, does he
set before him the misshapen body of a hunchback, in order that he may
see what not to carve?""And we who would transform the
human sense of life into one of freedom from evil, can we build a
perfect structure with such grewsome models as this before us?You
don't see it now," she sighed; "you are in the world, and of it; and
the world is deeply under the mesmeric belief of evil as a stern
reality.But the day is coming when our musicians and authors will
turn from such base material as this to nobler themes--themes which
will excite our wonder and admiration, and stimulate the desire for
purity of thought and deed--themes that will be beacon lights, and
true guides.Hawley-Crowles frowned heavily as she listened to this
conversation, and she drew a sigh of relief when Carmen, sensing the
futility of any attempt to impress her thought upon the young man,
turned to topics which he could discuss with some degree of
intelligence.Late in the evening Ames dropped in and came directly to the
Hawley-Crowles box.He brought a huge box of imported candy and a
gorgeous bouquet of orchids, which he presented to Carmen.Hawley-Crowles beamed upon him like the effulgent midday sun."Kathleen wants you, Reggy," Ames abruptly announced to the young man,
whose lips were molding into a pout.His huge bulk loomed over the younger man like a
mountain as he took him by the shoulders and turned him toward the
exit.protested the youth, with a vain show
of resistance.Ames said nothing; but his domineering personality forced the boy out
of the box and into the corridor.Then he took the seat which his evicted nephew
had vacated, and bent over Carmen.With a final hopeless survey of the
situation, Reginald turned and descended to the cloak room, muttering
dire but futile threats against his irresistible relative.Ames's manner unconsciously assumed an air of
patronage."This is the first real opportunity I've had to talk with
you.Tell me, what do you think of New York?""Well," she began uncertainly, "since I have
thawed out, or perhaps have become more accustomed to the cold, I have
begun to make mental notes.But they
are not yet classified, and so I can hardly answer your question, Mr.But I am sure of one thing, and that is that for the first few
months I was here I was too cold to even think!""Yes," he agreed, "the change from the tropics was
somewhat abrupt."It is like awaking from a deep sleep," answered Carmen meditatively."In Simiti we dream our lives away.In New York all is action; loud
words; harsh commands; hurry; rush; endeavor, terrible, materialistic
endeavor!Every person I see seems to be going somewhere.He may not
know where he is going--but he is on the way.He may not know why he
is going--but he must not be stopped.He has so few years to live; and
he must pile up money before he goes.He must own an automobile; he
must do certain things which his more fortunate neighbor does, before
his little flame of life goes out and darkness falls upon him.I
sometimes think that people here are trying to get away from
themselves, but they don't know it.I think they come to the opera
because they crave any sort of diversion that will make them forget
themselves for a few moments, don't you?"well, I can't say," was Ames's meaningless reply, as he sat
regarding the girl curiously."And," she continued, as if pleased to have an auditor who at least
pretended to understand her, "the thing that now strikes me most
forcibly is the great confusion that prevails here in everything, in
your government, in your laws, in your business, in your society, and,
in particular, in your religion.Why, in that you have hundreds of
sects claiming a monopoly of truth; you have hundreds of churches,
hundreds of religious or theological beliefs, hundreds of differing
concepts of God--but you get nowhere!Why, it has come to such a pass
that, if Jesus were to appear physically on earth to-day, I am sure he
would be evicted from his own Church!""Well, yes, I guess that's so," commented Ames, quite at sea in such
conversation."But we solid business men have found that religious
emotion never gets a man anywhere.Makes a man
effeminate, and utterly unfits him for business.I wouldn't have a man
in my employ who was a religious enthusiast.""But Jesus was a religious enthusiast," she protested."I doubt if there ever was such a person," he answered dryly."Why, the Bible--"

"Is the most unfortunate and most misunderstood piece of literature
ever written," he interrupted."And the Church, well, I regard it as
the greatest fraud ever perpetrated upon the human race.""You mean that to apply to every church?"But their thoughts were running in widely divergent
channels.The conversational topic of the moment had no interest
whatsoever for the man.But this brilliant, sparkling girl--there was
something in those dark eyes, that soft voice, that brown hair--by
what anomaly did this beautiful creature come out of desolate,
mediaeval Simiti?Ames, you do not know what religion is.""It is that which binds us to God."No, he knew not the meaning of the word.His thought
broke restraint and flew wildly back--but he caught it, and rudely
forced it into its wonted channel.But, did he love his fellow-men?What would that profit him in dollars and cents?The thought brought a cynical laugh to
his lips.Carmen looked up at him wonderingly."You will have to, you
know," she said quixotically.Then she reached out a hand and laid it on his.He looked down at it,
so soft, so white, so small, and he contrasted it with the huge, hairy
bulk of his own.He felt it, felt
himself yielding.He was beginning to look beyond the beautiful
features, the rare grace and charm of physical personality, which had
at first attracted only the baser qualities of his nature, and was
seeing glimpses of a spiritual something which lay back of all
that--infinitely more beautiful, unspeakably richer, divine, sacred,
untouchable."Of course you will attend the Charity Ball, Mr.Hawley-Crowles jarred upon his ear like a shrill discord."But I shall be represented by my family.Hawley-Crowles, taking the query to
herself."That is, if my French dressmaker does not fail me.She
arched her brows at him as she propounded this innocent question."I'll tell you what it is this year," he sagely
replied.He gave a sententious nod of
his head."I overheard Kathleen and her mother discussing plans.And--do you want to know next season's innovation?He stopped and laughed heartily at his own treasonable
deceit.Hawley-Crowles eagerly, as she drew her
chair closer."One condition," replied Ames, holding up a thick finger."Well, I want to get better acquainted with your charming ward," he
whispered."Of course; and I want you to know her better." wigs," said Ames, with a knowing look.Hawley-Crowles settled back with a smile of supreme satisfaction.She would boldly anticipate next season at the coming Charity Ball.Then, leaning over toward Ames, she laid her fan upon his arm."Can't
you manage to come and see us some time, my sister and Carmen?"Just call me up a little in advance."The blare of trumpets and the crash of drums drew their attention
again to the stage.A business
associate in a distant box had beckoned him.Hawley-Crowles
dismissed him reluctantly; then turned her wandering attention to the
play.But Carmen sat shrouded in thoughts that were not stimulated by the
puppet-show before her.The tenor shrieked out his tender passion, and
the tubby soprano sank into his inadequate arms with languishing
sighs.Carmen heeded not their stage amours.She saw in the glare
before her the care-lined face of the priest of Simiti; she saw the
grim features and set jaw of her beloved, black-faced Rosendo, as he
led her through the dripping jungle; she saw Anita's blind, helpless
babe; she saw the little newsboy of Cartagena; and her heart welled
with a great love for them all; and she buried her face in her hands
and wept softly.CHAPTER 15

"Wait, my little princess, wait," the Beaubien had said, when Carmen,
her eyes flowing and her lips quivering, had again thrown herself into
that strange woman's arms and poured out her heart's surcease."I want to go back to Simiti, to Padre Jose, to my home," wailed the
girl."I don't understand the ways and the thoughts of these people.They don't know God--they don't know what love is--they don't know
anything but money, and clothes, and sin, and death.When I am with
them I gasp, I choke--"

"Yes, dearest, I understand," murmured the woman softly, as she
stroked the brown head nestling upon her shoulder.And many even of the 'four hundred' are suffering from the
same disease; but they would die rather than admit it.To no one could the attraction which had drawn Carmen and the Beaubien
together seem stranger, more inexplicable, than to that lone woman
herself.And both acknowledged it, nor
would have had it otherwise.To Carmen, the Beaubien was a sympathetic
confidante and a wise counselor.The girl knew nothing of the woman's
past or present life.She tried to see in her only the reality which
she sought in every individual--the reality which she felt that Jesus
must have seen clearly back of every frail mortal concept of humanity.And in doing this, who knows?--she may have transformed the sordid,
soiled woman of the world into something more than a broken semblance
of the image of God.To the Beaubien, this rare child, the symbol of
love, of purity, had become a divine talisman, touching a dead soul
into a sense of life before unknown.If Carmen leaned upon her, she,
on the other hand, bent daily closer to the beautiful girl; opened her
slowly warming heart daily wider to her; twined her lonely arms daily
closer about the radiant creature who had come so unexpectedly into
her empty, sinful life."But, mother dear"--the Beaubien had long since begged Carmen always
to address her thus when they were sharing alone these hours of
confidence--"they will not listen to my message!They laugh and jest
about real things!"And yet you tell me that the Bible says wise men
laughed at the great teacher, Jesus."And his message--oh, mother dearest, his message would have
helped them so, if they had only accepted it!It would have changed
their lives, healed their diseases, and saved them from death.And my
message"--her lip quivered--"my message is only his--it is the message
of love.But--I am so out of place among them.Their talk is so coarse, so
low and degraded.They don't
know what miserable failures they all are.Hawley-Crowles--"

The Beaubien's jaw set.--she will not let me speak of God in her house.She told me to keep
my views to myself and never voice them to her friends.And she says I
must marry either a millionaire or a foreign noble."And become a snobbish expatriate!Marry a decadent count, and
then shake the dust of this democratic country from your feet forever!Go to London or Paris or Vienna, and wear tiaras and coronets, and
speak of disgraceful, boorish America in hushed whispers!She forgets that the tarnished name she bears was
dragged up out of the ruck of the impecunious by me when I received
Jim Crowles into my house!And that I gave him what little gloss he
was able to take on!""Mother dear--I would leave them--only, they need love, oh, so much!"The Beaubien strained her to her bosom."They need you, dearie; they
little realize how they need you!I, myself, did not know until you
came to me.There, I didn't mean to let those tears get away from
me."She laughed softly as Carmen looked up anxiously into her face."Now come," she went on brightly, "we must plan for the Charity
Ball."A look of pain swept over the girl's face.The Beaubien bent and
kissed her."You will not leave society
voluntarily.They
will light their own lamps at yours--or they will thrust you from
their doors.And then," she muttered, as her teeth snapped together,
"you will come to me."Close on the heels of the opera season followed the Charity Ball, the
Horse Show, and the Fashion Show in rapid succession, with numberless
receptions, formal parties, and nondescript social junketings
interspersed.During these fleeting hours of splash and glitter Mrs.Hawley-Crowles trod the air with the sang-froid and exhilaration of an
expert aviator.Backed by the Beaubien millions, and with the
wonderful South American girl always at her right hand, the
worldly ambitious woman swept everything before her, cut a social
swath far wider than the glowering Mrs.Ames had ever attempted, and
marched straight to the goal of social leadership, almost without
interference.She had apparently achieved other successes, too, of
the first importance.She had secured the assistance of Ames himself
in matters pertaining to her finances; and the Beaubien was
actively cooeperating with her in the social advancement of Carmen.It is true, she gasped whenever her thought wandered to her notes
which the Beaubien held, notes which demanded every penny of her
principal as collateral.And she often meditated very soberly over
the large sums which she had put into the purchase of Simiti stock,
at the whispered suggestions of Ames, and under the irresistibly
pious and persuasive eloquence of Philip O. Ketchim, now president
of that flourishing but as yet non-productive company.But then, one
day, an idea occurred to her, and she forthwith summoned Carmen into
the library."You see, my dear," she said, after expounding to the girl certain of
her thoughts anent the famous mine, "I do not want Mr.Ketchim to have
any claim upon you for the expense which he incurred on account of
your six months in the Elwin school.That thought, as well as others
relating to your complete protection, makes it seem advisable that you
transfer to me your share in the mine, or in the Simiti company.See,
I give you a receipt for the same, showing that you have done this as
part payment for the great expense to which I have been put in
introducing you to society and in providing for your wants here.It is
merely formal, of course.And it keeps your share still in our
family, of which you are and always will be a member; but yet removes
all liability from you.Of course, you know nothing about business
matters, and so you must trust me implicitly.Which I am sure you do,
in view of what I have done for you, don't you, dear?"Of course Carmen did; and of course she unhesitatingly transferred her
claim on La Libertad to the worthy Mrs.Whereupon the
good woman tenderly kissed the innocent child, and clasped a string of
rich pearls about the slender, white neck.And Carmen later told the
Beaubien, who said nothing, but frowned darkly as she repeated the
tidings over her private wire to J. Wilton Ames.But that priest of
finance only chuckled and exclaimed: "Excellent, my dear!By the way, I had a cable from Lafelle this morning, from
Cartagena.But the
Beaubien hung up the receiver with a presentiment that everything was
far from right, despite his bland assurance.And she regretted
bitterly now that she had not warned Carmen against this very thing.The Charity Ball that season was doubtless the most brilliant function
of its kind ever held among a people who deny the impossible.The
newspapers had long vied with one another in their advertisements and
predictions; they afterward strove mightily to outdo themselves in
their vivid descriptions of the gorgeous _fete_.The decorative
effects far excelled anything ever attempted in the name of
"practical" charity.The display of gowns had never before been even
closely approximated.The scintillations from jewels whose value
mounted into millions was like the continuous flash of the electric
spark.And the huge assemblage embraced the very cream of the
nobility, the aristocracy, the rich and exclusive caste of a great
people whose Constitution is founded on the equality of men, and who
are wont to gather thus annually for a few hours to parade their
material vestments and divert their dispirited mentalities under the
guise of benefaction to a class for whom they rarely hold a loving
thought.Hawley-Crowles had planned and executed a _coup_.Ames had subscribed the munificent sum of twenty-five thousand
dollars to charity a week before the ball.Hawley-Crowles had
waited for this.Then she gloated as she telephoned to the various
newspaper offices that her subscription would be fifty thousand.Did
she give a new note to the Beaubien for this amount?That she
did--and she obtained the money on the condition that the little Inca
princess should lead the grand march.Hawley-Crowles
knew that she must gracefully yield first place to the South American
girl; and yet she contrived to score a triumph in apparent defeat.Ames and her daughter Kathleen at the
last moment refused to attend the function, alleging fatigue from a
season unusually exacting.Hawley-Crowles had
previously secured the languid young Duke of Altern as a partner for
Carmen--and then was most agreeably thwarted by Ames himself, who,
learning that his wife and daughter would not attend, abruptly
announced that he himself would lead the march with Carmen.Was it not quite proper that the city's leading man of
finance should, in the absence of his wife and daughter, and with
their full and gratuitous permission--nay, at their urgent request, so
it was told--lead with this fair young damsel, this tropical flower,
who, as rumor had it, was doubtless a descendant of the royal dwellers
in ancient Cuzco?"Quite proper, _O tempora, O mores_!"murmured one Amos A. Hitt,
erstwhile Presbyterian divine, explorer, and gentleman of leisure, as
he settled back in his armchair in the fashionable Weltmore apartments
and exhaled a long stream of tobacco smoke through his wide nostrils."And, if I can procure a ticket, I shall give myself the pleasure of
witnessing this sacred spectacle, produced under the deceptive mask of
charity," he added.In vain the Beaubien labored with Ames when she learned of his
intention--though she said nothing to Carmen.Ames had yielded to her
previously expressed wish that he refrain from calling at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion, or attempting to force his attentions upon the
young girl.But in this matter he remained characteristically
obdurate.For the angry
Beaubien, striving to shield the innocent girl, had vented her
abundant wrath upon the affable Ames, and had concluded her
denunciation with a hint of possible exposure of certain dark facts of
which she was sole custodian.Ames smiled, bowed, and courteously
kissed her hand, as he left her stormy presence; but he did not yield.Through the perfumed air and the garish light tore the crashing notes
of the great band.The loud hum of voices ceased, and all eyes turned
to the leaders of the grand march, as they stepped forth at one end of
the great auditorium.Then an involuntary murmur arose from the
multitude--a murmur of admiration, of astonishment, of envy.The
gigantic form of Ames stood like a towering pillar, the embodiment of
potential force, the epitome of human power, physical and mental.His
massive shoulders were thrown back as if in haughty defiance of
comment, critical or commendatory.The smile which flitted about his
strong, clean-shaven face bespoke the same caution as the gentle
uplifting of a tiger's paw--behind it lay all that was humanly
terrible, cunning, heartless, and yet, in a sense, fascinating.His
thick, brown hair, scarcely touched with gray, lay about his great
head like a lion's mane.He raised a hand and gently pushed it back
over the lofty brow.Then he bent and offered an arm to the slender
wisp of a girl at his side.murmured a tall, angular man in the crowd."I don't know, Hitt," replied the friend addressed."But they say she
belongs to the Inca race."The graceful girl moving by the side of her giant escort seemed like a
slender ray of light, a radiant, elfish form, transparent, intangible,
gliding softly along with a huge, black shadow.She was simply clad,
all in white.About her neck hung a string of pearls, and at her waist
she wore the rare orchids which Ames had sent her that afternoon.No one marked the pure simplicity of her attire.The absence of sparkling jewels and resplendent raiment evoked no
comment.The multitude saw but her wonderful face; her big eyes,
uplifted in trustful innocence to the massive form at her side; her
rich brown hair, which glittered like string-gold in the strong light
that fell in torrents upon it.There's a nimbus about her head!""I could almost believe it," whispered that gentleman, straining his
long neck as she passed before him.Immediately behind Carmen and Ames strode the enraptured Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who saw not, neither heard, and who longed for no
further taste of heaven than this stupendous triumph which she had won
for herself and the girl.Her heavy, unshapely form was squeezed into
a marvelous costume of gold brocade.A double ballet ruffle of stiff
white tulle encircled it about the hips as a drapery.The bodice was
of heavy gold net.A pleated band of pale moire, in a delicate shade
of pink, crossed the left shoulder and was caught at the waist in a
large rose bow, ambassadorial style.A double necklace of diamonds,
one bearing a great pendant of emeralds, and the other an alternation
of emeralds and diamonds, encircled her short, thick neck.A diamond
coronet fitted well around her wonderful amber- wig--for, true
to her determination, she had anticipated the now _passee_ Mrs.Ames
and had boldly launched the innovation of  wigs among the smart
set.An ivory, hand-painted fan, of great value, dangled from her
thick wrist.And, as she lifted her skirts to an unnecessary height,
the gaping people caught the glitter of a row of diamonds in each
high, gilded heel.At her side the young Duke of Altern shuffled, his long, thin body
curved like a kangaroo, and his monocle bent superciliously upon the
mass of common clay about him."Aw, beastly crush, ye know," he
murmured from time to time to the unhearing dame at his right.And
then, as she replied not, he fell to wondering if she fully realized
who he was.Around and across the great hall the gorgeous pageant swept.The
big-mouthed horns bellowed forth their noisy harmony.In the distant
corridors great illuminated fountains softly plashed.At the tables
beyond, sedulous, touting waiters were hurriedly extracting corks from
frosted bottle necks.The rare porcelain and cut glass shone and
glittered in rainbow tints.The revelers waxed increasingly merry and
care-free as they lightly discussed poverty over rich viands and
sparkling Burgundy.Still further beyond, the massive oak doors, with
their leaded-glass panes, shut out the dark night and the bitter
blasts of winter.And they shut out, too, another, but none the less
unreal, externalization of the mortal thought which has found
expression in a social system "too wicked for a smile.""God, no--I'd get arrested!The frail, hungry woman who stood before the great doors clutched her
wretched shawl closer about her thin shoulders.Her teeth chattered as
she stood shivering in the chill wind.At the corner of the building the cold blast almost swept her off her
feet.A man, dirty and unkempt, who had been waiting in an alley, ran
out and seized her."I say, Jude, ain't ye goin' in?Git arrested--ye'd spend the night in
a warm cell, an' that's better'n our bunk, ain't it?""I'm goin' to French Lucy's," the woman whispered hoarsely.Ye've lost yer looks, Jude, an' ol' Lucy ain't a-goin' to take
ye in.We gotta snipe somepin quick--or starve!Look, we'll go down to
Mike's place, an' then come back here when it's out, and ye kin pinch
a string, or somepin, eh?For a moment she stood listening
to the music from within.A sob shook her, and she began to cough
violently.The man took her arm, not unkindly; and together they moved
away into the night.*       *       *       *       *

"Well, little girl, at last we are alone.He had, late in the evening,
secured seats well hidden behind a mass of palms, and thither had led
Carmen.Ever see
anything like this in Simiti?"She was
glad to get away for a moment from the crowd, from the confusion, and
from the unwelcome attentions of the now thoroughly smitten young Duke
of Altern."No," she finally made answer, "I didn't know there were such things
in the world."A new toy--one that would last a long time."Yes," he went on genially, "I'll wager there's millions of dollars'
worth of jewelry here to-night.""And are the people going to sell it and give the
money to the poor?""But--this is a--a charity--"

"Oh, I see.No, it's the money derived from the sale of
tickets that goes to the poor.""But--aren't you interested in the poor?""Of course, of course," he hastened to assure her, in his easy casual
tone.For a long time the girl sat reflecting, while he studied her,
speculating eagerly on her next remark.Then it came abruptly:

"Mr.Ames, I have thought a great deal about it, and I think you
people by your charity, such as this, only make more charity
necessary.Why don't you do away with poverty altogether?"Well, that's quite impossible, you know.'The poor
ye have always with you', eh?She was
deeply serious, for charity to her meant love, and love was all in
all."No," she finally replied, shaking her head, "you do _not_ know your
Bible.It is the poor thought that you have always with you, the
thought of separation from good.And that thought becomes manifested
outwardly in what is called poverty."He regarded her quizzically, while a smile played about his mouth."Why don't you get at the very root of the trouble, and destroy the
poverty-thought, the thought that there can be any separation from
God, who is infinite good?""Well, my dear girl, as for me, I don't know anything about God.As
for you, well, you are very innocent in worldly matters.Poverty, like
death, is inevitable, you know.""Well, well," he returned brightly, "that's good news!Then there is
no such thing as 'the survival of the fittest,' and the weak needn't
necessarily sink, eh?"Ames, that
you have survived as one of the fittest?"Well, now--what would you say about that?""I should say decidedly no," was the blunt reply.A dark shade crossed his face, and he bit his lip.People did not
generally talk thus to him.And yet--this wisp of a girl!how beautiful, as she sat there
beside him, her head erect, and her face delicately flushed.He
reached over and took her hand."You are the kind," she went on, "who give money to the poor, and then
take it away from them again.All the money which these rich people
here to-night are giving to charity has been wrested from the poor.And you give only a part of it back to them, at that.This Ball is
just a show, a show of dress and jewels.Why, it only sets an example
which makes others unhappy, envious, and discontented."My dear little girl," he said in a patronizing tone, "don't you think
you are assuming a great deal?I'm sure I'm not half so bad as you
paint me.""Well, the money you give away has got to come from
some source, hasn't it?And you manipulate the stock market and put
through wheat corners and all that, and catch the poor people and take
their money from them!But your idea of charity makes
me pity you.Up here I find a man can pile up hundreds of millions by
stifling competition, by debauching legislatures, by piracy and
legalized theft, and then give a tenth of it to found a university,
and so atone for his crimes.Oh, I know a lot
about such things!I've been studying and thinking a great deal since
I came to the United States."And there was a touch of
aspersion in his voice."I've come with a message," she replied eagerly."Well," he said sharply, "let me warn and advise you: don't join the
ranks of the muck-rakers, as most ambitious reformers with messages
do.I can tear down as easily as you or
anybody else.But to build something better is entirely another
matter.""Well, what is it, if I may
ask?"Well, perhaps that's so," he said, bending toward her and
again attempting to take her hand."I guess," she said, drawing back quickly, "you don't know what love
is, do you?""Of course I will," she said brightly.And you'll have to do just as I tell you," holding up an admonitory
finger."I'm yours to command, little woman," he returned in mock seriousness."Well," she began very softly, "you must first learn that love is just
as much a principle as the Binomial Theorem in algebra.And you must apply it just as you would apply any
principle, to everything."You sweet little thing," he murmured absently, gazing down into her
glowing face.I
wonder--I wonder if you really are a daughter of the Incas.""Yes," she said, "I am a
princess."You look like--I wonder--pshaw!"And--do you know?--I wish I might
be your prince."But then her bright
smile faded, and she looked off wistfully down the long corridor."I'll send him a challenge
to-night!""No," she murmured gently, "you can't.And,
oh, he was so good to me!He made me leave that country on account of
the war."This innocent girl little knew that one of
the instigators of that bloody revolution sat there beside her.Then a
new thought flashed into his brain."What is the full name of this
priest?""Jose--Jose de Rincon," she whispered reverently.Jose de Rincon--of Simiti--whom Wenceslas had made the scapegoat of
the revolution!And who, according to a
recent report from Wenceslas, had been arrested and--

"A--a--where did you say this--this Jose was, little girl?"You know, he never was a priest at heart.But, though he saw the
truth, in part, he was not able to prove it enough to set himself
free; and so when I came away he stayed behind to work out his
problem.And he will work it all out," she mused abstractedly, looking
off into the distance; "he will work it all out and come--to me.I
am--I am working with him, now--and for him.And--" her voice dropped
to a whisper, "I love him, oh, so much!"His mouth opened; then shut again with a
sharp snap.That beautiful creature now belonged to him, and to none
other!Were there other claimants, he would crush them without mercy!As for this apostate priest, Jose--humph!if he still lived he should
rot the rest of his days in the reeking dungeons of San Fernando!"When he comes to me," she said softly, "we are
going to give ourselves to the whole world.""And--perhaps--perhaps, by that time, you will be--be--"

"Well?"snapped the man, irritated by the return of her thought to
himself.Perhaps by that time you will--you will love everybody," she
murmured."Perhaps you won't go on piling up big mountains of money
that you can't use, and that you won't let anybody else use.""You will know then that Jesus founded his great empire on love.Your
empire, you know, is human business.But you will find that such
empires crumble and fall."Say," he exclaimed, turning full upon her and seeming to bear her
down by his tremendous personality, "you young and inexperienced
reformers might learn a few things, too, if your prejudices could be
surmounted.Has it ever occurred to you that we men of business think
not so much about accumulating money as about achieving success?Do
you suppose you could understand that money-making is but a side issue
with us?""Yes," the girl went on, as if in quiet soliloquy, "I suppose you
are--a tremendous worldly success.And this Ball--it is a splendid
success, too.Thousands of dollars will be raised for the poor.And
then, next year, the same thing will have to be done again.Your
charities cost you hundreds of millions every year up here.And,
meantime, you rich men will go right on making more money at the
expense of your fellow-men--and you will give a little of it to the
poor when the next Charity Ball comes around.It's like a circle,
isn't it?"she said, smiling queerly up at him."It has no end, you
know."Ames had now decided to swallow his annoyance and meet the girl with
the lance of frivolity."Yes, I guess that's so," he began."But of
course you will admit that the world is slowly getting better, and
that world-progress must of necessity be gradual.We can't reform all
in a minute, can we?""I don't know how fast you might reform if you
really, sincerely tried.And if
you, a great, big, powerful man, with the most wonderful opportunities
in the world, should really try to be a success, why--well, I'm sure
you'd make very rapid progress, and help others like you by setting
such a great example.For you are a wonderful man--you really are."Ames looked at her long and quizzically.Then
he took her hand, this time without resistance."Tell me, little girl--although I know there can be no doubt of
it--are you a success?"he ejaculated, "would
you mind telling me just why?"She smiled up at him, and her sweet trustfulness drew his sagging
heartstrings suddenly taut."Because," she said simply, "I strive every moment to 'acquire that
mind which was in Christ Jesus.'"From amusement to wonder, to irritation, to
anger, then to astonishment, and a final approximation to something
akin to reverent awe had been the swift course of the man's emotions
as he sat in this secluded nook beside this strange girl.The
poisoned arrows of his worldly thought had broken one by one against
the shield of her protecting faith.His badinage had returned to
confound himself.The desire to possess had utterly fled before the
conviction that such thought was as wildly impossible as iniquitous.Then he suddenly became conscious that the little body beside him had
drawn closer--that it was pressing against him--that a little hand had
stolen gently into his--and that a soft voice, soft as the summer
winds that sigh among the roses, was floating to his ears."To be really great is to be like that wonderful man, Jesus.It is to
know that through him the great Christ-principle worked and did those
things which the world will not accept, because it thinks them
miracles.It is to know that God is love, and to act that knowledge.It is to know that love is the Christ-principle, and that it will
destroy every error, every discord, everything that is unlike itself.It is to yield your present false sense of happiness and good to the
true sense of God as infinite good.It is to bring every thought into
captivity to this Christ-principle, love.It is to stop looking at
evil as a reality.It is to let go your hold on it, and let it fade
away before the wonderful truth that God is everywhere, and that there
isn't anything apart from Him.*       *       *       *       *

How long they sat in the quiet that followed, neither knew.Then the
man suffered himself to be led silently back to the ball room again.And when he had recovered and restored his worldly self, the bright
little image was no longer at his side."Stand here, Jude, an' when they begins to come out to their gasoline
carts grab anything ye can, an' git.The shivering woman crept closer to the curb, and the man slouched
back against the wall close to the exit from which the revelers would
soon emerge.A distant clock over a jeweler's window chimed the hour
of four.A moment later the door opened, and a lackey came out and
loudly called the number of the Hawley-Crowles car.That ecstatically
happy woman, with Carmen and the obsequious young Duke of Altern,
appeared behind him in the flood of light.As the big car drew softly up, the wretched creature whom the man had
called Jude darted from behind it and plunged full at Carmen.But the
girl had seen her coming, and she met her with outstretched arm.The
glare from the open door fell full upon them.With a quick movement the girl
tore the string of pearls from her neck and thrust it into Jude's
hand.The latter turned swiftly and darted into the blackness of the
street.Then Carmen hurriedly entered the car, followed by her
stupefied companions.It had all been done in a moment of time.Hawley-Crowles, when she had recovered her
composure sufficiently to speak.And the Duke of Altern rubbed his weak eyes
and tried hard to think.Hawley-Crowles sought her bed that morning the east was
red with the winter sun."The loss of the pearls is bad enough," she
exclaimed in conclusion, glowering over the young girl who sat before
her, "for I paid a good three thousand for the string!But, in
addition, to scandalize me before the world--oh, how could you?And
this unspeakable Jude--and that awful house--heavens, girl!Who would
believe your story if it should get out?"The worried woman's face was
bathed in cold perspiration."But--she saved me from--from that place," protested the harassed
Carmen."She was poor and cold--I could see that.Why should I have
things that I don't need when others are starving?"Hawley-Crowles shook her weary head in despair.Reed, who had sat fixing the girl with her cold eyes throughout the
stormy interview following their return from the ball, now offered a
suggestion."The thing to do is to telephone immediately to all the
newspapers, and say that her beads were stolen last night.""But they weren't stolen," asserted the girl."I gave them to her--"

"Go to your room!"Hawley-Crowles, at the limit of her
endurance."And never, under any circumstances, speak of this affair
to any one--never!"The social crown, which had rested none too securely upon the gilded
wig of the dynamic Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, had been given a jolt that set
it tottering.*       *       *       *       *

It was very clear to Mrs.J. Wilton Ames after the Charity Ball that
she was engaged in a warfare to the death, and with the most
relentless of enemies.Nothing short of the miraculous could now
dethrone the detested Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her beautiful,
mysterious ward.She dolefully acknowledged to herself and to the
sulking Kathleen that she had been asleep, that she had let her foot
slip, and that her own husband's conduct in leading the grand march
with Carmen bade fair to give the _coup de grace_ to a social prestige
which for many weeks had been decidedly on the wane."Mamma, we'll have to think up some new stunts," said the dejected
Kathleen over the teacups the noon following the ball."Why, they've
even broken into the front page of the newspapers with a fake jewelry
theft!Look, they pretend that the little minx was robbed of her
string of pearls last night on leaving the hall.Ames's lip curled in disdain as she read the news item."An Inca
princess, indeed!Why doesn't
somebody take the trouble to investigate her?They'd probably find her
an outcast.""Couldn't papa look her up?"She had no wish to discuss her husband, after
the affair of the previous evening.And, even in disregard of that,
she would not have gone to him with the matter.For she and her
consort, though living under the same roof, nevertheless saw each
other but seldom.At times they met in the household elevator; and for
the sake of appearances they managed to dine together with Kathleen in
a strained, unnatural way two or three times a week, at which times no
mention was ever made of the son who had been driven from the parental
roof.There were no exchanges of confidences or affection, and Mrs.Ames knew but little of the working of his mentality.She was wholly
under the dominance of her masterful husband, merely an accessory to
his mode of existence.He used her, as he did countless others, to
buttress a certain side of his very complex life.As for assistance in
determining Carmen's status, there was none to be obtained from him,
strongly attracted by the young girl as he had already shown himself
to be.Indeed, she might be grateful if the attachment did not lead to
far unhappier consequences!"Larry Beers said yesterday that he had something new," she replied
irrelevantly to Kathleen's question."He has in tow a Persian dervish,
who sticks knives through his mouth, and drinks melted lead, and bites
red-hot pokers, and a lot of such things.Larry says he's the most
wonderful he's ever seen, and I'm going to have him and a real Hindu
_swami_ for next Wednesday evening."New York's conspicuous set indeed would have languished often but for
the social buffoonery of the clever Larry Beers, who devised new
diversions and stimulating mental condiments for the jaded brains of
that gilded cult.His table ballets, his bizarre parlor circuses, his
cunningly devised fads in which he set forth his own inimitable
antics, won him the motley and the cap and bells of this tinseled
court, and forced him well out into the glare of publicity, which was
what he so much desired.And by that much it made him as dangerous as any stupid anarchist who
toils by candle-light over his crude bombs.For by it he taught the
great mass of citizenship who still retained their simple ideals of
reason and respect that there existed a social caste, worshipers of
the golden calf, to whom the simple, humdrum virtues were quite
unendurable, and who, utterly devoid of conscience, would quaff
champagne and dance on the raw, quivering hearts of their fellow-men
with glee, if thereby their jaded appetites for novelty and
entertainment might be for the moment appeased.And so Larry Beers brought his _swami_ and dervish to the Ames
mansion, and caused his hostess to be well advertised in the
newspapers the following day.And he caused the eyes of Carmen to
bulge, and her thought to swell with wonder, as she gazed.And he
caused the bepowdered nose of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to stand a bit
closer to the perpendicular, while she sat devising schemes to cast a
shade over this clumsy entertainment.The chief result was that, a week later, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, still
running true to form, retorted with a superb imitation of the French
_Bal de l'Opera_, once so notable under the Empire.The Beaubien had
furnished the inspiring idea--and the hard cash."Why do I continue
to lend her money and take her notes?I don't--I don't seem to feel that way now.Or is it because I hate that Ames woman so?I wonder if I do still
hate her?At any rate I'm glad to see Carmen oust the proud hussy from
her place.It's worth all I've spent, even if I burn the notes I hold
against Jim Crowles's widow."And often after that, when at night the Beaubien had sought her bed,
she would lie for hours in the dim light meditating, wondering.I'm not the same woman I was when she came into my life.Oh,
God bless her--if there is a God!"The mock _Bal de l'Opera_ was a magnificent _fete_.All the members of
the smart set were present, and many appeared in costumes representing
flowers, birds, and vegetables.Carmen went as a white rose; and her
great natural beauty, set off by an exquisite costume, made her the
fairest flower of the whole garden.The Duke of Altern, costumed as a
long carrot, fawned in her wake throughout the evening.The tubbily
girthy Gannette, dressed to represent a cabbage, opposed her every
step as he bobbed before her, showering his viscous compliments upon
the graceful creature.Kathleen Ames appeared as a bluebird; and she
would have picked the fair white rose to pieces if she could, so
wildly jealous did she become at the sight of Carmen's further
triumph.About midnight, when the revelry was at its height, a door at the end
of the hall swung open, and a strong searchlight was turned full upon
it.The orchestra burst into the wailing dead march from _Saul_, and
out through the glare of light stalked the giant form of J. Wilton
Ames, gowned in dead black to represent a King Vulture, and with a
blood-red fez surmounting his cruel mask.As he stepped out upon the
platform which had been constructed to represent the famous bridge in
"_Sumurun_," and strode toward the main floor, a murmur involuntarily
rose from the assemblage.It was a murmur of awe, of horror, of fear.The "_monstrum horrendum_" of Poe was descending upon them in the garb
which alone could fully typify the character of the man!When he
reached the end of the bridge the huge creature stopped and distended
his enormous sable wings.cried Gannette, as he thought of his tremendous financial
obligations to Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away from the awful spectacle."I want to
go," she said to the petrified Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had known
nothing of this feature of the program.Straight to the trembling, white-clad girl the great, black vulture
stalked.The revelers fell away from him on either side as he
approached.Carmen turned again and watched him come.A light came into her eyes, and a smile
wreathed her mouth.And when Ames reached her and extended his huge,
black wings again, she walked straight into them with a look of joy
upon her beautiful face.Then the wings closed and completely hid the
fair, white form from the gaping crowd.For a few moments dead silence reigned throughout the hall.Then the
orchestra crashed, the vulture's wings slowly opened, and the girl,
who would have gone to the stake with the same incomprehensible smile,
stepped out.The black monster turned and strode silently, ominously,
back to the end of the hall, crossed the bridge, and disappeared
through the door which opened at his approach.said the shaken Gannette to his perspiring wife.That girl's done for; and Ames has taken this
way to publicly announce the fact!There was another astonished watcher in the audience that evening.It
was the eminent Monsignor Lafelle, recently back from Europe by way of
the West Indies.And after the episode just related, he approached
Carmen and Mrs."A very clever, if startling, performance," he commented; "and with
two superb actors, Mr.Ames and our little friend here," bowing over
Carmen's hand."I am _so_ glad you could accept our invitation, Monsignor.I haven't got my breath yet," panted the steaming Mrs."Do take us, Monsignor, to the refectory.A few moments later, over their iced drinks, Lafelle was relating
vivid incidents of his recent travels, and odd bits of news from
Cartagena."No, Miss Carmen," he said, in reply to her anxious
inquiries, "I did not meet the persons you have mentioned.And as for
getting up the Magdalena river, it would have been quite impossible.Dismiss from your mind all thought of going down there now.And the
little town of Simiti which you mention, I doubt not it is quite shut
off from the world by the war."Carmen turned aside that he might not see the tears which welled into
her eyes."Your entertainment, Madam," continued Lafelle, addressing the now
recovered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "is superb, as have been all of your
social projects this winter, I learn.The thought which you expressed
to me some months ago regarding Catholic activity in social matters
certainly was well founded.I perceive that our Protestant rivals have
all but retired from the field."Hawley-Crowles swelled with pride.Carmen regarded the churchman
with wonder."And have you not found a sense of peace, of satisfaction and comfort,
since you united with the true Church?""Are you not
at last at rest?""Quite so," sighed the lady, though the sigh was scarcely one of
unalloyed relief."And our little friend here--can she still
remain an alien, now that she has some knowledge of her indebtedness
to the Church?""Why--"

It was now Lafelle's turn to sigh, as he directed himself again to
Mrs."She does not see, Madam, that it was by the
ladder of Holy Church that she mounted to her present enviable social
height.""But--what--what do you mean?""May I not come and explain it to her?"Then he suddenly
thought of his last conversation with the Beaubien.But he shrugged
his shoulders, and a defiant look sat upon his features.Hawley-Crowles dared not refuse the request.She knew she was now
too deeply enmeshed for resistance, and that Lafelle's control over
her was complete--unless she dared to face social and financial ruin.And under that thought she paled and grew faint, for it raised the
curtain upon chaos and black night."Would it be convenient for me to call to-morrow afternoon?"Hawley-Crowles in a scarcely audible
voice."By the way," Lafelle said, suddenly turning the conversation, "how,
may I ask, is our friend, Madam Beaubien?"Hawley-Crowles again trembled slightly."I--I have not seen her
much of late, Monsignor," she said feebly."A strong and very liberal-minded woman," returned Lafelle with
emphasis."I trust, as your spiritual adviser, Madam, I may express
the hope that you are in no way influenced by her."cried Carmen, who had bounded to her feet, her eyes ablaze,
"Madam Beaubien is a noble woman!"Lafelle grasped her hand and drew her back into her
chair.Madam Beaubien is a very dear
friend of ours, and we greatly admire her strength of character.She
certainly does not require your defense!A few moments later he rose and offered his arms to his companions to
lead them back to the hall.Delivering Carmen into the charge of the
eagerly waiting Duke of Altern, Lafelle remarked, as he took leave of
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I trust you will permit me to talk with your
beautiful ward to-morrow afternoon--alone."And when the lady
interpreted the significance of his look, her heart beat rapidly, as
she bowed her acknowledgment of abject submission.ejaculated the young Duke, clutching Carmen."Ye know, I
was deucedly afraid you had gone home, or that Uncle Wilton had you.Ye know, I think I'm jealous of him!"Carmen laughed merrily at the fellow.His grotesque costume made him
appear still more ridiculous."It's nothing to laugh at, Miss Carmen!It's a bally bore to have a
regular mountain like him always getting in the way; and to-night I
just made up my mind I wouldn't stand it any longer, bah Jove!He fixed his monocle savagely in his eye and strode rapidly toward
the refreshment hall.She heard his murmur of
gratification when his gaze lighted upon the chairs and table which
he had evidently arranged previously in anticipation of this
_tete-a-tete_."Ye know," he finally began, after they were seated and he had sat
some minutes staring at the girl, "ye know, you're deucedly clevah,
Miss Carmen!I told mother so to-day, and this time she had to agree.And that about your being an Inca princess--ye know, I could see that
from the very first day I met you.Mighty romantic, and all that,
don't ye know!"replied the girl, her thought drifting back to distant
Simiti."And all about that mine you own in South America--and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles making you her heiress--and all that--bah Jove!It's--it's romantic, I tell you!"His head continued to nod emphasis
to his thought long after he finished speaking."Ye know," he finally resumed, drawing a gold-crested case from a
pocket and lighting a monogrammed cigarette, "a fellow can always tell
another who is--well, who belongs to the aristocracy.Ames, ye
know, said she had some suspicions about you.But I could see right
off that it was because she was jealous.Mother and I knew what you
were the minute we clapped eyes on you.That's because we belong to
the nobility, ye know.""Bah Jove, Miss Carmen, I'm going to say it!""Mother wanted me to marry Lord Cragmont's filly; but, bah Jove, I
say, I'm going to marry you!"Carmen now heard, and she quickly sat up, her eyes wide and staring.You're a princess, ye know,
and so you're in our class.I'm not one of the kind that hands out a
title to the red-nosed daughter of any American pork packer just to
get her money.The girl I marry has got to be my equal.""It's all right for you to have money, of course.I won't marry a
pauper, even if she's a duchess.But you and I, Miss Carmen, are just
suited to each other--wealth and nobility on each side.I've got
thirty thousand good British acres in my own right, bah Jove!"By now Carmen had fully recovered from her surprise.She reflected a
moment, then determined to meet the absurd youth with the spirit of
levity which his audacity merited."But, Reginald," she said in mock
seriousness, "though your father was a duke, how about your mother?Was she not just an ordinary American girl, a sister of plain Mrs.Now on my side--"

"Now, Miss Carmen," cried the boy petulantly, "can't you see that, by
marrying my father, my mother became ennobled?Bah Jove, you don't
understand!he whispered, leaning far over the table toward her."Then we've simply _got_ to marry!""But," protested the girl, "in my country people love those whom they
marry.I haven't heard a word of that from you."It was
love that made me offer you my name and title!""My dear Reginald, you don't love me.You are madly in love, it is true; but it is
with the young Duke of Altern.""See here, you can't talk to me that way, ye know!""Bah Jove, I'm offering to make you a duchess--and I love you, too,
though you may not think it!""Of course you love me, Reginald," said Carmen in gentle reply, now
relinquishing her spirit of badinage; "and I love you.But I do not
wish to marry you."The young man started under the shock and stared at her in utter lack
of comprehension.Was it possible that this unknown girl was refusing
him, a duke?"A--a--I don't get you, Miss Carmen," he stammered."Come," she said, rising and holding out a hand."Let's not talk about
this any more.I do love you, Reginald,
but not in the way that perhaps you would like.I love the real _you_;
not the vain, foolish, self-adoring human concept, called the Duke of
Altern.And the love I feel for you will help you, oh, far more than
if I married you!"I--I expected we'd be engaged--I told mother--"

"Very well, Reginald, we are engaged.Engaged in handling this little
problem that has presented itself to you.And I will help
you to solve it in the right way.Reginald dear, I
didn't mean to treat your proposal so lightly.We're just awfully good friends, aren't we?And I do
love you, more than you think."Leaving the bewildered youth in the hall, Carmen fell afoul of the
very conservative Mrs.Gannette, whose husband, suffering from a sense
of nausea since the appearance of Ames as a King Vulture, had some
moments before summoned his car and driven to his favorite club to
flood his apprehensions with Scotch high-balls.Gannette, shaking a finger at
Carmen."I saw you with Reginald just now.Tell me, dear, when shall we be able to call you the Duchess
of Altern?Carmen's spirits sank, as, without reply, she submitted to the banal
boredom of this blustering dame's society gabble.Gannette hooked
her arm into the girl's and led her to a divan."It's a great affair,
isn't it?"she panted, settling her round, unshapely form out over the
seat.Thought that was better adapted to my shape.But when
I got the cloth form around me, do you know, I couldn't get through
the door!And my unlovely pig of a husband said if I came looking like
that he'd get a divorce."The corpulent dame shook and wheezed with
the expression of her abundant merriment."Well," she continued, "it wasn't his threat that hindered me,
goodness knows!A divorce would be a relief, after living forty years
with him!Speaking of divorce,
he's just got one.Billy Patterson
dared him to exchange wives with him one evening when they were having
a little too much gaiety at the Worley home, and the doctor took the
dare.Kate Worley gets an alimony of
fifty thousand per.Why, he has a
practice of not less than two hundred and fifty thousand a year!""I supposed," murmured Carmen, "that amount of money is a measure of
his ability, a proof of his great usefulness.""He's simply in with the
wealthy, that's all.Carmen glanced at the pale, slender woman across the hall, seated
alone, and wearing a look of utter weariness."I'd like to meet her," she said, suddenly drawn by the woman's mute
appeal for sympathy."She's going to be
dropped.Hawley-Crowles was thinking of to invite her to-night!Her estate is
being handled by Ames and Company, and J. Wilton says there won't be
much left when it's settled--

"My goodness!"she exclaimed, abruptly flitting to another topic.Look at her skirt--flounced at the knees, and
full in the back so's to give a bustle effect.I wish I could wear
togs cut that way--

"They say, my dear," the garrulous old worldling prattled on, "that
next season's styles will be very ultra.Hats
small and round, like the heads of butterflies.Waists and jackets
very full and quite loose in the back and shoulders, so's to give the
appearance of wings.Belts, but no drawing in at the waist.Skirts
plaited, plaits opening wide at the knees and coming close together
again at the ankle, so's to look like the body of a butterfly.Then
butterfly bows sprinkled all over.""Oh dear," she
lamented, "I'd give anything if I had a decent shape!I'd like to wear
those shimmering, flowing, transparent summer things over silk tights.I'd look like a potato busted wide open.Now you can
wear those X-ray dresses all right--

"Say, Kathleen Ames has a new French gown to wear to the Dog Show.Skirt slit clear to the knee, with diamond garter around the leg just
below.Carmen heard little of this vapid talk, as she sat studying the pale
woman across the hall.She had resolved to meet her just as soon as
the loquacious Mrs.But that
genial old gossip gave no present evidence of a desire to change."I'm _so_ glad you're going to marry young Altern," she said, again
swerving the course of her conversation."He's got a fine old ruined
castle somewhere in England, and seems to have wads of money, though I
hear that everything is mortgaged to Ames.Still, his bare title is worth something to an American girl.And you'll do a lot for his family.You know--but
don't breathe a word of this!--his mother never was recognized
socially in England, and she finally had to give up the fight.For a
while Ames backed her, but it wouldn't do.His millions couldn't buy
her the court entree, and she just had to quit.That's why she's over
here now.The old Duke--he was lots older than she--died a couple of
years ago.Ran through everything and drank himself to death.Before
and since that happy event the Duchess did everything under the
heavens to get a bid to court.She gave millions to charity and to
entertainments.You're
a princess, royal Inca, and such like.So you see what you're expected to do for the Altern crowd--

"Dear!catching her breath and switching quickly to another
theme, "have you heard about the Hairton scandal?You see, young Sidney Ames--"

Carmen's patience had touched its limit.she
begged, holding out a hand.Gannette raised her lorgnette and looked at the girl.The scandal's about Ames's son, you know.The
reason he doesn't go in society.You see--"

"My dear Mrs.Gannette," Carmen looked up at her with a beseeching
smile."You wouldn't deliberately give me poison to drink, would
you?"blustered that garrulous lady in astonishment."Then why do you poison my mind with such conversation?""You sit there pouring into my mentality thought after thought that is
deadly poisonous, don't you know it?""You don't mean to harm me, I know," pleaded the girl."But if you
only understood mental laws you would know that every thought entering
one's mind tends to become manifested in some way.Thoughts of
disease, disaster, death, scandal--all tend to become externalized in
discordant ways, either on the body, or in the environment.You don't
want any such things manifested to me, do you?But you might just as
well hand me poison to drink as to sit there and pour such deadly
conversation into me."Gannette slowly drew herself up with the hauteur of a grandee."I do not want to listen to these unreal
things which concern only the human mind," she said earnestly."Nor
should you, if you are truly aristocratic, for aristocracy is of the
thought.I am not going to marry Reginald.But one's thought--that alone is one's claim to _real_
aristocracy.I know I have offended you, but only because I refuse to
let you poison me.She left the divan and the petrified dame, and hurriedly mingled with
the crowd on the floor.Gannette, when she again found
herself.Carmen went directly to the pale woman, still sitting alone, who had
been one of the objects of Mrs.The
woman glanced up as she saw the girl approaching, and a look of wonder
came into her eyes."I am Carmen Ariza," she said simply.The woman roused up and tried to appear composed."Will you ride with me to-morrow?""Then we can talk
all we want to, with nobody to overhear.she
abruptly added, unable longer to withstand the appeal which issued
mutely from the lusterless eyes before her."I am poverty-stricken," returned the woman sadly."But I will give you money," Carmen quickly replied."My dear child," said the woman, "I haven't anything but money.That
is why I am poverty-stricken."the girl exclaimed, sinking into a chair at her side."Well,"
she added, brightening, "now you have me!And will you call me up,
first thing in the morning, and arrange to ride with me?"Yes," she murmured, "I will--gladly."In the small hours of the morning there were several heads tossing in
stubborn wakefulness on their pillows in various New York mansions.CHAPTER 17


On the morning following Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's very successful
imitation of the _Bal de l'Opera_, Monsignor Lafelle paid an early
call to the Ames _sanctum_.And the latter gentleman deemed the visit
of sufficient importance to devote a full hour to his caller.When the
churchman rose to take his leave he reiterated:

"Our friend Wenceslas will undertake the matter for you, Mr.Ames, but
on the conditions which I have named.But Rome must be communicated
with, and the substance of her replies must be sent from Cartagena to
you, and your letters forwarded to her.That might take us into early
summer.Ketchim's engineers will
make any further attempt before that time to enter Colombia.Harris is in Denver, at his old home, you
tell me.So we need look for no immediate move from them.""Quite satisfactory, Lafelle," returned Ames genially."In future, if
I can be of service to you, I am yours to command.Willett will
hand you a check covering your traveling expenses on my behalf."When the door closed after Lafelle, Ames leaned back in his chair and
gave himself up to a moment's reflection."I wonder," he mused, "I
wonder if the fellow has something up his sleeve that he didn't show
me?I'm going to drop him after this trap is
sprung.He's got Jim Crowles's widow all tied up, too.if he begins work on that girl I'll--"

He was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone bell.shouted Ames, "you say the girl insulted your
wife last evening?I don't believe she could--Yes, yes, I mean, I
don't think she meant to--certainly not, no aspersion whatever
intended--What?the girl will have to apologize?--Well!well--No,
not in a thousand years!--Yes, I'll back her!And if your society
isn't good enough for her--and I don't think it is--why, I'll form
a little coterie all by myself!""I want a dozen brokers watching Gannette now until I call them off,"
he commanded."I want you to take personal charge of them."Lucile
already has Gannette pretty well wound up in his Venezuelan
speculations--and they are going to smash--Lafelle has fixed that.And
I've bought her notes against Mrs.Hawley-Crowles for about a
million--which I have reinvested for her in Colombia.She'll
feed out of my hand now!La Libertad is mine when the trap falls.So
is C. and R. And that little upstart, Ketchim, goes to Sing Sing!"He turned to the morning paper that lay upon his desk."I don't like
the way the Colombian revolution drags," he mused."But certainly it
can't last much longer.And then--then--"

His thoughts wandered off into devious channels."So Jose de Rincon
is--well!But--where on earth did
that girl come from?There's a lot of experience coming to
her.And then she'll drop a few of her pious notions.Lucile says--but
Lucile is getting on my nerves!"*       *       *       *       *

Monsignor Lafelle found Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward awaiting him
when his car drove up at two that afternoon.Carmen had not left the
house during the morning, for Elizabeth Wall had telephoned early that
a slight indisposition would necessitate postponement of the
contemplated ride."Well," reflected Carmen, as she turned from the 'phone, "one who
knows that God is everywhere can never be disappointed, for all good
is ever present."And then she set about preparing for the expected
call of Monsignor Lafelle.When that dignitary entered the parlor Mrs.Hawley-Crowles graciously
welcomed him, and then excused herself."I will leave her with you,
Monsignor," she said, indicating Carmen, and secretly glad to escape a
presence which she greatly feared.Lafelle bowed, and then waved
Carmen to a seat."I have come to-day, Miss Carmen," he began easily, "on a mission of
vastest importance as concerning your welfare.I have talked with the acting-Bishop there, who, it seems,
is not wholly unacquainted with you.""Then," cried Carmen eagerly, "you know where Padre Jose is?And the
others--"

"No," replied Lafelle."I regret to say I know nothing of their
present whereabouts."I have long since done that," said Carmen softly."It is of yourself that I wish to speak," continued Lafelle."I have
come to offer you the consolation, the joy, and the protection of the
Church.Hawley-Crowles, has found peace
with us.Will you longer delay taking a step toward which you are by
race, by national custom, and by your Saviour admonished?I have come
to invite you to publicly confess your allegiance to the Church of
Rome.Hawley-Crowles, is one
of us.And you, my
daughter, now need the Church," he added with suggestive emphasis.Hawley-Crowles had hinted the probable
mission of the churchman, and the girl was prepared."I thank you, Monsignor," she replied simply."My child, it is quite
necessary!""But I have my salvation, ever present."My dear child, do not lean upon your pretty theories in the hope that
they will open the door of heaven for you.There is no salvation
outside of the Church.""Monsignor," said Carmen gently, "such talk is very foolish.Can you
prove to me that your Church ever sent any one to heaven?Have you any
but a very mediaeval and material concept of heaven?It is the consciousness of good only, without a trace of
materiality or evil.And I enter into that consciousness by means of
the Christ-principle, which Jesus gave to the world.It is very
simple, is it not?And it makes all your pomp and ceremony, and your
penance and rites quite unnecessary."He had certain suspicions, but he was not
ready to voice them.Carmen went on:

"Monsignor, I love my fellow-men, oh, _so_ much!I want to see every
one work out his salvation, as Jesus bade us all do, and without any
hindrance from others.And I ask but that same privilege from every
one, yourself included.Let me work out my salvation as my Father has
directed.""I have no wish to hinder you, child.On
the contrary, I offer you the assistance and infallible guidance of
the Church.Beginning nineteen
centuries ago, when we were divinely appointed custodian of the
world's morals, our history has been a glorious one.We have in that
time changed a pagan world into one that fears God and follows His
Christ.""But for nineteen hundred years, Monsignor, the various so-called
Christian sects of the world have been persecuting and slaying one
another over their foolish beliefs, basing their religious theories
upon their interpretations of the Bible.Surely that is not a glorious
history!"You unwittingly argue directly for our cause, my child.The
result which you have just cited proves conclusively that the
Scriptures can not be correctly interpreted by every one.That is
perfectly patent to you, I see.Thus you acknowledge the necessity of
an infallible guide.That is to be found only in the spiritual
Fathers, and in the Pope, the holy Head of the Church of Rome, the
present Vicegerent of Christ on earth.""Then your interpretation of the Bible is the only correct one?""And you Catholics are the only true followers of Christ?"Come, Monsignor, I will get my coat and hat.he asked in amazement, as he slowly got to
his feet."Jesus said: 'He that believeth on
me, the works that I do shall he do also.'I am going to take you over
to the home of old Maggie, our cook's mother.You will
heal her, for you are a true follower of Christ.""Well--but, hasn't she a doctor?""Yes, but he can't help her.You should be able to do the works
which he did.You can change the wafer and wine into the flesh and
blood of Jesus.How much easier, then, and vastly more practical, to
cure a sick woman!Wait, I will be back in a minute.""But, you impetuous child, I shall go on no such foolish errand as
that!""If the woman were dying or dead, and you were
summoned, you would go, would you not?"And if she were dying you would put holy oil on her, and pray--but it
wouldn't make her well.And if she were dead, you would say Masses for
the repose of her soul.Monsignor, did it never occur to you that the
great works which you claim to do are all done behind the veil of
death?You can do but little for mankind here; but you pretend to do
much after they have passed beyond the grave.Is it quite fair to the
poor and ignorant, I ask, to work that way?Did it never strike you as
remarkable and very consistent that Jesus, whenever he launched a
great truth, immediately ratified it by some great sign, some sign
which the world now calls a miracle?The Gospels are full of such
instances, where he first taught, then came down and immediately
healed some one, thus at once putting his teaching to the proof.Your Church has taught and thundered and denounced
for ages, but what has it proved?You teach the so-called practical Christianity which makes a reality
of evil and an eternal necessity of hospitals and orphan asylums.If
you did his works the people would be so uplifted that these things
would be wiped out.Your Church has had nineteen hundred years in
which to learn to do the works which he did.Now come over to Maggie's
with me and prove that you are a true follower and believer, and that
the Church has given you the right sort of practical instruction!"Gradually the girl's voice waxed stronger while she delivered this
polemic.Slowly the churchman's face darkened, as he moved backward
and sank into his chair."Now, Monsignor, having scolded you well," the girl continued, smiling
as she sat down again, "I will apologize.But you needed the
scolding--you know you did!And nearly all who profess the name of
Christ need the same.Monsignor, I love you all, and every one,
whether Catholic or Protestant, or whatever his creed.But that does
not blind my eyes to your great need, and to your obstinate refusal to
make any effort to meet that need."A cynical look came into the man's face."May I ask, Miss Carmen, if
you consider yourself a true follower and believer?""Monsignor," she quickly replied, rising and facing him, "you hope by
that adroit question to confound me.Listen: when I was a child my purity of thought was such that I knew
no evil.I could not see sickness or
death as anything more than unreal shadows.And that wonderful
clearness of vision and purity of thought made me a channel for the
operation of the Christ-principle, God himself.And thereby the sick
were healed in my little home town.Then, little by little, after my
beloved teacher, Jose, came to me, I lost ground in my struggle to
keep the vision clear.They did not mean to, but he and my dearest
padre Rosendo and others held their beliefs of evil as a reality so
constantly before me that the vision became obscured, and the
spirituality alloyed.The unreal forces of evil seemed to concentrate
upon me.I know why now, for the greatest good always stirs up the
greatest amount of evil--the highest truth always has the lowest lie
as its opposite and opponent.I see now, as never before, the
unreality of evil.I see now, as never before, the marvelous truth
which Jesus tried, oh, _so_ hard, to impress upon the dull minds of
his people, the truth which you refuse to see.And ceaselessly I am
now striving to acquire 'that mind,' that spiritual consciousness,
which was in him.I have been
wonderfully shielded, led, and cared for.And I shall heal, some day,
as he did.I shall regain my former spirituality, for it has never
really been lost.But, Monsignor, do not ask me to come into your
Church and allow my brightening vision to become blurred by your very
inadequate concept of God--a God who is moved by the petitions of
Saints and Virgin and mortal men.Unless," she added,
brightening, "you will let me teach your Church what I know."You see," she
said, "your Church requires absolute submission to its age-worn
authority.According to you, I have nothing to give.Very well, if
your Church can receive nothing from me, and yet can give me nothing
more than its impossible beliefs, undemonstrable this side of the
grave, at least--then we must consider that a gulf is fixed between
us."Oh, Monsignor," she pleaded, after a moment's silence, "you see, do
you not?When Jesus said that he gave his disciples power over all
evil, did he not mean likewise over all physical action, and over
every physical condition?But did he mean that they alone should have
such power?No, he meant that every
one who followed him and strove ceaselessly for spirituality of
thought should acquire that spirituality, and thereby cleanse himself
of false beliefs, and make room for the Christ-principle to operate,
even to the healing of the sick, to the raising of those mesmerized by
the belief of death as a power and reality, and to the dematerializing
of the whole material concept of the heavens and earth.Can't you, a
churchman, see it?And can't you see how shallow your views are?Don't
you know that even the physical body is but a part of the human,
material concept, and therefore a part of the 'one lie' about God, who
is Spirit?"But now his time had come to speak in
rebuttal.And yet, he would make no attempt to assail her convictions.He knew well that she would not yield--at least, to-day."Miss Carmen," he said gently, "the Church is ever doing beneficent
deeds which do not come to light, and for which she receives no praise
from men.Hawley-Crowles's elevation to social
leadership came through her.There is also a rumor that the Church
afforded you an asylum on your first night in this city, when, if
ever, you needed aid.The Church shielded and cared for you even in
Simiti.Indeed, what has she not done for you?"Monsignor," replied Carmen, "I am not unmindful of the care always
bestowed upon me.But my gratitude is to my
God, who has worked through many channels to bless me.Leave it there, and fear not that I shall prove ungrateful
to Him, to whom my every thought is consecrated."Then he spoke low and earnestly, while he held
his gaze fixed upon the girl's bright eyes."Miss Carmen, if you knew
that the Church now afforded you the only refuge from the dangers that
threaten, you would turn to her as a frightened child to its mother.""I fear nothing, Monsignor," replied the girl, her face alight with a
smile of complete confidence."I am not the kind who may be driven by
fear into acceptance of undemonstrable, unfounded theological beliefs.Fear has always been a terrible weapon in the hands of those who have
sought to force their opinions upon their fellow-men.But it is
powerless to influence me.Indeed, according to the Bible
allegory, it began in the very garden of Eden, when poor, deceived
Adam confessed to God that he was afraid.If God was infinite then, as
you admit you believe Him to be now, who or what made Adam afraid?For, 'God hath not given us
the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.'"But, surely, Miss Carmen, you will not stubbornly close your eyes to
threatening evil?""Monsignor, I close my eyes to all that is unlike God.I know nothing but Him and His perfect manifestation."The picture which he and the
young girl formed was one of rare beauty and interest: he, weighted
with years, white of hair, but rugged of form, with strikingly
handsome features and kindly eyes--she, a child, delicate, almost
wraith-like, glowing with a beauty that was not of earth, and, though
untutored in the wiles of men, still holding at bay the sagacious
representative of a crushing weight of authority which reached far
back through the centuries, even to the Greek and Latin Fathers who
put their still unbroken seal upon the strange elaborations which they
wove out of the simple words of the Nazarene.When the churchman again looked up and felt himself engulfed in the
boundless love which emanated from that radiant, smiling girl, there
surged up within him a mighty impulse to go to her, to clasp her in
his arms, to fall at her feet and pray for even a mite of her own rare
spirituality.The purpose which he had that morning formulated died
within him; the final card which he would have thrown lay crushed in
his hand."The people believe you a child of the ancient Incas," he said slowly,
taking her hand."What if I should say that I know better?""I would say that you were right, Monsignor," she replied gently,
looking up into his face with a sweet smile."Then you admit the identity of your father?"The man bent for a moment over the little white hand, and then
immediately left the house.CHAPTER 18

Monsignor Lafelle in his interview with Carmen had thrown out a hint
of certain rumors regarding her; but the days passed, and the girl
awoke not to their significance.Then, one morning, her attention was
attracted by a newspaper report of the farewell address of a young
priest about to leave his flock.When she opened the paper and caught
sight of the news item she gave a little cry, and immediately forgot
all else in her absorption in the closing words:

  "--and I have known no other ambition since the day that little
  waif from a distant land strayed into my life, lighting the dead
  lamp of my faith with the torch of her own flaming spirituality.She said she had a message for the people up here.Would to God
  she might know that her message had borne fruit!"The newspaper slipped from the girl's hands to the floor.Her eyes,
big and shining, stared straight before her."And I will lead the
blind by a way that they know not--" she murmured.It was Miss Wall, ready now for the postponed
ride.Carmen clapped her hands and sang for joy as she summoned the
car and made her preparations."We'll go over to his church," she said
aloud.She hurried back to the newspaper to get the
address of the church from which he had spoken the preceding day."They will know where he is," she said happily."Oh, isn't it just
wonderful!"A few minutes later, with Miss Wall at her side, she was speeding to
the distant suburb where the little church was located."We are going to find a priest," she said simply."Oh, you mustn't ask
me any questions!Hawley-Crowles doesn't like to have me talk
about certain things, and so I can't tell you."But the happy, smiling countenance
disarmed suspicion."Now tell me," Carmen went on, "tell me about yourself.I'm a
missionary, you know," she added, thinking of Father Waite.Well, are you trying to convert the society world?""Yes, by Christianity--not by what the missionaries are now teaching
in the name of Christianity.I'll tell you all about it some day.Now
tell me, why are you unhappy?Why is your life pitched in such a minor
key?Perhaps, together, we can change it to a major."Miss Wall could not help joining in the merry laugh."I am unhappy," she said, "because I have arrived
nowhere."Carmen looked at her inquiringly."Well," she said, "that shows you
are on the wrong track, doesn't it?""I'm tired of life--tired of everything, everybody!"Miss Wall sank
back into the cushions with her lips pursed and her brow wrinkled."No, you are not tired of life," said Carmen quietly; "for you do not
know what life is.""No, I suppose not," replied the weary woman."Oh, don't mention that name, nor quote Scripture to me!"cried the
woman, throwing up her hands in exasperation."I've had that stuff
preached at me until it turned my stomach!I hope you are not an
emotional, weepy religionist."Padre Jose used to say--"

"Who's he?"demanded Miss Wall, somewhat curtly."Oh, he is a priest--"

"A priest!do you constantly associate with priests, and talk
religion?""Well," she responded, "I've had a good deal
to do with both.""Tell me something about your
life," she said."Surely I am a princess," returned Carmen, laughing merrily."Listen;
I will tell you about big, glorious Simiti, and the wonderful castle I
lived in there, and about my Prime Minister, Don Rosendo, and--well,
listen, and then judge for yourself if I am not of royal extraction!"Laughing again up into the mystified face of Miss Wall, the
enthusiastic girl began to tell about her former life in far-off
Guamoco.As she listened, the woman's eyes grew wide with interest.At times
she voiced her astonishment in sudden exclamations.And when the girl
concluded her brief recital, she bent upon the sparkling face a look
of mingled wonder and admiration.After going through all
that, how can you be so happy now?And with all your kin down there in
that awful war!"Don't you think I am a princess now?"Carmen asked, smiling up at
her."And--you don't want to know what it was that kept me through it all,
and that is still guiding me?"The bright, animated face looked so
eagerly, so lovingly, into the world-scarred features of her
companion."Not if you are going to talk religion.Tell me, who is this priest
you are seeking to-day, and why have you come to see him?"He is the one who found me--when I got lost--and took
me to my friends."The big car whirled around a corner and stopped before a dingy little
church edifice surmounted by a weather-beaten cross.On the steps of a
modest frame house adjoining stood a man.Carmen threw wide the door of the car and sprang out.A light came into the startled man's eyes.Then he
stepped back, that he might better see her.More than a year had
passed since he had taken her, so oddly garbed, and clinging tightly
to his hand, into the Ketchim office.And in that time, he thought,
she had been transformed into a vision of heavenly beauty.And
with that she threw her arms about him and kissed him loudly on both
cheeks.The man and Miss Wall gave vent to exclamations of astonishment.He
 violently; Miss Wall sat with mouth agape.pursued the girl, again grasping his
hands."An angel from heaven could not be more
welcome," he said.But his voice was low, and the note of sadness was
prominent."Well, I am an angel from heaven," said the laughing, artless girl.But,
whoever I am, I am, oh, so glad to see you again!I--" she looked
about carefully--"I read your sermon in the newspaper this morning."Yes, I meant you," he softly answered."Come with me now," said the eager girl."Impossible," he replied, shaking his head."Then, will you come and see me?""Why have
you never been to see me?Didn't you know I was still in the city?""I used to see your name in the papers, often.And I have followed your career with great interest.But--you moved in
a circle--from which I--well, it was hardly possible for me to come to
see you, you know--"

"It was!""But, never mind, you are coming now.Here," drawing a card from her bag, "this is the address of Madam
Beaubien.Will you come there to-morrow afternoon, at two, and talk
with me?"He looked at the card which she thrust into his hand, and then at the
richly-gowned girl before him.But he
nodded his head slowly."Tell me," she whispered, "how is Sister Katie?"Ah, if the girl could have known how that great-hearted old soul had
mourned her "little bairn" these many months."I will go to see her," said Carmen."But first you will come to me
to-morrow."She beamed upon him as she clasped his hands again.Then
she entered the car, and sat waving her hand back at him as long as he
could see her.It would be difficult to say which of the two, Miss Wall or Father
Waite, was the more startled by this abrupt and lively _rencontre_.But to Carmen, as she sat back in the car absorbed in thought, it had
been a perfectly natural meeting between two warm friends."You haven't anything but money, and
fine clothes, and automobiles, and jewels, you think.asked the wondering woman, marveling at this strange
girl who went about embracing people so promiscuously.The woman's lip trembled slightly when she heard this, but she did not
reply."And I'm going to love you," the girl continued.You're
tired of society gabble and gossip; you're tired of spending on
yourself the money you never earned; you're not a bit of use to
anybody, are you?You're a sort of tragedy, aren't
you?There are just lots of them in high society, just as
weary as you.And they lack the very
greatest thing in all of life, the very thing that no amount of money
will buy, just love!they don't realize that, in
order to get, they must give.In order to be loved, they must
themselves love.Now you start right in and love the whole world, love
everybody, big and little.And, as you love people, try to see only
their perfection.Never look at a bad trait, nor a blemish of any
sort.In a week's time you will be a new woman.""I have _always_ done it," replied Carmen."I don't know anything but
love.I never knew what it was to hate or revile.I never could see
what there was that deserved hatred or loathing.I don't see anything
but good--everywhere.""I--I don't mind your talking
that way to me," she whispered."But I just couldn't bear to listen to
any more religion."Love is the
tie that binds all together and all to God.Why, Miss Wall--"

"Call me Elizabeth, please," interrupted the woman."Well then, Elizabeth," she said softly, "all creeds have got to merge
into just one, some day, and, instead of saying 'I believe,' everybody
will say 'I understand and I love.'Why, the very person who loved
more than anybody else ever did was the one who saw God most clearly!He knew that if we would see God--good everywhere--we would just
simply _have_ to love, for God _is_ love!"Do you love me, Carmen, because you pity me?""God's children are not to be
pitied--and I see in people only His children.""Well, why, then, do you love me?"The girl replied quickly: "God is love."And now," she continued cheerily, "we are going to work together,
aren't we?And then you are
going to see just what is right for you to do--what work you are to
take up--what interests you are to have."Tell me, Carmen, why are you in society?What keeps you there, in an
atmosphere so unsuited to your spiritual life?""But--"

"Well, Elizabeth dear, every step I take is ordained by Him, who is my
life.I leave everything to Him, and then
keep myself out of the way.If He wishes to use me elsewhere, He will
remove me from society.How could this girl, who, in her
few brief years, had passed through fire and flood, still love the
hand that guided her!CHAPTER 19


To the great horde of starving European nobility the daughters of
American millionaires have dropped as heavenly manna.It was but dire
necessity that forced low the bars of social caste to the transoceanic
traffic between fortune and title.Hawley-Crowles might ever aspire to the purchase of a
decrepit dukedom had never entered her thought.A tottering earldom
was likewise beyond her purchasing power.She had contented herself
that Carmen should some day barter her rare culture, her charm, and
her unrivaled beauty, for the more lowly title of an impecunious count
or baron.But to what heights of ecstasy did her little soul rise when
the young Duke of Altern made it known to her that he would honor her
beautiful ward with his own glorious name--in exchange for La Libertad
and other good and valuable considerations, receipt of which would be
duly acknowledged."I--aw--have spoken to her, ye know, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," that worthy
young cad announced one afternoon, as he sat alone with the successful
society leader in the warm glow of her living room.she said we were engaged, ye know--really!Said we were awfully good
friends, ye know, and all that.For Reginald had done much thinking of late--and his creditors were
restless.Hawley-Crowles,
beaming like a full-blown sunflower.Only--ye know, she'll have to be--coached a bit, ye
know--told who we are--our ancestral history, and all that.Why, she just couldn't help loving you!""No--aw--no, of course--that is--aw--she has excellent
prospects--financial, I mean, eh?Mines, and all that, ye know--eh?""Why, she owns the grandest gold mine in all South America!I--aw--I never was so attracted to a girl in all me
blooming life!You will--a--speak to her, eh?"Never fear, Reginald" she's yours.Certainly not--not when she knows about our family.And--aw--mother will talk with you--that is, about the details.She'll
arrange them, ye know.And the haughty mother of the young Duke did call shortly thereafter
to consult in regard to her son's matrimonial desires.The nerve-racking
round of balls, receptions, and other society functions was quite
forgotten by the elated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose ears tingled
deliciously under the pompous boastings of the Dowager Lady Altern.Hawley-Crowles was convinced, after a
half hour's conversation with this proud mother, that the royal house
of Brunswick was but an impudent counterfeit!Reed, who had
hastily appraised it, had said that there was a mountain of gold there,
only awaiting Yankee enterprise.There was proof positive
that she was an Inca princess.Hawley-Crowles was so honored
by the deep interest which the young Duke manifested in the wonderful
girl!And she would undertake negotiations with her at once.Hawley-Crowles had to plan very carefully.She was terribly
in debt; yet she had resources.The Beaubien was inexhaustible.Ames,
too, might be depended upon.And La Libertad--well, there was Mr.Philip O. Ketchim to reckon with.So she forthwith summoned him to a
consultation.But, ere her talk with that prince of finance, another bit of good
fortune fell into the lady's spacious lap.Reed had written that he
was doing poorly with his western mining ventures, and would have to
raise money at once.He therefore offered to sell his interest in the
Simiti Company.Moreover, he wanted his wife to come to him and make
her home in California, where he doubtless would spend some years.Hawley-Crowles offered him twenty-five thousand dollars for his
Simiti interest; of which offer Reed wired his immediate acceptance.Then the lady packed her rueful sister Westward Ho!and laid her newly
acquired stock before the Beaubien for a large loan.That was but a
day before Ketchim called."Madam," said that suave gentleman, smiling piously, "you are a
genius.Our ability to announce the Duke of Altern as our largest
stockholder will result in a boom in the sales of Simiti stock.The
Lord has greatly prospered our humble endeavors.Er--might I ask,
Madam, if you would condescend to meet my wife some afternoon?We are
rapidly acquiring some standing in a financial way, and Mrs.Ketchim
would like to know you and some of the more desirable members of your
set, if it might be arranged."Hawley-Crowles beamed her joy.She drew herself up with a regnant
air.The people were coming to her, their social queen, for
recognition!"And there's my Uncle Ted, you know, Madam.He's president of the C.
and R."Hawley-Crowles nodded and looked wise."Possibly we can arrange
it," she said.What is Joplin
Zinc doing?"The lady wondered, for Joplin Zinc was not yet in operation, according
to the latest report.*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, while Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was still laying her plans to herd
the young girl into the mortgaged dukedom of Altern, Father Waite kept
his appointment, and called at the Beaubien mansion on the afternoon
Carmen had set.He was warmly received by the girl herself, who had
been watching for his coming."Now," she began like a bubbling fountain, when they were seated in
the music room, "where's Jude?Why, I haven't the slightest idea to whom you refer," returned
the puzzled man."The woman who took me to the Sister Superior," explained Carmen."Well," said the girl confidently, "I saw her, but she got away from
me.But I shall find her--it is right that I should.Now tell me, what
are you going to do?"Earn my living some way," he replied meditatively."You have lots of friends who will help you?""I am an apostate, you know.""Well, that means that you're free.The chains have dropped, haven't
they?""You are not dazed, nor confused!Why, you're like a prisoner coming
out of his dungeon into the bright sunlight.You're only blinking,
that's all.And, as for confusion--well, if I would admit it to be
true I could point to a terrible state of it!Just think, a duke wants
to marry me; Mrs.Hawley-Crowles is determined that he shall; I am an
Inca princess, and yet I don't know who I am; my own people apparently
are swallowed up by the war in Colombia; and I am in an environment
here in New York in which I have to fight every moment to keep myself
from flying all to pieces!But I guess God intends to keep me here for
the present.Oh, yes, and Monsignor Lafelle insists that I am a
Catholic and that I must join his Church.""Is Monsignor Lafelle working with
Madam Beaubien, your friend?"Hawley-Crowles--"

"Was it through him that she became a communicant?"Ames's sister, the Dowager Duchess, in England.The young Duke is also
going to join the faith, I learn.He stopped suddenly and
looked searchingly at her.At that moment a maid entered, bearing a card.Close on her heels
followed the subject of their conversation, Monsignor himself.As he entered, Carmen rose hastily to greet him.Then, as he straightened up, his glance fell upon Father Waite.For a moment the two men stood
eying each other sharply.Then Lafelle looked from Father Waite to
Carmen quizzically."I beg your pardon," he said, "I was not aware
that you had a caller.Madam Beaubien, is she at home?"murmured Lafelle, looking significantly from the girl to Father
Waite, while a smile curled his lips.He bowed again, and turned toward the exit.She had caught the
churchman's insinuating glance and instantly read its meaning."Monsignor Lafelle, you will remain!"The churchman's brows arched with surprise, but he came back and stood
by the chair which she indicated."And first," went on the girl, standing before him like an incarnate
Nemesis, her face flushed and her eyes snapping, "you will hear from
me a quotation from the Scripture, on which you assume to be
authority: 'As a man thinketh in his heart, so _is_ he!'"Finally a bland
smile spread over his features, and he sat down."Now, Monsignor Lafelle," she continued severely, "you have urged me
to unite with your Church.When you asked me to subscribe to your
beliefs I looked first at them, and then at you, their product.You
have come here this afternoon to plead with me again.The thoughts
which you accepted when you saw Father Waite here alone with me, are
they a reflection of love, which thinketh no evil?Or do they reflect
the intolerance, the bigotry, the hatred of the carnal mind?You told
me that your Church would not let me teach it.Think you I will let it
or you teach me?"Father Waite sat amazed at the girl's stinging rebuke.When she
concluded he rose to go.You have left the Church
of which Monsignor Lafelle is a part.Either you have done that
Church, and him, a great injustice--or he does ignorant or wilful
wrong in insisting that I unite with it.""My dear child," said Lafelle gently, now recovered and wholly on his
guard, "your impetuosity gets the better of your judgment.This is no
occasion for a theological discussion, nor are you sufficiently
informed to bear a part in such.As for myself, you unintentionally do
me great wrong.As I have repeatedly told you, I seek only your
eternal welfare.Else would I not labor with you as I do.""Is my eternal welfare dependent upon
acceptance of the Church's doctrines?""No," he said, in a scarcely audible voice.A cynical look came into Lafelle's eyes.But he replied affably: "When
preachers fall out, the devil falls in.Waite, comes
quite consistently from one who has impudently tossed aside
authority.""My authority, Monsignor," returned the ex-priest in a low tone, "is
Jesus Christ, who said: 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.'"murmured Lafelle; "then it was love that prompted you to abandon
your little flock?""I left my pulpit, Monsignor, because I had nothing to give my people.I no longer believe the dogmas of the Church.And I refused longer to
take the poor people's money to support an institution so politically
religious as I believe your Church to be.I could no longer take their
money to purchase the release of their loved ones from an imagined
purgatory--a place for which there is not the slightest Scriptural
warrant--"

"You mistake, sir!""Very well, Monsignor," replied Father Waite; "grant, then, that there
is such Scriptural warrant; I would nevertheless know that the
existence of purgatory was wholly incompatible with the reign of an
infinite God of love.And, knowing that, I have ceased to extort gifts
of money from the ignorance of the living and the ghastly terrors of
the dying--"

"And so deceive yourself that you are doing a righteous act in
removing their greatest consolation," the churchman again interrupted,
a sneer curving his lip.The consolation which the stupifying drug affords, yes!Ah, Monsignor, as I looked down into the faces of my poor people, week
after week, I knew that no sacerdotal intervention was needed to remit
their sins, for their sins were but their unsolved problems of life.Oh, the poor, grief-stricken mothers who bent their tear-stained eyes
upon me as I preached the 'authority' of the Fathers!Well I knew
that, when I told them from my pulpit that their deceased infants, if
baptized, went straight to heaven, they blindly, madly accepted my
words!And when I went further and told them that their dead babes had
joined the ranks of the blessed, and could thenceforth be prayed to,
could I wonder that they rejoiced and eagerly grasped the false
message of cheer?They believed because they wanted it to be so.And
yet those utterances of mine, based upon the accepted doctrine of
Holy Church, were but narcotics, lulling those poor, afflicted minds
into a false sense of rest and security, and checking all further
human progress.""It is to be regretted," he said
coldly, "that such narrowness of view should be permitted to impede
the salvation of souls.""Ah, how many souls
have I not saved!--and yet I know not whether they or I be really
saved!From misery,
disease, suffering in this life?Ah, my friend, saved only from the torments of a hell and a purgatory
constructed in the fertile minds of busy theologians!""Some other day, perhaps--when it may be
more convenient for us both--and you are alone--"

Carmen laughed."Don't quit the field, Monsignor--unless you surrender
abjectly.And you were quite
indiscreet, if you will recall.""You write my faults in brass," he gently
lamented."When you publish my virtues, if you find that I am
possessed of any, I fear you will write them in water.""Your virtues should advertise themselves,
Monsignor.""Ah, then do you not see in me the virtue of desiring your welfare
above all else, my child?""And the welfare of this great country, which you have come here to
assist in making dominantly Catholic, is it not so, Monsignor?"Then he smiled genially back at the girl."It is an ambition which I am not ashamed to own," he returned
gently."But, Monsignor," Carmen continued earnestly, "are you not aware of
the inevitable failure of your mission?Do you not know that mediaeval
theology comports not with modern progress?""True, my child," replied the churchman."And more, that our
so-called modern progress--modernism, free-thinking, liberty of
conscience, and the consequent terrible extravagance of beliefs and
false creeds--constitutes the greatest menace now confronting this
fair land."Monsignor," said Carmen, "in the Middle Ages the Church was supreme.Emperors and kings bowed in submission before her.Would you be willing, for the sake of Church
supremacy to-day, to return to the state of society and civilization
then obtaining?"I point you to Mexico, Cuba, the Philippines, South America, all
Catholic now or formerly, and I ask if you attribute not their
oppression, their ignorance, their low morals and stunted manhood, to
the dominance of churchly doctrines, which oppose freedom of
conscience and press and speech, and make learning the privilege of
the clergy and the rich?""It is an old argument, child," deprecated Lafelle."May I not point
to France, on the contrary?""She has all but driven the Church from her borders.""And England, though Anglican,
calls herself Catholic.Germany is
forsaking Luther, as she sees the old light shining still undimmed."The latter read in her glance an
invitation further to voice his own convictions."Monsignor doubtless misreads the signs of the times," he said slowly."The hour has struck for the ancient and materialistic theories
enunciated with such assumption of authority by ignorant, often
blindly bigoted theologians, to be laid aside.The religion of our
fathers, which is our present-day evangelical theology, was derived
from the traditions of the early churchmen.They put their seal upon
it; and we blindly accept it as authority, despite the glaring,
irrefutable fact that it is utterly undemonstrable.Why do the people
continue to be deceived by it?only because of its mesmeric
promise of immortality beyond the grave."Monsignor bowed stiffly in the direction of Father Waite."Fortunately,
your willingness to plunge the Christian world into chaos will fail of
concrete results," he said coldly."I but voice the sentiments of millions, Monsignor.For them, too, the
time has come to put by forever the paraphernalia of images, candles,
and all the trinkets used in the pagan ceremonial which has so
quenched our spirituality, and to seek the undivided garment of the
Christ.""The world to-day, Monsignor, stands at the door of a new era, an era
which promises a grander concept of God and religion, the tie which
binds all to Him, than has ever before been known.And we are at
last beginning to work with true scientific precision and system.As
in chemistry, mathematics, and the physical sciences, so in matters
religious, we are beginning to _prove_ our working hypotheses.And so
a new spiritual enlightenment is come.People are awaking to a dim
perception of the meaning of spiritual life, as exemplified in Jesus
Christ.And they are vaguely beginning to see that it is possible to
every one.The abandonment of superstition, religious and other, has
resulted in such a sudden expansion of the human mind that the most
marvelous material progress the world has ever witnessed has come
swiftly upon us, and we live more intensely in a single hour to-day
than our fathers lived in weeks before us.Oh, yes, we are already
growing tired of materiality.But, Monsignor, let not the Church boast itself that the
acceptance of her mediaeval dogmas will meet the world's great need.That need will be met, I think, only as we more and more clearly
perceive the tremendous import of the mission of Jesus, and learn how
to grasp and apply the marvelous Christ-principle which he used and
told us we should likewise employ to work out our salvation."During Father Waite's earnest talk Lafelle sat with his eyes fixed
upon Carmen.When the ex-priest concluded, the churchman ignored him
and vouchsafed no reply.said the girl, after waiting some moments in
expectation.Then, nodding his shapely head, he said in
a pleading tone:

"Have I no champion here?Would you, too, suddenly abolish the Church,
Catholic and Protestant alike?Why, my dear child, with your
ideals--which no one appreciates more highly than I--do you continue
to persecute me so cruelly?Can not you, too, sense the unsoundness of
the views just now so eloquently voiced?"You speak wholly without authority or proof,
as is your wont.""Well," he said, "there are several hundred
million Catholics and Protestants in the world to-day.Would you
presume to say that they are all mistaken, and that you are right?Indeed, I think you set the
Church an example in that respect.""Monsignor, there were once several hundred millions who believed that
the earth was flat, and that the sun revolved about it.But the--"

"And, Monsignor, there are billions to-day who believe that matter is
a solid, substantial reality, and that it possesses life and
sensation.There are billions who believe that the physical eyes see,
and the ears hear, and the hands feel.Yet these beliefs are all
capable of scientific refutation."I am not unacquainted with philosophical speculation," he returned
suggestively."This is not mere speculation, Monsignor," put in Father Waite."The
beliefs of the human mind are its fetish.Such beliefs become in time
national customs, and men defend them with frenzy, utterly wrong and
undemonstrable though they be.Then they remain as the incubus of true
progress.By them understanding becomes degraded, and the human mind
narrows and shrinks.And the mind that clings to them will then
mercilessly hunt out the dissenting minds of its heretical neighbors
and stone them to death for disagreeing.So now, you would stone me
for obeying Christ's command to take up my bed on the Sabbath day.""Still you blazon my faults," he said in
a tone of mock sadness, and addressing Carmen."But, like the Church
which you persecute, I shall endure.We have been martyred throughout
the ages.Our wayward children forsake us,"
nodding toward Father Waite, "and yet we welcome their return when
they have tired of the husks.The press teems with slander against us;
we are reviled from east to west.But our reply is that such slander
and untruth can best be met by our leading individual lives of such an
exemplary nature as to cause all men to be attracted by our holy
light.""I agree with you, Monsignor," quickly replied Carmen."Scurrilous
attacks upon the Church but make it a martyr.Vilification returns
upon the one who hurls the abuse.One can not fling mud without
soiling one's hands.I oppose not men, but human systems of thought.Whatever is good will stand, and needs no defense.And there is no excuse, for salvation is at hand.""_Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts_,"
she replied earnestly."_To him that soweth righteousness_--right
thinking--_shall be a sure reward_.Ah, Monsignor, do you at heart
believe that the religion of the Christ depends upon doctrines, signs,
dogmas?But signs and proofs naturally and inevitably
follow the right understanding of Jesus' teachings, even according to
these words: _These signs shall follow them that believe_.Paul gave the
formula for salvation, when he said: _But we all with open face beholding
as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord_.Can you see that, taking Jesus as our model and
following his every command--seeing Him only, the Christ-principle, which
is God, good, without any admixture of evil--we change, even though
slowly, from glory to glory, step by step, until we rise out of all
sense of evil and death?And this is done by the Spirit which is God.""Yes," said Father Waite, taking up the conversation when she paused."Even the poorest human being can understand that.Why, then, the
fungus growth of traditions, ceremonies, rites and forms which have
sprung up about the Master's simple words?Why the wretched
formalistic worship throughout the world?Why the Church's frigid,
lifeless traditions, so inconsistent with the enlarging sense of God
which marks this latest century?The Church has yet to prove its
utility, its right to exist and to pose as the religious teacher of
mankind.Else must it fall beneath the axe which is even now at the
root of the barren tree of theology.Her theology, like the Judaism of
the Master's day, has no prophets, no poets, no singers.And her
priests, as in his time, have sunk into a fanatical observance of
ritual and form.""And yet," observed Carmen, "you still urge me to unite with it."Moreover, it irked him sore to be made a
target for the unassailable logic of the apostate Waite.Then, too,
the appearance of the ex-priest there that afternoon in company with
this girl who held such radical views regarding religious matters
portended in his thought the possibility of a united assault upon the
foundations of his cherished system.She
nettled and exasperated him.Did he
have the power to silence her?he asked, with a show of gaiety."Yes," replied Carmen, "you may go now."He, Monsignor, a dignitary of
Holy Church?He turned upon the girl and her
companion, furious with anger."I have been very patient with you both," he said in a voice that he
could not control.Abuse the Church
as you will, the fact remains that the world fears her and trembles
before her awful voice!Because the world recognizes her mighty
power, a power of unified millions of human beings and exhaustless
wealth.She is the leader, the guide, the teacher, the supreme object
of worship of a countless army who would lay down their lives to-day
for her.Her subjects gather from every quarter of the globe.They are
English, French, German, American--_but they are Catholics first_!Emperor, King, Ruler, or Government--all are alike subject to her
supreme, divine authority!Nationalities, customs, family ties--all
melt away before her, to whom her followers bow in loyal consecration.The power which her supreme leader and head wields is all but
omnipotent!He is by divine decree Lord of the world.Hundreds of
millions bend before his throne and offer him their hearts and swords!I say, you have good reason to quake!The onward march of Holy Church is not disturbed by the croaking
calumnies of such as you who would assault her!And to you I say,
beware!"His face was purple, as he stopped and mopped his damp brow."What we have to beware of, Monsignor," said Father Waite gravely, "is
the steady encroachments of Rome in this country, with her weapons of
fear, ignorance, and intolerance--"

"Intolerance!Why, in this country, whose
Constitution provided toleration for every form of religion--"

Carmen had risen and gone to the man."Monsignor," she said, "the
founders of the American nation did provide for religious tolerance--and
they were wise according to their light.But we of this day are
still wiser, for we have some knowledge of the wonderful working of
mental laws.I, too, believe in toleration of opinion.You are
welcome to yours, and I to mine.But--and here is the great point--the
opinion which Holy Church has held throughout the ages regarding those
who do not accept her dogmas is that they are damned, that they are
outcasts of heaven, that they merit the stake and rack.The Church's
hatred of heretics has been deadly.Her thought concerning them has
not been that of love, such as Jesus sent out to all who did not
agree with him, but deadly, suggestive hatred.Now our Constitution
does not provide for tolerance of hate and murder-thoughts, which enter
the minds of the unsuspecting and work destruction there in the form
of disease, disaster, and death.That is what we object to in you,
Monsignor.And toward such thoughts we have a right to be very intolerant, even to
the point of destroying them in human mentalities.Again I say, I war
not against people, but against the murderous carnal thought of the
human mind!"Monsignor had fallen back before the girl's strong words.His face
had grown black, and his hands were working convulsively."Monsignor," continued Carmen in a low, steady voice, "you have
threatened me with something which you apparently hold over me.You
are very like the people of Galilee: if you can not refute by reason,
you would circumvent by law, by the Constitution, by Congress.Instead of threatening us with the flames
of hell for not being good, why do you not show us by the great
example of Jesus' love how to be so?Are you manifesting love now--or
the carnal mind?I judge your Church by such as manifest it to me.How, then, shall I judge it by you to-day?"He rose slowly and took her by the hand."I beg your pardon," he said
in a strange, unnatural voice.And I assure you that you quite
misunderstand me, and the Church which I represent."Surely, Monsignor," returned the girl heartily."A debate such as
this is stimulating, don't you think so?""Ah, Monsignor," she said lightly, as she stepped into the room.Why have you avoided me since your return to America?""Madam," replied Lafelle, in some confusion, "no one regrets more than
I the press of business which necessitated it.But your little friend
has told me I may return.""Always welcome, Monsignor," replied the Beaubien, scanning him
narrowly as she accompanied him to the door."By the way, you forgot
our little compact, did you not?""Madam, I came out of a sense of duty.""Of that I have no doubt, Monsignor.She returned again to the music room, where Carmen made her acquainted
with Father Waite, and related the conversation with Lafelle.While
the girl talked the Beaubien's expression grew serious.Then Carmen
launched into her association with the ex-priest, concluding with:
"And he must have something to do, right away, to earn his living!"She always did when Carmen, no matter how
serious the conversation, infused her sparkling animation into it."That isn't nearly as important as to know what he thinks about
Monsignor's errand here this afternoon, dearie," she said."Madam," he said with great seriousness, "I would
be very wide awake."The Beaubien studied him for a moment."I think--I think--" He hesitated, and looked at Carmen."I think he--has been greatly angered by--this girl--and by my
presence here."Then abruptly: "What are you going to do
now?""I have funds enough to keep me some weeks, Madam, while making plans
for the future.""Then remain where I can keep in touch with you."For the Beaubien had just returned from a two hours' ride with J.
Wilton Ames, and she felt that she needed a friend.CHAPTER 20


The Beaubien sat in the rounded window of the breakfast room.Carmen
nestled at her feet.The maid had just removed the remains of the
light luncheon."Dearest, please, _please_ don't look so serious!"The Beaubien twined her fingers through the girl's flowing locks."I
will try, girlie," she said, though her voice broke.Carmen looked up into her face with a wistful yearning."Ever since Monsignor Lafelle and Father Waite
were here you have been so quiet; and that was nearly a week ago.I
know I can help, if you will only let me.""By knowing that God is everywhere, and that evil is unreal and
powerless," came the quick, invariable reply.Why, if I were chained to a stake, with fire all around me, I'd
know it wasn't true!""I think you are chained--and the fire has been kindled," said the
woman in a voice that fell to a whisper."Then your thought is wrong--all wrong!And wrong thought just _can't_
be externalized to me, for I know that 'There shall no mischief happen
to the righteous,' that is, to the right-thinking.The Beaubien got up and walked slowly around
the room, as if to summon her strength."I'm going to tell you," she said firmly."You are right, and I have
been wrong.I--I
have lost a great deal of money."I have discovered in the past few months that there are better
things in life.But--" her lips tightened, and her eyes half
closed--"he can _not_ have you!"Listen, child: I know not why it is, but you awaken something in
every life into which you come.The woman I was a year ago and the
woman I am to-day meet almost as strangers now.The only answer I
can give is, you.I don't know what you did to people in South
America; I can only surmise.Yet of this I am certain, wherever you
went you made a path of light.But the effect you have on people
differs with differing natures.Just why this is, I do not know.It
must have something to do with those mental laws of which I am so
ignorant, and of which you know so much."Carmen looked at her in wondering anticipation.The Beaubien smiled
down into the face upturned so lovingly, and went on:

"From what you have told me about your priest, Jose, I know that you
were the light of his life.He loved you to the complete obliteration
of every other interest.You have not said so; but I know it.How,
indeed, could it be otherwise?On the other hand, that heartless
Diego--his mad desire to get possession of you was only animal.Why
should you, a child of heaven, arouse such opposite sentiments?""Dearest," said the girl, laying her head on the woman's knees, "that
isn't what's worrying you.""No--but I think of it so often.And, as for me, you have turned me
inside-out.""Well, I think this side wears better,
don't you?""It is softer--it may not," returned the woman gently."But I have no
desire to change back."Ames
and I have been--no, not friends.I had no higher ideals than he, and
I played his game with him.And at a time when he had
involved me heavily financially.The Colombian revolution--his cotton
deal--he must have foreseen, he is so uncanny--he must have known that
to involve me meant control whenever he might need me!He needs me
now, for I stand between him and you.""God stands between me and every
form of evil!"She sat down on the arm of the Beaubien's chair."Is it
because you will not let him have me that he threatens to ruin you
financially?"He couldn't ruin me in reputation, for--" her voice again faded
to a whisper, "I haven't any."cried the girl, throwing her arms about the
woman's neck."Your true self is just coming to light!The Beaubien suddenly burst into a flood of tears.The strain of weeks
was at last manifesting."Oh, I have been in the gutter!--he dragged
me through the mire!--and I let him!I schemed and plotted with him; I ruined and pillaged
with him; I murdered reputations and blasted lives with him, that I
might get money, dirty, blood-stained money!Oh, Carmen, I didn't know
what I was doing, until you came!And now I'd hang on the cross if I
could undo it!And he has you and me in his
clutches, and he is crushing us!"She bent her head and sobbed
violently."Be still, and _know_ that I am
God."The Beaubien raised her head and smiled feebly through her
tears."He governs all, dearest," whispered Carmen, as she drew the woman's
head to her breast.cried the Beaubien, starting up.No, we will stay and meet them, right here!"The Beaubien's hand shook as she clasped Carmen's."I can't turn to
Kane, nor to Fitch, nor Weston.I've
ruined Gannette myself--for him!Hawley-Crowles--"

"Mrs.sobbed the suffering woman, clinging to the girl."I lent her money--took her notes--which I sold again to Mr."Well, you can buy them back, can't you?"Most that I have is mortgaged to him on the investments I made at his
direction," wailed the woman."I will try--I am trying, desperately!But--there is Monsignor Lafelle!"And I'm sure he holds something over
you and me.But, I will send for him--I will renew my vows to his
Church--anything to--"

"Listen, dearest," interrupted Carmen.If I am the cause of it all, I can--"

"You will not!"The desperate woman put her head in the girl's lap and sobbed
bitterly."There is a way out, dearest," whispered Carmen."I _know_ there is,
no matter what seems to be or to happen, for 'underneath are the
everlasting arms.'Hawley-Crowles told me this
morning that Mrs.Ames intends to give a big reception next week.And--it will be right, I
know."And Carmen sat with the repentant woman all that day, struggling with
her to close the door upon her sordid past, and to open it wide to
"that which is to come."*       *       *       *       *

The days following were busy ones for many with whom our story is
concerned.Every morning saw Carmen on her way to the Beaubien, to
comfort and advise.Every afternoon found her yielding gently to the
relentless demands of society, or to the tiresome calls of her
thoroughly ardent wooer, the young Duke of Altern.Carmen would have
helped him if she could.But she found so little upon which to build.And she bore with him largely on account of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, for
whom she and the Beaubien were now daily laboring.The young man
tacitly assumed proprietorship over the girl, and all society was agog
with expectation of the public announcement of their engagement.Hawley-Crowles still came and went upon a tide of unruffled joy.The cornucopia of Fortune lay full at her feet.Her broker, Ketchim,
basked in the sunlight of her golden smiles--and quietly sold his own
Simiti stock on the strength of her patronage.Society fawned and
smirked at her approach, and envied her brilliant success, as it
copied the cut of her elaborate gowns--all but the deposed Mrs.Ames
and her unlovely daughter, who sulked and hated, until they received a
call from Monsignor Lafelle.This was shortly after that gentleman's
meeting with Carmen and Father Waite in the Beaubien mansion.And he
left the Ames home with an ominous look on his face."The girl is a
menace," he muttered, "and she deserves her fate."The Ames grand reception, promising to be the most brilliant event of
the year, barring the famous _Bal de l'Opera_, was set for Thursday.Hawley-Crowles nor Carmen had received invitations.To the former it was evident that there was some mistake."For it
can't be possible that the hussy doesn't intend to invite us!"Hawley-Crowles
drenched with tears of anxiety and vexation."I'd call her up and ask,
if I dared," she groaned.And, to the
amazement of the exclusive set, the brilliant function was held
without the presence of its acknowledged leaders, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
and her ward, the Inca princess.*       *       *       *       *

On Wednesday night Harris arrived from Denver.His arrival was
instantly made known to J. Wilton Ames, who, on the morning following,
summoned both him and Philip O. Ketchim to his private office.There
were present, also, Monsignor Lafelle and Alonzo Hood.The latter was observed to change color as he
timidly entered the room and faced the waiting audience."Be seated, gentlemen," said Ames genially, after cordially shaking
hands with them and introducing the churchman.Then, turning to
Harris, "You are on your way to Colombia, I learn.Going down to
inaugurate work on the Simiti holdings, I suppose?"Harris threw a quick glance at Ketchim.The latter sat blank,
wondering if there were any portions of the earth to which Ames's long
arms did not reach."As a matter of fact," Ames continued, leaning back in his chair and
pressing the tips of his fingers together before him, "a hitch seems
to have developed in Simiti proceedings.Ketchim," turning suddenly and sharply upon that gentleman, "because
my brokers have picked up for me several thousand shares of the
stock.""But," proceeded Ames calmly, "now that I have put money into it, I
learn that the Simiti Company has no property whatever in Colombia."A haze slowly gathered before Ketchim's eyes."How do you make that out, Mr.he
heard Harris say in a voice that seemed to come from an infinite
distance."I myself saw the title papers which old Rosendo had, and
saw them transferred to Mr.Moreover,
I personally visited the mine in question."The
property was relocated by this Rosendo, and he secured title to it
under the name of the Chicago mine.It was that name which deceived
the clerks in the Department of Mines in Cartagena, and caused them to
issue title, not knowing that it really was the famous old La
Libertad.""Well, I don't see that there is any ground for confusion.""Simply this," returned Ames evenly: "La Libertad mine, since the
death of its former owner, Don Ignacio de Rincon, has belonged to the
Church.""By what right does it belong to the
Church?""By the ancient law of _'en manos muertas'_, my friend," replied Ames,
unperturbed."Our friend, Monsignor Lafelle, representing the Church, will
explain," said Ames, waving a hand toward that gentleman."I deeply regret this unfortunate
situation, gentlemen," he began.Ames has pointed out,
the confusion came about through issuing title to the mine under the
name Chicago.Don Ignacio de Rincon, long before his departure from
Colombia after the War of Independence, drew up his last will, and,
following the established custom among wealthy South Americans of that
day, bequeathed this mine, La Libertad, and other property, to the
Church, invoking the old law of _'en manos muertas'_ which, being
translated, means, 'in dead hands.'Pious Catholics of many lands have
done the same throughout the centuries.Such a bequest places property
in the custody of the Church; and it may never be sold or disposed of
in any way, but all revenue from it must be devoted to the purchase of
Masses for the souls in purgatory.It was through the merest chance, I
assure you, that your mistake was brought to light.Ames, had purchased stock in your company, I took the
pains to investigate while in Cartagena recently, and made the
discovery which unfortunately renders your claim to the mine quite
null."turning savagely
upon the paralyzed Ketchim."That," interposed Ames with cruel significance, "is a matter which he
will explain in court."Fleeting visions of the large blocks of stock which he had sold; of
the widows, orphans, and indigent clergymen whom he had involved; of
the notes which the banks held against him; of his questionable deals
with Mrs.Hawley-Crowles; and of the promiscuous peddling of his own
holdings in the now ruined company, rushed over the clouded mind of
this young genius of high finance.His tongue froze, though his
trembling body dripped with perspiration.Somehow he found the door, and groped his way to a descending
elevator.And somehow he lived through that terror-haunted day and
night.But very early next morning, while his blurred eyes were drinking in
the startling report of the Simiti Company's collapse, as set forth in
the newspaper which he clutched in his shaking hand, the maid led in a
soft-stepping gentleman, who laid a hand upon his quaking shoulder and
read to him from a familiar-looking document an irresistible
invitation to take up lodgings in the city jail.*       *       *       *       *

There were other events forward at the same time, which came to light
that fateful next day.Hawley-Crowles, after a
night of mingled worry and anger over the deliberate or unintentional
exclusion of herself and Carmen from the Ames reception the preceding
night, descended to her combined breakfast and luncheon.At her plate
lay the morning mail, including a letter from France.She tore it
open, hastily scanned it, then dropped with a gasp into her chair."Father--married to--a French--adventuress!The long-cherished hope of a speedy inheritance of his snug fortune
lay blasted at her feet.The telephone bell rang sharply, and she rose dully to answer it.The
call came from the city editor of one of the great dailies."It is
reported," said the voice, "that your ward, Miss Carmen Ariza, is the
illegitimate daughter of a <DW64> priest, now in South America.We
would like your denial, for we learn that it was for this reason that
you and the young lady were not included among the guests at the Ames
reception last evening."Hawley-Crowles's legs tottered under her, as she blindly wandered
from the telephone without replying.Carmen--the daughter of a priest!Her father a <DW64>--her mother, what?The stunned woman mechanically took up the morning paper which lay on
the table.Her glance was at once attracted to the great headlines
announcing the complete exposure of the Simiti bubble.Her eyes nearly
burst from her head as she grasped its fatal meaning to her.With a
low, inarticulate sound issuing from her throat, she turned and groped
her way back to her boudoir.*       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, the automobile in which Carmen was speeding to the
Beaubien mansion was approached by a bright, smiling young woman, as
it halted for a moment at a street corner.Carmen recognized her as
a reporter for one of the evening papers, who had called often at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion that season for society items."I was on my way
to see you.Our office received a report this morning from some source
that your father--you know, there has been some mystery about your
parentage--that he was really a priest, of South America.His
name--let me think--what did they say it was?"The problem
of her descent had really become a source of amusement to her."It began with a D, if I am not mistaken.I'm not up on Spanish
names," the young woman returned pleasantly."Well, I'm sure I can't say."But--you think it was, don't you?""Well, I don't believe it was Padre Diego--he wasn't a good man."I was in his house, in Banco.He used to insist that I
was his child."By the way, you knew a woman named Jude, didn't you?But she took you out of a house down on--"

"Yes.And I've tried to find her ever since.""You know Father Waite, too, the ex-priest?""You and he going to work together, I suppose?""Why, I'm sure I don't know.You think this Diego might
have been your father?That is, you can't say positively that he
wasn't?"You can come up to the
house and talk about South America, if you want to."She nodded pleasantly, and the car moved away.The innocent, ingenuous
girl was soon to learn what modern news-gathering and dissemination
means in this great Republic.But she rode on, happy in the thought
that she and the Beaubien were formulating plans to save Mrs."We'll arrange it somehow," said the Beaubien, looking up from her
papers when Carmen entered."Go, dearie, and play the organ while I
finish this.Then I will return home with you to have a talk with Mrs.For hours the happy girl lingered at the beloved organ.The Beaubien
at her desk below stopped often to listen.And often she would hastily
brush away the tears, and plunge again into her papers."I suppose I
should have told Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," she said."But I couldn't give
her any hope.And yet," she reflected
sadly, "who would believe _me_?"The morning papers lay still unread
upon her table.Late in the afternoon the Beaubien with Carmen entered her car and
directed the chauffeur to drive to the Hawley-Crowles home.As they
entered a main thoroughfare they heard the newsboys excitedly crying
extras.Of a sudden a vague, unformed presentiment of impending evil came to
the girl.She half rose, and clutched the Beaubien's hand.Then there
flitted through her mind like a beam of light the words of the
psalmist: "A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee."She sank back against
the Beaubien's shoulder and closed her eyes.Presently the chauffeur turned and said something
through the speaking tube.cried the Beaubien, springing from the seat.A loud cry escaped her as she took the sheet and glanced at the
startling headlines.James Hawley-Crowles, financially ruined,
and hurled to disgrace from the pinnacle of social leadership by the
awful exposure of the parentage of her ward, had been found in her
bedroom, dead, with a revolver clasped in her cold hand.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The chill winds of another autumn swirled through the masonry-lined
canons of the metropolis and sighed among the stark trees of its
deserted parks.They caught up the tinted leaves that dropped from
quivering branches and tossed them high, as Fate wantons with human
hopes before she blows her icy breath upon them.They shrieked among
the naked spars of the _Cossack_, drifting with her restless master
far out upon the white-capped waves.They moaned in low-toned agony
among the marble pillars of the Crowles mausoleum, where lay in
pitying sleep the misguided woman whose gods of gold and tinsel had
betrayed her.On the outskirts of the Bronx, in a newly opened suburb, a slender
girl, with books and papers under her arm, walked slowly against the
sharp wind, holding her hat with her free hand, and talking rapidly to
a young man who accompanied her.Toward them came an old <DW64>,
leaning upon a cane.As he stepped humbly aside to make room, the girl
looked up.Then, without stopping, she slipped a few coins into his
coat pocket as she passed.The <DW64> stood in dumb amazement.He was poor--his clothes were thin
and worn--but he was not a beggar--he had asked nothing.The girl
turned and threw back a smile to him.Then of a sudden there came into
the old man's wrinkled, care-lined face such a look, such a
comprehension of that love which knows neither Jew nor Gentile, Greek
nor Barbarian, as would have caused even the Rabbis, at the cost of
defilement, to pause and seek its heavenly meaning.A few blocks farther on the strong wind sternly disputed the girl's
right to proceed, and she turned with a merry laugh to her companion.But as she stood, the wind fell, leaving a heap of dead leaves about
her feet.She stooped and
took up a two-dollar bill.Her companion threw her a wondering look; but the girl made no
comment.In silence they went on, until a few minutes more of brisk
walking brought them to a newly built, stucco-coated bungalow.Running
rapidly up the steps, the girl threw wide the door and called, "Mother
dear!"The Beaubien rose from her sewing to receive the hearty embrace.she said, devouring the sparkling creature with eager
eyes.Lewis begins his law course at once, and I may take
what I wish.Hitt's coming to call to-night and bring a
friend, a Mr.The Beaubien drew the girl to her and kissed her again and again.Then
she glanced over her shoulder at the man with a bantering twinkle in
her eyes and said, "Don't you wish you could do that?"Yes he can, too, mother," asserted the girl."I'm afraid it wouldn't look well," he said."And, besides, I don't dare lose my heart to her."With a final squeeze the girl tore herself from the Beaubien's
reluctant arms and hurried to the little kitchen."What is it
to-night, Jude?"she demanded, catching the domestic in a vigorous
embrace."Well, then, liver and bacon, with floating island," she whispered,
very mysteriously.Returning to the little parlor, Carmen encountered the fixed gaze of
both the Beaubien and Father Waite.she demanded, stopping and
looking from one to the other.said the Beaubien, in a tone of mock
severity."Oh," laughed the girl, running to the woman and seating herself in
the waiting lap, "he told, didn't he?Can't I ever trust you with a
secret?"in a tone of rebuke, turning to the man."Surely," he replied, laughing; "and I should not have divulged
this had I not seen in the incident something more than mere
chance--something meant for us all.""I--I think I have seen the working of a
stupendous mental law--am I not right?""You saw
a need, and met it, unsolicited.You found your own in another's
good."The girl smiled at the Beaubien without replying."What about it,
dearie?""She need not answer," said Father Waite, "for we know.She but cast
her bread upon the unfathomable ocean of love, and it returned to her,
wondrously enriched.""If you are going to talk about me, I shall not stay," declared
Carmen, rising.And she departed for the
kitchen, but not without leaving a smile for each of them as she went.The Beaubien and Father Waite remained some moments in silence."She is the light that is
guiding me.This little incident which you have just related is but a
manifestation of the law of love by which she lives.She gave,
unasked, and with no desire to be seen and advertised.There was no chance, no
miracle, no luck about it.It was--it
was--only the working of her beloved Christ-principle.if
we only knew--"

"We _shall_ know, Madam!""Her secret is
but the secret of Jesus himself, which was open to a world too dull to
comprehend.And," his eyes brightening, "to
that end I have been formulating a great plan.That's why I've asked
Hitt to come here to-night.Remember, my
dear friend, we are true searchers; and 'all things work together for
good to them that love God.'Our love of truth and real good is so
great that, like the consuming desire of the Jewish nation, it is
_bound_ to bring the Christ!"*       *       *       *       *

For three months the Beaubien and Carmen had dwelt together in this
lowly environment; and here they had found peace, the first that the
tired woman had known since childhood.The sudden culmination of those
mental forces which had ejected Carmen from society, crushed Ketchim
and a score of others, and brought the deluded Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to
a bitter end, had left the Beaubien with dulled sensibilities.Even
Ames himself had been shocked into momentary abandonment of his
relentless pursuit of humanity by the unanticipated _denouement_.But
when he had sufficiently digested the newspaper accounts wherein were
set forth in unsparing detail the base rumors of the girl's parentage
and of her removal from a brothel before her sudden elevation to
social heights, he rose in terrible wrath and prepared to hunt down to
the death the perpetrators of the foul calumny.Whence had come this
tale, which even the girl could not refute?He had
sailed for Europe--though but a day before.The man was
cringing like a craven murderer in his cell, for none dared give him
bail.Was it revenge for his own sharp move in regard to
La Libertad?He would have given all he possessed to lay his heavy
hands upon the guilty ones!The editors of the great newspapers,
perhaps?Ames raged like a wounded lion in the office of every editor
in the city.But they were perfectly safe, for the girl, although she
told a straightforward story, could not say positively that the
published statements concerning her were false.Yet, though few knew
it, there were two city editors and several reporters who, in the days
immediately following, found it convenient to resign their positions
and leave the city before the awful wrath of the powerful man.And, after weeks of terror, that
browbeaten woman, her hair whitening under the terrible persecution of
her relentless master, fled secretly, with her terrified daughter, to
England, whither the stupified Duke of Altern and his scandalized
mother had betaken themselves immediately following the expose.Thereupon Ames's lawyer drew up a bill of divorce, alleging desertion,
and laid it before the judge who fed from his master's hand.Meantime, the devouring wrath of Ames swept like a prairie fire over the
dry, withering stalks of the smart set.He vowed he would take Carmen
and flaunt her in the faces of the miserable character-assassins who
had sought her ruin!He swore he would support her with his untold
millions and force society to acknowledge her its queen!He had it
in his power to wreck the husband of every arrogant, supercilious
dame in the entire clique!He commenced at once with the unfortunate
Gannette.The latter, already tottering, soon fell before the subtle
machinations of Hodson and his able cohorts.Then, as a telling example
to the rest, Ames pursued him to the doors of the Lunacy Commission,
and rested not until that body had condemned his victim to a living
death in a state asylum.Kane, Fitch, and Weston fled to cover, and
concentrated their guns upon their common enemy.The Beaubien alone
stood out against him for three months.Her existence was death in
life; but from the hour that she first read the newspaper intelligence
regarding Carmen and the unfortunate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, she hid the
girl so completely that Ames was effectually balked in his attempts at
drastic vindication in her behalf.But this served only to intensify his anger, and he thereupon turned
its full force upon the lone woman.Driven to desperation, she stood
at length at bay and hurled at him her remaining weapon.Again the
social set was rent, and this time by the report that the black cloud
of bigamy hung over Ames.It was a fat season for the newspapers, and
they made the most of it.As a result, several of them found
themselves with libel suits on their hands.The Beaubien herself was
confronted with a suit for defamation of character, and was obliged to
testify before the judge whom Ames owned outright that she had but the
latter's word for the charge, and that, years since, in a moment of
maudlin sentimentalism, he had confessed to her that, as far as he
knew, the wife of his youth was still living.Ames then took his heavy toll, and retired within himself to sulk
and plan future assaults and reprisals.The Beaubien, crushed, broken, sick at heart, gathered up the scant
remains of her once large fortune, disposed of her effects, and
withdrew to the outskirts of the city.She would have left the
country, but for the fact that the tangled state of her finances
necessitated her constant presence in New York while her lawyers
strove to bring order out of chaos and placate her raging persecutor.To flee meant complete abandonment of her every financial resource to
Ames.And so, with the assistance of Father Waite and Elizabeth Wall,
who placed themselves at once under her command, she took a little
house, far from the scenes of her troubles, and quietly removed
thither with Carmen.One day shortly thereafter a woman knocked timidly at her door.Carmen
saw the caller and fled into her arms.The woman had come to return the string of pearls which the girl had
thrust into her hands on the night of the Charity Ball.She had not been able to bring herself to sell them.She
had wanted--oh, she knew not what, excepting that she wanted to see
again the girl whose image had haunted her since that eventful night
when the strange child had wandered into her abandoned life.Yes, she
would have given her testimony as to Carmen; but who would have
believed her, a prostitute?And--but the radiant girl gathered her in
her arms and would not let her go without a promise to return.And each time there was a change in
her.The Beaubien always forced upon her a little money and a promise
to come back.It developed that Jude was cooking in a cheap down-town
restaurant."Why not for us, mother, if she will?"And, though the sin-stained woman demurred and protested her
unworthiness, yet the love that knew no evil drew her irresistibly,
and she yielded at length, with her heart bursting.Then, in her great joy, Carmen's glad cry echoed through the little
house: "Oh, mother dear, we're free, we're free!"But the Beaubien was not free.Night after night her sleepless pillow
was wet with bitter tears of remorse, when the accusing angel stood
before her and relentlessly revealed each act of shameful meanness, of
cruel selfishness, of sordid immorality in her wasted life.And,
lastly, the weight of her awful guilt in bringing about the
destruction of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles lay upon her soul like a mountain.Oh, if she had only foreseen even a little of it!Oh, that Carmen had
come to her before--or not at all!And yet she could not wish that she
had never known the girl.The day of judgment was bound
to come.And, but for the comforting presence of
that sweet child, she had long since become a raving maniac.It was
Carmen who, in those first long nights of gnawing, corroding remorse,
wound her soft arms about the Beaubien's neck, as she lay tossing in
mental agony on her bed, and whispered the assurances of that infinite
Love which said, "Behold, I make all things new!"It was Carmen who
whispered to her of the everlasting arms beneath, and of the mercy
reflected by him who, though on the cross, forgave mankind because of
their pitiable ignorance.It is ignorance, always ignorance of what
constitutes real good, that makes men seek it through wrong channels.The Beaubien had sought good--all the world does--but she had never
known that God alone is good, and that men cannot find it until they
reflect Him.And so she had "missed the mark."Oh, sinful, mesmerized
world, ye shall find Me--the true good--only when ye seek Me with all
your heart!And yet, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins."Only a God who is love could voice such a promise!And Carmen knew;
and she hourly poured her great understanding of love into the empty
heart of the stricken Beaubien.Then at last came days of quiet, and planning for the future.The
Beaubien would live--yes, but not for herself.Nay, that life had gone
out forever, nor would mention of it pass her lips again.The
Colombian revolution--her mendacious connivances with Ames--her
sinful, impenitent life of gilded vice--aye, the door was now closed
against that, absolutely and forever more.She had passed through the
throes of a new birth; she had risen again from the bed of anguish;
but she rose stripped of her worldly strength.Carmen was now the
staff upon which she leaned.And Carmen--what had been her thought when foul calumny laid its sooty
touch upon her?What had been the working of her mind when that world
which she had sought to illumine with the light of her own purity had
cast her out?When the blow fell the portals of her mind closed at once against
every accusing thought, against every insidious suggestion of defeat,
of loss, of dishonor.The arrows of malice, as well as those of
self-pity and condemnation, snapped and fell, one by one, as they
hurtled vainly against the whole armor of God wherewith the girl stood
clad.Self sank into service; and she gathered the bewildered,
suffering Beaubien into her arms as if she had been a child.She would
have gone to Ames, too, had she been permitted--not to plead for
mercy, but to offer the tender consolation and support which, despite
the havoc he was committing, she knew he needed even more than the
Beaubien herself."Paul had been a murderer," she often said, as she sat in the darkness
alone with the suffering woman and held her trembling hand."But he
became the chief of apostles.When the light came, he
shut the door against the past.If he hadn't, dearest, he never could
have done what he did.Ames, will have to do the
same."And this the Beaubien could do, and did, after months of
soul-racking struggle.But Ames sat in spiritual darkness, whipped by
the foul brood of lust and revenge, knowing not that the mountainous
wrath which he hourly heaped higher would some day fall, and bury him
fathoms deep.Throughout the crisis Father Waite had stood by them stanchly."I've just longed for some reasonable
excuse to become a social outcast," the latter had said, as she was
helping Carmen one day to pack her effects prior to removing from the
Hawley-Crowles mansion."I long for a hearthstone to which I can
attach myself--"

"Then attach yourself to ours!""For I know that now you are really
going to live--and I want to live as you will.Moreover--" She paused
and smiled queerly at the girl--"I am quite in love with your hero,
Father Waite, you know."Harris, too, made a brief call before departing again for Denver."I've got to hustle for a living now," he explained, "and it's me for
the mountains once more!New York is no place for such a tender lamb
as I. Oh, I've been well trimmed--but I know enough now to keep away
from this burg!"While he was yet speaking there came a loud ring at the front door of
the little bungalow, followed immediately by the entrance of the
manager of a down-town vaudeville house.He plunged at once into his
errand.He would offer Carmen one hundred dollars a week, and a
contract for six months, to appear twice daily in his theater.but she did put it over
the society ginks."And the Beaubien, shivering at the awful
proposal, was glad Harris was there to lead the zealous theatrical man
firmly to the door.Lastly, came one Amos A. Hitt, gratuitously, to introduce himself as
one who knew Cartagena and was likely to return there in the not
distant future, where he would be glad to do what he might to remove
the stain which had been laid upon the name of the fair girl.The
genuineness of the man stood out so prominently that the Beaubien took
him at once into her house, where he was made acquainted with Carmen."Oh," cried the girl, "Cartagena!Why, I wonder--do you know Padre
Jose de Rincon?""A priest who once taught there in the University, many years ago?And
who was sent up the river, to Simiti?Then Carmen fell upon his neck; and there in that moment was begun a
friendship that grew daily stronger, and in time bore richest fruit.It soon became known that Hitt was giving a course of lectures that
fall in the University, covering the results of his archaeological
explorations; so Carmen and Father Waite went often to hear him.And
the long breaths of University atmosphere which the girl inhaled
stimulated a desire for more.Besides, Father Waite had some time
before announced his determination to study there that winter, as long
as his meager funds would permit."I shall take up law," he had one day said."It will open to me the
door of the political arena, where there is such great need of real
men, men who stand for human progress, patriotism, and morality.I
shall seek office--not for itself, but for the good I can do, and the
help I can be in a practical way to my fellow-men.Carmen shared the inspiration; and so she, too, with the Beaubien's
permission, applied for admittance to the great halls of learning, and
was accepted.*       *       *       *       *

"And now," began Father Waite that evening, when Hitt and his friend
had come, and, to the glad surprise of Carmen, Elizabeth Wall had
driven up in her car to take the girl for a ride, but had yielded to
the urgent invitation to join the little conference, "my plan, in
which I invite you to join, is, briefly, _to study this girl_!"Carmen's eyes opened wide, and her face portrayed blank amazement, as
Father Waite stood pointing gravely to her.Nor were the others less
astonished--all but the Beaubien."Let me explain," Father Waite continued."We are assembled here
to-night as representatives, now or formerly, of very diversified
lines of human thought.I have stood as the
embodiment of Christly claims, as the active agent of one of the
mightiest of human institutions, the ancient Christian Church.For
years I have studied its accepted authorities and its all-inclusive
assumptions, which embrace heaven, earth, and hell.For years I sought
with sincere consecration to apply its precepts to the dire needs of
humanity.I have traced its origin in the dim twilight of the
Christian era and its progress down through the centuries, through
heavy vicissitudes to absolute supremacy, on down through schisms and
subsequent decline, to the present hour, when the great system seems
to be gathering its forces for a life and death stand in this, the New
World.I have known and associated with its dignitaries and its humble
priests.I know the policies and motives underlying its quiet
movements.And so I
withdrew from it my allegiance."Carmen's thought, as she listened, was busy with another whose
experience had not been dissimilar, but about whom the human coils had
been too tightly wound to be so easily broken.Hitt," Father Waite went on, "represented
the great protest against the abuses and corruption which permeated
the system for which I stood.He, like myself, embodied the eternal
warfare of the true believer against the heretic.Yet, without my
churchly system, I was taught to believe, he and those who share his
thought are damned.we both claimed the same
divine Father, and accepted the Christly definition of Him as Love.We
were two brothers of the same great family, yet calling each other
_anathema_!""And to-day," he continued, "we
brothers are humbly meeting on the common ground of failure--failure
to understand the Christ, and to meet the needs of our fellow-men with
our elaborate systems of theology.""I heard another priest, years ago, make a similar confession," said
Hitt reflectively."I would he were here to-night!""He is here, in spirit," replied Father Waite; "for the same spirit of
eager inquiry and humble desire for truth that animates us no doubt
moved him.I have reason to think so," he added, looking at Carmen."For this girl's spiritual development I believe to be very largely
his work."He knew but little as yet of her
past association with the priest Jose.Hitt, represented the greatest systems of so-called
Christian belief," pursued Father Waite."Madam Beaubien, on the other
hand, has represented the world that waits, as yet vainly, for
redemption.We have not been able to afford it her.Yet--pardon my
frankness in thus referring to you, Madam.It is only to benefit us
all--that the means of redemption _have_ been brought to her, we must
now admit."She started to speak, but Father
Waite raised a detaining hand."Miss Wall
represents the weariness of spirit and unrest abroad in the world
to-day, the spirit that finds life not worth the while; and Mr.Haynerd voices the cynical disbelief, the agnosticism, of that great
class who can not accept the childish tenets of our dogmatic systems
of theology, yet who have nothing but the philosophy of stoicism or
epicureanism to offer in substitute.""You have me correctly classified," he said."I'm a Yankee, and from Missouri.""And now, having placed us," said the Beaubien, "how will you classify
Carmen?"Father Waite looked at the girl reverently."Hers is the leaven," he
replied gently, "which has leavened the whole lump."My good friends," he went on earnestly, "like all priests and
preachers, I have been but a helpless spectator of humanity's
troubles.I have longed and prayed to know how to do the works which
Jesus is said to have done; yet, at the sick-bed or the couch of
death, what could I do--I, to whom the apostolic virtue is supposed to
have descended in the long line of succession?I could give promises of
remitted sins--though I knew I spoke not truth.I could comfort by
voicing the insipid views of our orthodox heaven.And yet I know that
what I gave was but mental nostrums, narcotics, to stupify until death
might end the suffering."And if you were a good orthodox priest," interposed Haynerd, "you
would refuse burial to dissenters, and bar from your communion table
all who were not of your faith, eh?""I would have to, were I consistent; for Catholicism is
the only true faith, founded upon the revealed word of God, you know."He smiled pathetically as he looked around at the little group."Now," he continued, "you, Mr.Haynerd, are a man of the world.You
are not in sympathy with the Church.You are an infidel, an
unbeliever.And therefore are you '_anathema_,' you know.""But you can not deny that at times you think very
seriously.And, I may go farther: you long, intensely, for something
that the world does not offer.Now, what is it but truth that you are
seeking?""I want to know," answered Haynerd quickly.I
am fond of exhibitions of sleight-of-hand and jugglery.But the
priestly thaumaturgy that claims to transform a biscuit into the
flesh of a man dead some two thousand years, and a bit of grape juice
into his blood, irritates me inexpressibly!And so does the
jugglery by which your Protestant fellows, Hitt, attempt to reconcile
their opposite beliefs.Why, what difference can it possibly make
to the Almighty whether we miserable little beings down here are
baptised with water, milk, or kerosene, or whether we are immersed,
sprinkled, or well soused?for nearly twenty centuries
you have been wandering among the non-essentials.Isn't it time to get
down to business, and instead of burning at the stake every one who
differs with you, try conscientiously to put into practice a few of
the simple moral precepts, such as the Golden Rule, and loving
one's neighbor as one's self?""There," commented Father Waite, "you have a bit of the world's
opinion of the Church!Can we say that the censure is not just?Would
not Christ himself to-day speak even more scathingly to those who
advocate a system of belief that puts blinders on men's minds, and
then leads them into the pit of ignorance and superstition?""Ye have taken away the key of knowledge," murmured Carmen; "ye
entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye
hindered."exclaimed Haynerd, looking at the girl who stood as a
living protest against all that hampers the expansion of the human
mind; that quenches its note of joy, and dulls its enlarging and ever
nobler concept of God."Now I want to know, first, if there is a God;
and, if so, what He is, and what His relation is to me.I want to know
what I am, and why I am here, and what future I may look forward to,
if any.I don't care two raps about a God who can't help me here on
earth, who can't set me right and make me happy--cure my ills, meet my
needs, and supply a few of the luxuries as well.And if there is a
God, and we can meet Him only by dying, then why in the name of common
sense all this hullabaloo about death?Why, in that case, death is the
grandest thing in life!But
you preacher fellows fight death tooth and nail.You're scared stiff
when you contemplate it.You make Christianity just a grand
preparation for death.Yet it isn't the gateway to life to you, and
you know it!Then why, if you are honest, do you tell such rubbish to
your trusting followers?""I would remind you," returned Hitt with a little laugh, "that I
don't, now.""Well, friends," interposed Father Waite, "it is to take up for
earnest consideration just such questions as Mr.Haynerd propounds,
that I have my suggestion to make, namely, that we meet together once
or twice a week, or as often as we may agree upon, to search for--"
his voice dropped to a whisper--"to search for God, and with this
young girl as our guide.For I believe she is very close to Him.The
world knows God only by hearsay.Carmen has _proved_ Him."Men ask why it is," he went on, "that God remains hidden from them;
why they can not understand Him.They forget that Jesus revealed God
as Love.And, if that is so, in order to know Him all mankind must
love their fellow-men.But they go right on hating one another,
cheating, abusing, robbing, slaying, persecuting, and still wondering
why they don't know God, regardless of the only possible way of ever
working out from the evils by which they are beset, if we believe that
Jesus told the truth, or was correctly reported."He paused and
reflected for a moment.Then:

"The ancient prophet said: 'Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye
shall search for me with all your hearts.'It is my proposal that we
bind ourselves together in such a search.To it we can bring diverse
talents.To our vast combined worldly experience, I bring knowledge of
the ancient Greek and Latin Fathers, together with Church history.Hitt brings his command of the Hebrew language and history, and an
intimate acquaintance with the ancient manuscripts, and Biblical
interpretation, together with a wide knowledge of the physical
sciences.Madam Beaubien, Miss Wall, and Mr.Haynerd contribute their
earnest, searching, inquisitive spirit, and a knowledge of the world's
needs.Moreover, we all come together without bias or prejudice.And
Carmen--she contributes that in which we have all been so woefully
lacking, and without which we can _never_ know God, the rarest,
deepest spirituality.Shall we
undertake the search, my friends?It means a study of her thought, and
the basis upon which it rests."The Beaubien raised her hand to her moist eyes.She was thinking of
that worldly coterie which formerly was wont to meet nightly in her
magnificent mansion to prey upon their fellows.Oh, how different the
spirit of this little gathering!"You will meet here, with me," she said in a broken voice.There were none there unacquainted with the sorrows of this penitent,
broken woman.Each rose in turn and clasped her hand.Carmen threw
her arms about her neck and kissed her repeatedly."You see," said the Beaubien, smiling up through her tears, "what this
child's religion is?Would the swinging of incense burners and the
mumbling of priestly formulae enhance it?""Jesus said, 'Having seen me ye have seen God,'" said Father Waite."And I say," replied the Beaubien, "that having seen this child, you
have indeed seen Him."CHAPTER 2


"I'm afraid," Haynerd was saying, as he and Father Waite were wending
their way to the Beaubien home a few evenings later, "that this Carmen
is the kind of girl you read about in sentimental novels; the kind who
are always just ready to step into heaven, but who count for little in
the warfare and struggle of actual mundane existence.She
isn't quite true to life, you know, as a book critic would say of an
impossible heroine.""You mistake, my friend," replied Father Waite warmly."She is the
very kind we would see oftener, were it not for the belief that years
bring wisdom, and so, as a consequence, the little child is crushed
beneath a load of false beliefs and human laws that make it reflect
its mortal parents, rather than its heavenly one.""But I'd like to see her under stress--"

"Under stress!You haven't the slightest conception
of the stress she's been under most of her life!But your criticism
unconsciously pays her the highest tribute, for her kind never show by
word, deed, or look what they are enduring.That frail-appearing girl
has stood up under loads that would have flattened you and me out like
gold leaf!"She's so far and away ahead
of mortals like you and me that she doesn't admit the reality and
power of evil--and, believe me, she's got her reasons for not
admitting it, too!Only try humbly to
attain a little of her understanding and faith; and try to avoid
making yourself ridiculous by criticising what you do not comprehend.That, indeed, has been mankind's age-long blunder--and they have
thereby made asses of themselves!"Edward Haynerd, or "Ned," as he was invariably known, prided himself
on being something of a philosopher.And in the name of philosophy he
chose to be quixotic.That one who hated the dissimulations and shams
of our class aristocracy so cordially should have earned his
livelihood--and a good one, too--as publisher of the Social Era, a
sprightly weekly chronicle of happenings in fashionable society, would
have appeared anomalous in any but a man gifted in the Greek
sophistries and their modern innumerable and arid offshoots.Haynerd
was a laughing Democritus, an easy-going, even-tempered fellow, doomed
to be loved, and by the same graces thoroughly cheated by the world in
general.He had in his rapid career of some thirty-five years dipped
deeply into things mundane, and had come to the surface, sputtering
and blowing, with his face well smeared with mud from the shallow
depths.Whereupon he remarked that such an existence was a poor way of
serving the Lord, and turned cynic.It
was likewise his capital and stock-in-trade.By it he won a place for
himself in the newspaper world, and later, as a credit asset, had
employed it successfully in negotiating for the Social Era.It taking
over the publication of this sheet he had remarked that life was
altogether too short to permit of attempting anything worth while; and
so he forthwith made no further assaults upon fame--assuming that he
had ever done so--but settled comfortably down to the enjoyment of his
sinecure.And as justification for his
self-imposed celibacy he pompously quoted Kant: "I am a bachelor, and
I could not cease to be a bachelor without a disturbance that would be
intolerable to me."He simply shirked
responsibility and ease-threatening risk."You see," he remarked, explaining himself later to Carmen, "I'm a
pseudo-litterateur--I conduct a 'Who's It?'for the quidnunces of this
blase old burg.And I really meet a need by furnishing an easy method
of suicide, for my little vanity sheet is a sort of social mirror,
that all who look therein may die of laughter.By the way, I had to
run those base squibs about you; but, by George!I'm going to make a
retraction in next Saturday's issue.I'll put a crimp in friend Ames
that'll make him squeal.I'll say he has ten wives, and eight of 'em
Zulus, at that!""We have enough to meet, without
going out of our way to stir up more.Let it all work out now, as it
will, in the right way."Say, don't you
think that in formulating a new religion you're carrying coals to
Newcastle?Seems to me we've got enough now, if we'd practice 'em."Haynerd, is only the practice of the teachings of a
Nazarene Jew, named Jesus," she replied gently."Well, my religion is Socialism, I guess," he said lightly.So we
meet on common ground, don't we?"She held out her hand, and he took
it, a puzzled expression coming into his face."Well," he said, glancing about, "we'll have to dispute that later.I
see Father Waite is about to open this little religious seminar.But
we'll get back to the discussion of myself," he added, his eyes
twinkling."For, like Thoreau, I prefer to discuss that subject,
because there's no other about which I know so much.""Nor so little," she added, laughing and squeezing his hand as she
turned from him.The little coterie took their places around the dining room table,
which was well strewn with books of reference and writing materials.A deep, reverent silence fell
upon the group."Friends," began Father Waite slowly, "we are inaugurating to-night a
mission of the most profound significance.No question so vitally
touches the human race as the one which we shall reverently discuss in
this and subsequent meetings.I thought as I came in here to-night of
the wisdom of Epictitus, who said, 'What do I want?To acquaint myself
with the true order of things and comply with it.'I am sure no
statement so fully expresses our common desire as that.""If Adam was a Baptist, I want to know
and comply with the fact."Then Father Waite held up a hand and again
became serious."Can we treat lightly even the Adam story, when we consider how much
misery and rancor its literal acceptance has caused among mankind?Out of deepest sympathy for a world in search of truth, let us pity
their stumblings, and take heed that we fall not ourselves."Carmen's hand stole toward the
Beaubien's and clasped it tightly."In these days, as of old, it is still said, 'There is no God!'And
yet, though the ignorant and wilful admit it not, mankind's very
existence is a function of their concept of a Creator, a sole
cause of all that is.No question, economic, social, political, or
other, is so vitally related to humanity as this: 'Is there a God?'And the corollary: 'What is His relation to me?'For there can be
nothing so important as a knowledge of truth.Can the existence
of a God be demonstrated?Can He be shown to be beneficent, in
view of the world's testimony?If the
Bible, then can its authenticity be established?The greatest of
our so-called civilizations are known as Christian.But who can say
by them what Christianity really is?""I am quite prepared to say what it is not!""Doubtless," resumed Father Waite.But at present
we are seeking constructive criticism, not solely destructive.There
has been quite enough of that sort in the world.But, to go a step
further, can we say positively that the truth is to be found even in
Christianity?""Please explain your question," said Miss Wall, with a puzzled look."The first essential is always facts," he continued."The deduction of
right conclusions will follow--provided, as Matthew Arnold so tersely
said, we have sufficient delicacy of perception, subtlety, wisdom, and
tact.And, I may add, sufficient freedom from prejudice and mental
bias--ah, there is the stumbling block!""Matthew Arnold," ventured Haynerd, "was dubbed a first-class infidel,
as I recall it."As have been many of the world's most earnest searchers.Yet he enunciated much truth, which we to-day are acknowledging.But,
to resume, since Christianity as we know it is based upon the
personality of a man, Jesus, we ask: Can the historicity of Jesus be
established?"queried Miss Wall in greater
surprise than before.And if so, is he correctly reported in what we call the Gospels?Then, did he reveal the truth to his followers?And, lastly, has that
truth been correctly transmitted to us?""And," added Hitt, "there is still the question: Assuming that he gave
us the truth, can we apply it successfully to the meeting of our daily
needs?""The point is well taken," replied Father Waite."For, though I may
know that there are very abstruse mathematical principles, yet I may
be utterly unable to demonstrate or use them.But now," he went on,
"we are brought to other vital questions concerning us.They are, I
think, points to which the theologian has given but scant thought.If
we conclude that there is a God, we are confronted with the material
universe and man.And what are their natures and
import?""Seems to me you've cut out a large
assignment for this little party.Those are questions that the world
has played football with for thousands of years.Do you think we can
settle them in a few evenings' study?We can't spare you," laughed Father Waite.Then he glanced at
Carmen, who had sat quiet, apparently unhearing, during the remarks."I think you will hear things soon that will set you thinking," he
said."But now we are going to let our traveled friend, Mr.Hitt,
give us just a word in summation of his thought regarding the
modern world and its attitude toward the questions which we have been
propounding."The explorer leaned back in his chair and assumed his customary
attitude when in deep thought.All eyes turned upon him in eager
expectation."The world," he began reflectively, "presents to me to-day the most
interesting aspect it has assumed since history began.True, the age
is one of great mental confusion.Quite as true, startling discoveries
and astounding inventions have so upset our staid old mediaeval views
that the world is hurriedly crowding them out, together with its God.Doctrines for which our fathers bled and burned are to-day lightly
tossed upon the ash heap.The searchlight is turned never so
mercilessly upon the founder of the Christian religion, and upon the
manuscripts which relate his words and deeds.Yet most of us have
grown so busy--I often wonder with what--that we have no time for that
which can not be grasped as we run.We work desperately by day,
building up the grandest material fabric the world has ever seen; and
at night we repair the machine for the next day's run.Even our
college professors bewail the lack of time for solid reading and
research.And if our young pursue studies, it is with the almost
exclusive thought of education as a means of earning a material
livelihood later, and, if possible, rearing a mansion and stocking its
larder and garage.It is, I repeat, a grandly materialistic age,
wherein, to the casual observer, spirituality is at a very low ebb."He thrust his long legs under the table and cast his eyes upward to
the ceiling as he resumed:

"The modern world is still in its spiritual infancy, and does not
often speak the name of God.Not that we are so much irreverent as
that we feel no special need of Him in our daily pursuits.Since we
ceased to tremble at the thunders of Sinai, and their lingering echoes
in bulls and heresy condemnations, we find that we get along just as
well--indeed, much better.And it really is quite bad form now to
speak continually of God, or to refer to Him as anything real and
vital.To be on such terms of intimacy with Him as this girl Carmen
is--in thought, at least--would be regarded to-day as evidence of
sentimentalism and weakness."He paused again, to marshal his thought and give his auditors an
opportunity for comment.Then, as the silence remained unbroken, he
continued:

"Viewing the world from one standpoint, it has achieved remarkable
success in applying the knout to superstition and limitation.But,
like a too energetic housekeeper, it has swept out much that is
essential with the _debris_.When spirituality ceases to be real or
vital to a people, then a grave danger threatens them.Materiality has
never proved a blessing, as history shows.Life that is made up of
strain and ceaseless worry is not life.The incessant accumulation of
material wealth, when we do not know how really to enjoy it, is folly.To pamper the flesh, to the complete ignoring of the spirit, is
suicide.The increased hankering after physical excitements and animal
pleasures, to the utter abandonment of the search for that which is
real and satisfying, is an exhibition of gross, mesmeric stupidity, to
say the least.It shows that our sense of life is awry.""But the world is surely attempting its own betterment," protested
Haynerd."I grant you that," replied Hitt."But legislation and coercion are
the wrong means to employ."Oh, well, you are not going to change the race until the individual
himself changes.""Quite the contrary, that is the
pith of my observations.And no sane
man will maintain that general reform can ever come until the
individual's needs are met--his daily, hourly, worldly needs.""I think I get your point," said Father Waite."It is wholly a
question of man's concept of the cause of things, himself included,
and their purpose and end, is it not?""The restless spirit of the modern world is
hourly voicing its discontent with a faltering faith which has no
other basis than blind belief.It wants demonstrable fact upon which
to build.In plain words, _mankind would be better if they but knew
how_!""Well, we show them how," asserted Haynerd."But they don't do as we
tell 'em.""Are you quite sure that you show them how?""What do you
ever do toward showing them how permanently to eradicate a single
human difficulty?""Oh, well, putting it that way, nothing, of course."And so
the world continues to wait for surcease from woe in a life beyond the
grave.But now, returning to our survey, let me say that amid all the
folly of vain pursuits, of wars and strife, of doleful living and
pitiable dying, there are more encouraging and hopeful signs hung out
to the inquiring thought to-day than ever before in history.If I
misread not, we are already entered upon changes so tremendous that
their end must be the revolutionizing of thought and conduct, and
hence of life.Our present age is one of great extremes: though we
touch the depths, we are aiming likewise at the heights.I doubt if
there ever was a time when so many sensed the nothingness of the
pleasures of the flesh.I doubt if ever there was such a quickening of
the business conscience, and such a determined desire to introduce
honesty and purity into our dealings with one another.Never was the
need of religion more keenly felt by the world than it is to-day; and
that is why mankind are willing to accept any religious belief,
however eccentric, that comes in the guise of truth and bearing the
promise of surcease from sin, sickness, and sorrow here this side of
the grave.The world was never so hungry for religious truth; and this
fact is a perpetual challenge to the Church.There is a tremendous
world-yearning to know and to do better.I
answer, a growing appreciation of the idea that 'the kingdom of
harmony is within you.'""Jesus said that," murmured Carmen, looking up."He but amplified and gave form to the great fact that there was
an influence for better things always existent in the ancient Jews,
that'something not ourselves,' if you will, 'that makes for
righteousness.'And he showed that that influence could be outwardly
externalized in freedom from the ills which beset humanity.""Very good," put in Haynerd."That'something not ourselves' is the germ of the true idea of God,"
answered Hitt."The terms are synonymous," said Hitt."And now let me conclude with a
final observation.Mankind's beliefs are in a whirl.Orthodoxy and conservatism are hanging desperately to the
world's flying skirts, but they will eventually drop off.No change in
thought has been greater than that concerning God.The absentee Lord
who started the universe and then withdrew has gone to the scrap heap,
with the ridiculous views of predestination and infant damnation.The
idea of a God who at divers times interfered with His creation and
temporarily set aside His own laws to convince puny man of His
greatness, is likewise obsolescent.The world is slowly growing into a
conception of a creator, of some kind, but at least mental, and
universally present.Nay, more, available for all our problems and
needs.And the end will be the adoption of that conception, enlarged
and purified still further, and taken into the minutest affairs of our
daily life--as this girl has done.The day of patient suffering in
this world, under the spell of a promise of compensating reward in the
heavenly future, has all but passed.We are gradually becoming
conscious of the stupendous fact that the kingdom of all harmony,
immortality, and good, is _right here within us_--and therefore can be
naught but a consciousness of absolute good, perfectly attainable by
humanity as the 'old man' of Paul is laid off, but not gained,
necessarily, through what we call death."The silence which followed was broken at length by Miss Wall."And
what constitutes the 'old man'?""Largely, I think," said Hitt, "the belief that matter is real."exclaimed Haynerd, almost rising from his chair."I stand on my statement," he replied.Father Waite rose slowly, as if lost in thought."History shows," he
said, meditatively, "that man's progress has been proportionate to his
freedom from the limitation of ignorance and undemonstrable belief.And that freedom has come as man's concept of God has grown less and
less material, and more and more spiritual.From the animal nature of
the savage, to whom all is matter, down--or up--to the man of to-day,
to whom mind is assuming ever greater ascendency, man's progress has
been marked by a throwing off of limiting beliefs, theological or
other, in material power and substance.The development of the least
material forces, steam, electricity, the X-ray, has come only as the
human mind has thrown off a portion of its hampering material beliefs.I am astounded when I think of it, and of its marvelous message to
future generations!For, from the premise that the creator of all
things is spirit, or mind, as you will, comes the corollary that the
creation itself must of necessity be _mental_.And from this come such
deductions as fairly make me tremble.Carmen has told me of the
deductions which her tutor, the priest Jose, drew from the single
premise that the universe is infinite in extent--a premise which I
think we all will accept.""There can be no question about it," said Hitt, nodding his head."Well," continued Father Waite, "that granted, we must likewise grant
its creator to be infinite, must we not?""And that puts the creator out of the matter-class entirely.The
creator must be--"

"Mind," said Carmen, supplying the thought ever-present with her."I see no other conclusion," said Father Waite."But, that granted, a
flood of deductions pours in that sends human beliefs and reasoning
helter-skelter.For an infinite mind would eventually disintegrate if
it were not perfect in every part.""Perhaps it is already disintegrating, and that's what causes the evil
in the world," hazarded Haynerd."Utterly untenable, my friend," put in Hitt."For, granted an infinite
mind, we must grant the concomitant fact that such a mind is of very
necessity omnipotent, as well as perfect.What, then, could ever cause
disintegration in it?""You are right," resumed Father Waite."And such a mind, of very
necessity perfect, omnipotent, and, of course, ever-present, must
likewise be eternal.For there would be nothing to contest its
existence.Age, decay, and death would be unknown to it."And that," said Carmen, rising, "is my God."Father Waite nodded significantly to the others, and sat down, leaving
the girl facing them, her luminous eyes looking off into unfathomed
distances, and her face aglow with spiritual light."My God is infinite Good, to whom evil is unknown," she said."And
good includes all that is real.It includes wisdom, intelligence,
truth, life, and love--none of them material.Oh, not
by human reasoning, whereby you seek to establish the fact of His
existence, but by proof, daily proof, and in the hours when the floods
of suppositional evil have swept over me.You would rest your faith on
your deductions.But, as Saint Gregory said, no merit lies in faith
where human reason supplies the proof; and that you will all some day
know.And He ceaselessly expresses Himself in and
through His ideas, which He is constantly revealing.And these ideas express that goodness and
infinitude, from the tiniest up to the idea of God himself.And that
grandest idea is--man.Oh, no, not the men and women you think you see
about you in your daily walk.But the man that Jesus always saw back of every human concept.That
man is God's own idea of Himself.That is the man we shall all put on when we have
obeyed Paul and put off the old man, its counterfeit.""Then, Carmen," said Father Waite, "you believe all things to be
mental?""Yes, everything--man himself--and matter.""But, if God is mind, and infinite, He must include all things.Hence
He must include this imperfect representation, called the physical
man."Did not Jesus speak often of
the one lie about his Father, God?The material man and the material
universe are but parts of that lie.And a lie is always a supposition;
not real.All evil is contained in that supposition--a supposition
that there is power and life and substance apart from God.""A supposition is not made," replied Carmen quietly."I don't quite get that," interposed Miss Wall, her brows knitting.Carmen smiled down at the inquiring woman."The
creator of all things is mind.But you would have that
mind the creator of evil, also.Yet, your own reasoning has shown
that, on the premise of mind as infinite, such mind must be forever
whole, harmonious, perfect.The thoughts and ideas by which that mind
expresses itself must be likewise pure and perfect.Then that creative
mind can not create evil.For, a mind that creates evil must itself be
evil.And, being infinite, such a mind must include the evil it
creates.We would have, then, either a mind wholly evil, or one of
mixed evil and good.In either case, that mind must then destroy
itself."Your reasoning is, certainly," admitted Miss Wall."But, how to
account for evil, when God is infinite good--"

"To account for it at all," replied Carmen, "would be to make it
something real.Jesus would account for it only by classing it as a
lie about God.Now God, as the creative mind, must likewise be truth,
since He is perfection and harmony.Very well, a lie is always the
opposite of truth."Yes," said Father Waite, nodding his head as certain bright memories
returned to him."That is what you told me that day when I first
talked with you."Is it strange that God should have a suppositional opposite?""Has not everything with which you are concerned a
suppositional opposite?His suppositional opposite is
the great lie of evil.And matter is just as
mental as the thoughts which you are now holding.And so, evil and the lie are unreal.""The distinction seems to me theoretical," protested Miss Wall."That word'real,'" he said, "is perhaps
what is causing your confusion.The real is that which, according to
Spencer, does not pass away.We used to believe matter indestructible,
forever permanent.We learn that our views regarding it were very
incorrect."And yet," said Father Waite, "in this universe of constant change,
_something_ endures.What is it but the mind that is God, expressing
itself in such immaterial and permanent things as law, love, life,
power?""But now we have been brought back again to
the question of matter.If we can prove that matter is mental, and not
real substance, we will have established Carmen's premise that
everything is mental.Then there remains but the distinction between
the mind that is God, and its suppositional opposite, as expressed in
human existence.Let us conclude, therefore, that to-night we have
established, at least as a working hypothesis, that, since a thing
existing implies a creator; and since the existent universe, being
infinite, demands an infinite creator; and since a creator can not be
infinite without being at once mind, perfect, eternal, omnipotent,
omniactive, and good, we are fully justified in assuming that the
creator of all things still exists, and is infinite, ever-present
mind.Further than that we are not prepared to go, until we have
discussed the questions of matter and the physical universe and man.Let us leave those topics for a subsequent meeting.And now I suggest
that we unite in asking Carmen to sing for us, to crown the unity that
has marked this discussion with the harmony of her own beautiful
voice."A few moments later, about the small upright piano which the Beaubien
had rented for Carmen, the little group sat in reverent silence, while
the young girl sent out through the little room the harmonious
expression of her own inner life, the life that had never left heaven
for earth.CHAPTER 3


With her exit from the _beau monde_ and her entrance upon the broad
stage of University life, Carmen seemed to have awakened from the
lethargy which her abrupt transition from mediaeval Simiti into the
modern world had occasioned.The static struggle to hold her own
against the rushing currents of materialism had turned at length in
her favor.The lethal influences which
rose about her like stupifying fumes in the courts of fashion had been
lifted and swept away by the fresher and more invigorating breezes
into which her bark had now been drawn.She plunged into her new work joyously; yet not without a deeper
comprehension of its meaning than that of her fellow-students.She
knew that the University was but another stepping-stone, even as her
social life had been; another series of calls and opportunities to
"prove" her God to be immanent good.For she was keenly alive to the materialistic leadings of
the "higher education," and she would stand as a living protest
against them.It had not taken her long to discover the impotence lying at the heart
of so-called modern education.She had not been slow to mark the
disappointment written upon the faces of many of her fellow-students,
who had sought in vain a great awakening light in those sacred
precincts of learning, but, their confidence betrayed, were now
floundering in the devouring morass of materialism.To her keen
insight the University stood revealed as the great panderer to this
latest century's obsessing idea that the true function of education is
expressed in the imparting of changing, human information and a
training for the business of earning one's daily bread according to
the infamous code of the world's carnal social system.The University
did not meet the most urgent need of the race by equipping men to
stand against the great crises of human experience.It did not teach
men to lay aside the counterfeit man of material sense; but rather
emphasized the world's belief in the reality of this man by minutely
detailed courses in his mundane history and the manifestations of his
pitiable ignorance in his wanton crimes and watery ambitions.To
Carmen, God was the most insistent fact of creation.And mankind's
existence could find its only justification in ceaseless, consecrated
manifestation of His harmonious activity.True, the University vaguely
recognized God as infinitely competent.But in the same breath it
confessed its utter ignorance of a demonstrable knowledge of Him, to
know whom alone is life.But their hollow prayers bore no hope, for they knew not how to gain
answers to them.And yet the girl remained in her new environment, awaiting the call to
"come up higher."And meantime she strove to gain daily a wider
knowledge of the Christ-principle, and its application to the needs
and problems of her fellow-men.Her business was the reflection of her
Father's business.The weak, transient,
flighty, so-called intellectual life which she saw about her sent no
call across the calm currents of her thought.Her education was
religious in the strictest, deepest sense, for she was learning to
know God.Though the girl pursued her way quietly, unwilling that the notoriety
which had been fastened upon her should mark her as an object of
curiosity, yet her story soon spread among University circles, and the
first semester was a scant two weeks old before her name had been
debated in the numerous Sororities and Women's Clubs, and quietly
dropped.<DW64> blood coursed in her veins; and the stigma of parental
disgrace lay dark upon her.She lived with a woman of blackened
reputation--a reputation which waxed no brighter under the casual,
malicious comments of J. Wilton Ames, whose great financial strength
had made him a Trustee of this institution of learning.If Carmen
divined the comment that was passed concerning herself, she gave no
indication.But Hitt and Father Waite knew that the girl had not found
favor in the social and fraternal organizations of her mates; and they
knew why.mused Hitt, when he could no longer
restrain himself.Then he called a student to his desk one day, at the
conclusion of his lecture."Miss West," he said, "you are leader in the most prominent Sorority
in the University.I want you to give Miss Carmen Ariza a bid."the girl asked, as she arched her brows.But--well, what if she were a negress?Hers is the
most brilliant mind in the entire student-body!"Race segregation is a divine tenet, scripturally justified.What though the girl's skin vied with the lilies and rosebuds?What
though her hair was the brown of ripe fields?Had not God Almighty
decreed that the <DW64> should remain a drawer of water?Had the Lord designed him the equal of the noble white, He would
have bleached his face, and bridged his flat nose.And the reference to her dark-skinned sisters caused a
little _moue_ of disgust, as she flatly declined to consider Carmen an
eligible candidate for membership in her Society.ejaculated Hitt, who had been brooding over the incident
as he walked home with Father Waite."That toadying, sycophantic,
wealth-worshiping Miss West can see no farther than the epidermis!If
we could have maintained Carmen's reputation as an Inca princess, this
same girl would have fawned at her feet, and begged to kiss the edge
of her robe!And she would have used every art of cajolery to
ingratiate herself into Carmen's favor, to catch the social crumbs
that our girl might chance to drop!""There, there, Hitt," soothed Father Waite."Have you any idea that
Carmen is at all injured by Miss West's supercilious conduct?"You're forgetting the girl's influence, aren't
you?"Hitt gulped his wrath down his long throat."Waite," he blurted, "that
girl's an angel!"She's so real that we don't
understand her--so real that she has been totally misunderstood by the
petty minds that have sought to crush her here in New York, that's
all.""But certainly she is unique--"

"Ah, yes; unique in that she goes about putting her arms around people
and telling them that she loves them.And she is unique in that her purity and goodness hang about her like
an exquisite aura, and make people instinctively turn and look after
her as she passes.Unique in that in her sweet presence one seems to
hear a strain of heavenly music vibrating on the air.So unique that
the dawn, the nesting birds, the wild flowers, the daily sunset,
fairly intoxicate her with ecstasy and make her life a lyric."Hitt essayed to reply; but the words hung in his throat."Yes," continued Father Waite, "she is so unique that when the
empty-headed, vain young Duke of Altern, learning that she had been
thrown out of society because of the base rumor regarding her
parentage, sent her a written statement to the effect that there was
no engagement between them, and demanded that she sign it, she did
so, with a happy smile, with an invocation, with a prayer for blessing
upon those who had tried to ruin her."Hawley-Crowles and Ames and Lafelle
filched La Libertad from her, she would have given them the clothes on
her back with it, if they had demanded them.Yes, she's unique--so
unique that again and again I hear her murmur, as she looks off
absently into space: 'If it is right that he should have a son, then I
want it to be so.'""Referring to--that priest--Jose de Rincon?"And time and again I have heard her say: 'God is
light.Old
Rosendo's grandson, you know.""Waite," he said earnestly, "she is simply illustrating
what would happen to any of us if we threw ourselves wholly upon
God's protecting care, and took our thoughts only from Him.That's
why she can lose her home, her family, her reputation, that
mine--everything--and still stand._She does what we don't dare to
do!_"

"She is a living illustration," replied Father Waite, "of the mighty
fact that there is nothing so practical as _real_ Christianity.I want
you to tell Professor Cane that.He calls her 'the girl with the
Utopian views,' because of her ingenuous replies in his sociological
class.But I want you to show him that she is very far from being
impractical.""I'll do it," said Hitt emphatically."I'll prove to Cane that her
religion is not a visionary scheme for regulating a world inhabited
only by perfect beings, but is a working principle for the every-day
sinner to use in the solution of his daily problems.Moreover, Waite,
she is a vivid illustration of the fact that when the individual
improves, the nation does likewise."I not only get you, but I stand as a proof of your statement,"
returned Father Waite gently.Carmen, her thoughts above, though her feet trod the earth, came and
went, glad and happy.The change in her mode of living from the
supreme luxury of the Hawley-Crowles mansion to the common comforts of
the home where now she dwelt so simply with the Beaubien, seemed not
to have caused even a ripple in the full current of her joy.Her life
was a symphony of thanksgiving; an antiphony, in which all Nature
voiced its responses to her in a diapason, full, rich, and harmonious.Often that autumn she might have been seen standing among the tinted
leaves on the college campus, and drinking in their silent message.And then she might have been heard to exclaim, as she turned her rapt
gaze beyond the venerable, vine-clad buildings: "Oh, I feel as if I
just couldn't stand it, all this wealth of beauty, of love, of
boundless good!"For her dark
story had reared a hedge about her; the taboo rested upon her; and
even in the crowded classrooms the schoolmates of her own sex looked
askance and drew their skirts about them.But if the students avoided her, the faculty did not.And those like
Professor Cane, who had the opportunity and the ability to peer into
the depths of the girl's soul, took an immediate and increasing
interest in her.Often her own naive manners broke down the bars of
convention, and brought her enduring friendships among the men of
learning.This was especially the case with Doctor Morton, Dean of the
School of Surgery.Yielding to a harmless impulse of curiosity, the
girl one afternoon had set out on a trip of exploration, and had
chosen the Anatomy building to begin with.Many odd sights greeted her
eager gaze as she peered into classrooms and exhibit cases; but she
met with no one until she chanced to open the door of Doctor Morton's
private laboratory, and found that eminent man bending over a human
brain, which he was dissecting.The doctor looked up, surprise
written large upon his features as he noted his fair caller.queried the girl, twisting around and
looking at the name on the door to make certain."Yes," replied the genial doctor, with growing interest.He was a
gray-haired, elderly man, slightly inclined to embonpoint, and with
keen, twinkling eyes."Yes, indeed," returned the girl; "I'd love to."Most everybody seems to have heard of me," sighed the girl."Well, it
doesn't make any difference about my coming in here, does it?"She
looked up at him so wistfully that he felt a great tug at his
heartstrings."You're as welcome as the April
sun.""Now tell me," she said eagerly,
looking about."That," said he, taking up the pulpy gray object, "is the brain of my
erstwhile friend and collaborator, Doctor Bolton.murmured Carmen, a facetious twinkle coming into
her eyes as she looked at it."In the interests of science," returned the man, studying her."That
we may increase our knowledge of this marvelous mechanism of thought,
and the laws by which it operates in mental processes.""Then you still blindly seek the living among the dead, don't you?""You think that this poor thing held life, and you
search now among its ashes for the living principle.But, God is life;
and 'Canst thou by searching find out God?'"The man regarded her intently without replying.She bent for a while
over the half-dissected brain in deep thought."Doctor," she said, "life is not structural.God is life; and to know
Him is to reflect life.Doctor, don't
you think it is about time to do away with this business of dying?"The man of science started visibly, and his eyes opened wider.The
abrupt question quite swept him off his feet."You didn't really expect to find anything in this brain, did you?""Why, mostly water, with a few commonplace salts," he answered,
wondering what the next question would be."And can a compound of water and a few commonplace salts _think_?"she
asked, looking intently at him."N--no," he answered tentatively."The brain is not the cause of thought, then, but an effect, is it
not?""Why, really, my dear Miss Carmen, we don't know.We call it the organ
of thought, because in some way thought seems to be associated with
it, rather than with--well, with the liver, or muscles, for example.And we learn that certain classes of mental disturbances are
intimately associated with lesions or clots in the brain.Then:

"Doctor, you wouldn't cut up a machine to discover the motive power,
would you?But that is just what you are doing there with that brain.You are hoping by dissecting it to find the power that made it go,
aren't you?And the power that made it go was mind--life.""But the life is not in the brain now," hazarded the doctor."You see," she went on, "if
the brain was ever alive, it could never cease to be so.If it ever
lived, it could never die.It
manifested only a false sense of life.Who
or what says that the man who owned that brain is dead?Why, the human
mind--human belief.It is the human mind, expressing its belief in
death, and in a real opposite to life, or God.She returned his look
with a confident smile."You believe in evolution, don't you?""Oh, surely," he replied unhesitatingly."Well, then, in the process of evolution, which was evolved first, the
brain, or the mind which operates it and through it?""Why," he replied meditatively, "it is quite likely that they evolved
simultaneously, the brain being the mind's organ of expression.""But don't you see, Doctor, that you are now making the mind really
come first?For that which expresses a thing is always secondary to
the thing expressed.""At any rate, it is quite immaterial to a
practical knowledge of how to meet the brain's ills.I am a practical
man, you know.""I'm sorry to hear that," she said simply."Practical men are so
stupid and ignorant."he exclaimed, putting his hands on his hips and
staring down at the smiling face."And you are so nice and friendly, I wouldn't want to think you stupid
and ignorant," she went on blandly.Well, that kind o' takes the edge off your former classification
of me," he said, greatly amused, yet wondering just what appraisal to
place upon this frank girl."And evolution," she continued, "is an unfolding, isn't it?You see,
the great fact of creation is the creator, infinite mind.Well, that
mind expresses itself in its ideas.And these it is unfolding all the
time.Now a fact always gives rise to a suppositional opposite.The
opposite of a fact is an error.And that is why error has been called
'negative truth.'Of course, there isn't any such thing as negative
truth!And so all error is simply falsity, supposition, without real
existence."Now, the human, or
carnal, mind is the negative truth of the real mind, God.It is
infinite mind's suppositional opposite.And it imitates the
infinite mind, but in a very stupid, blundering way.And so the whole
physical universe manifests evolution, too--an unfolding, or
revealing, of material types, or mental concepts.And all these
manifest the human mind's sense of life, and its equally strong
sense of death.The universe, animals, men, are all human types,
evolved, or unfolded, or revealed, in the human mind.And all are
the human mind's interpretations of infinite mind's real and eternal
and perfect ideas."You know," she laughed, "speaking of 'negative truth', the first
chapter of Genesis sets forth positive truth, and the second chapter
sets forth its opposite, negative truth.But
there it is for everybody to read.And the human mind, of course, true
to its beliefs, clings to the second chapter as the reality.Meantime, Carmen's attention had been attracted to a large microscope
that stood on the table near her.Going to it, she peeped curiously
down into the tube.Well," she suddenly asked, "have
you got the fear germ here?"But when the girl looked up, her face was quite
serious."You do not know it, Doctor, for you are a practical man, but you
haven't anything but fear germs under this glass," she said in a low
voice."Why, those are germs of typhoid and tuberculosis!""And manifestations, externalizations, of the fear germ itself, which
is mental," she added."These things don't cause disease," she went
on, pointing to the slide.Do you scientists know why people die, Doctor?""We really do not know why people die.""Then I'll tell you," she said."_It's because they don't know enough
to live._ This poor Doctor Bolton died because he didn't know that God
was life.He committed sickness, and then paid the penalty, death.He
sinned by believing that there were other powers than God, by
believing that life and thought were in matter.And so he paid the
wages of sin, death.He simply missed the mark, that's all.""You haven't asked me
to sit down," she commented brightly."But, if you don't mind, I
will."the doctor exclaimed, coloring, and hastily
setting out a chair."I really was so interested in what you were
saying that I forgot my manners.""No," she said, shaking her head as she declined the proffered chair,
"I'll sit here, so's I can look straight into your eyes.You go ahead
and cut up poor Yorick, and I'll talk.""You are much more interesting," he
returned, "than poor Bolton, dead or alive.In fact, he really was
quite a bore.But you are like a sparkling mountain rill, even if you
do give me a severe classification.""Well," she replied, "then you are honestly more interested in life
than in death, are you?"Death is _such_ a mistake; and I haven't a bit of use
for it," she continued."It's like making mistakes in music, or
mathematics.Now when we make mistakes in those, we never stop to
discuss them.The world has nearly
talked its poor old head off about the mistakes of sickness and death.It never seems to occur to the world that Jesus always associated
sickness with sin.You know, the Rabbis of his day seem to have hit
upon a great truth, although they didn't make it really practical.They maintained that a sick man could not be healed of his diseases
until all his sins had been forgiven.And so they attempted to forgive
sins and make men clean by their elaborate ceremonies.And nobody got to the root of the difficulty until
Jesus came.And that cured
the disease that was the manifestation of sin.Now I ask, why do you,
nearly two thousand years after his time, still do as the old Rabbis
did, and continue to treat the body--the effect--instead of the mental
cause?But," looking down in meditation, "I suppose if you did that
the people would cry, 'He hath a devil!'They thought I was a witch in
Simiti.""Then you do not believe that disease is
caused by microbes, I take it?"It is a
manifestation of the human mind again.And, as with typhoid fever,
diphtheria, and other diseases, the human mind applies its own
cherished, ignorant beliefs in certain methods, and then renders
innocuous its own manifestations, microbes.The human mind makes its
own diseases, and then in some cases removes the disease, but still by
human, material methods.At last it
yields itself to its false beliefs, and then goes out in what it calls
death.It is all a mental process--all human thought and its various
manifestations.Now why not get beyond microbes and reach the cause,
even of them, the human mind itself?Why do not you men of science do likewise?"Doctor Morton himself took the chair which he had set out for the
girl."What you say," he replied slowly, "is not new to me.But I can
only answer that the world is not ready yet for the great change which
you suggest."What mesmerism you are laboring
under!"Well, then, would he be accepted to-day, if he had not come before?""And I quite agree with you," she said firmly."Now the world has
doctored for more than four thousand years, despite the fact that
health is not sold in bottle or pill form.Doctor, what does the
history of all these centuries of drugging show you?"Carmen waited a moment; then continued:

"Don't they demonstrate the absolute inability of medicines to cure
disease?""Any more than putting men in prison cures
crime?""They at least prove that medication has not _permanently_ removed
disease," he ventured, not wishing to go too far."Doctor," she said earnestly, "that man Jesus, who, according to you,
came too soon, said: 'Without me ye can do nothing.'Well, didn't he
come very, very close to the truth when he made that statement?He did
not say that without drugs or material remedies we could do nothing,
but that without the Christ-principle mankind would continue, as
before, to miss the mark.He showed that disease and discord result
from sin.Sin is lack of righteousness, lack of right-thinking about
things.Its effect,
disease, is mental--a state of discordant consciousness.Can you with
drugs change a state of mind?""Whiskey and opium cause changes in
one's state of mind.""But the human belief of power inherent in whiskey
and opium, or of the human body's reaction to them, causes a change in
the human thought-activity that is called consciousness.The state of
human consciousness changes with the belief, but not the real state of
mind.And Doctor Bolton--"

"Bolton was not sick.He died of natural causes, old age, and general
breakdown," was the doctor's refuge.Carmen laughed and sprang down from the table."What an obstinately
obdurate lot you scientific men are!""Don't you know
that you doctors are only a development of the old'medicine-man'?Bolton isn't dead; and, in the second, there
are no _natural_ causes of death.Why, that's gone out of
fashion, long since.""Then," with a note of banter in his voice, "I take it that you do not
expect to die.""I expect good, nothing but
good, ever!Don't you know that physiologists themselves admit that
the human body is composed of eighty-five per cent water and fifteen
per cent ordinary salts?Can such a combination have intelligence and
sensation?Do you still believe that life is dependent upon lungs,
stomach, or liver?Why, the so-called 'unit cell' breathes, digests,
and manifests life-functions, and yet it has no lungs, no mouth, no
stomach, no organs.It is the human mind, assuming knowledge and power
which it does _not_ possess, that says the sense of life shall depend
upon such organs in the one case and not in the other.And the human
mind could be utterly refuted if men would only learn to use the
Christ-principle.Jesus and Paul used it, and proved material laws to
be only false beliefs.""Well," he replied meditatively, "if you are correct, then the
preachers are way off the track.And I have long since come to the
conclusion that--Well," changing abruptly back to the previous topic,
"so you refute the microbe theory, eh?""I said I did and did not," she laughed."Listen: fear, worry, hatred,
malice, murder, all of which are mental things in themselves, manifest
to the human mind as microbes.These are the hurtful microbes, and
they produce toxins, which poison the system.It is
the Christ-principle.Now you can learn that principle, and how to
apply it.But if you don't care to, why, then you must go on with your
material microbes and poisons, and with your diseases and death, until
you are ready to leave them and turn to that which is real.For all
human-mind activity and manifestation, whether in microbes, death, or
life, is mental, and is but the counterfeit of the real activity of
divine mind, God."Do you know," she pursued earnestly, "I heard a lecture the other day
in which it was said that life is a sort of fermentation in the body.Well, as regards human life, I guess that is so.For the human body is
only a manifestation of the human mind; and the human mind surely is
in a continuous state of ferment!""The lecturer," she continued, "said that the
range of life was from ultra-microbe to man, and that Shakespeare
began as a single cell.The mundane concept of
Shakespeare's body may have unfolded from a cell-concept; but
Shakespeare was a manifestation of mind!And that mind was an
interpretation, though very imperfect, of the mind that is God.Why
can't you materialists raise your eyes above the dust?Why, you would
choke the very avenues of the spirit with mud!"Well, your education seems to be--"

"Yes," she interrupted, "my education is beyond the vagaries that are
so generally taught in the name of knowledge.It does nothing for mankind, except to give them a false
culture.Were the so-called great men of the past really educated?Here is an extract which I copied this afternoon from Hawthorne."She
opened her note book and read:

  "'Ah, but there is a half-acknowledged melancholy like to this
  when we stand in the perfected vigor of our life and feel that
  Time has now given us all his flowers, and that the next work of
  his never-idle fingers must be to steal them one by one away.'"Now," she asked, "was that man really educated?But that theology _could not solve his least earthly problem, nor
meet his slightest need_!Oh, what inexpressibly sad lives so many of
your greatest men have lived!Your Hawthorne, your Longfellow, they
yearned for the rest which they were taught was to follow death.If they
believed in the Christ--and they thought they did--why, then, did they
not rise up and do as he bade them do, put death out?He taught no
such resignation to human beliefs as they practiced!He showed men how
to overcome the world.He looked at her intently for some moments.She seemed, as she stood
there before him, like a thing of gossamer and sunshine that had
drifted into his laboratory, despite the closed door."Say," he suddenly exclaimed, as a new thought struck him, "I'd like
to have you talk with my friend, Reverend Patterson Moore!Pat and I
have barked at each other for many years now, and I'm getting tired.I'd like to shift him to a younger and more vigorous opponent.I
believe you've been providentially sent to relieve me.""You can tell Professor Hitt, and--"

"Hitt, eh?He is very much interested
in these things that you and I have been talking about to-day.We have
regular meetings, with Father Waite, and Mr.Haynerd, and--"

"Well, no wonder you can argue!But--suppose I have Hitt bring me to one of your meetings, eh?"The genial doctor laughed long and incontinently."I imagine Reverend
Pat wouldn't thank you for referring to him that way," he said."He is
a very high Anglican, and his dignity is marvelous--to say nothing of
his self-esteem.Well, we'll see, we'll see."I didn't really mean to come in here, you
know.But I guess I was led, don't you?"And when the door had closed upon her, the doctor sat silently beside
the pulseless brain of his deceased comrade and pondered long.*       *       *       *       *

When Carmen entered the house, late that afternoon, she found the
Beaubien in conversation with Professor Williams, of the University
School of Music.That gentleman had learned through Hitt of the girl's
unusual voice, and had dropped in on his way home to ask that he might
hear and test it.With only a smile for reply, Carmen tossed her books
and hat upon the sofa and went directly to the piano, where she
launched into the weird Indian lament which had produced such an
astounding effect upon her chance visitors at the Elwin school that
day long gone, and which had been running in her thought and seeking
expression ever since her conversation with Doctor Morton a short
while before.For a full half hour she sang, lost in the harmony that poured from
her soul.Father Waite entered, and quietly took a seat.Song after song, most of them the characteristic soft
melodies of her people, and many her own simple improvisations, issued
from the absorbed girl's lips.The Beaubien rose and stole softly from
the room.Father Waite sat with his head resting on his hand, striving
to interpret the message which welled from the depths of his own
being, where hidden, unused chords were vibrating in unison with those
of this young girl.Then, abruptly, the singing stopped, and Carmen turned and faced her
auditors."There," she said, with a happy sigh, "that just _had_ to
come out!""Who, may I ask, was your
teacher?"he said, in a voice husky with emotion.A look of astonishment came into the man's face.He turned to Father
Waite inquiringly.The latter nodded his confirmation of the girl's
words."I wonder if you realize what you
have got, Miss Carmen?""It's a beautiful gift, isn't it?""But--I had thought of asking you to let me train you--but--I--I dare
not undertake to handle such a voice as yours.May I--may I send
Maitre Rossanni to you, the great Italian?"Oh, yes," returned the girl; "I'll sing for anybody.The gift isn't
mine, you know.When the professor had taken his reluctant departure, the Beaubien
returned and handed Carmen a letter.With a cry of joy the girl seized
it and tore it open.It was from Colombia, the second one that her
beloved Rosendo had succeeded in getting down the river to the distant
coast.It had been written three months prior, and it bore many stains
and evidences of the vicissitudes through which it had emerged.Yes,
Rosendo and his family were well, though still at Maria Rosa, far up
the Boque, with Don Nicolas.The war raged below them, but they were
safe."And not a word from Padre Jose, or about him," murmured the girl,
sinking into a chair and clasping the soiled letter to her breast.Father Waite thought of the little newsboy of Cartagena, and his
possible share in the cause of Jose's silence.CHAPTER 4


Carmen's first serious test of her knowledge of English composition
was made early in the semester, in an essay on town life in Colombia;
and so meritorious did her instructor consider it that he advised her
to send it to a prominent literary magazine.The result was that the
essay was accepted, and a request made for further contributions.The girl bubbled with new-found happiness.Then she wrote another, and
still another article on the life and customs of her people.Both
were given publication; and with the money which she received for them
she bought a silk dress for Jude, much to that adoring woman's
surprise and vehement protest.Carmen might have saved the money
toward a piano--but, no; that would have been thinking of herself, and
was inadmissible.Nor did the Beaubien offer any objection."Indeed,"
commented that fond shepherd of this lone lamb, "she would have poured
the money out into somebody's open hand anyway, and it might as well
be Jude's."Then she choked back the tears as she added: "The girl comes home
every night with an empty purse, no matter how full it may have been
in the morning.Carmen's slight success in the field of letters still further aroused
Haynerd's interest.The peacefully somnolent Social Era, he thought,
might awaken to new things under the stimulus of such fresh writing as
hers.Perhaps life did hold something of real value after all.Would
she furnish him with a column or two on the peculiar social aspect of
the metropolis?And the result was that the staid conservative
sheet was given a smart shaking; and several prominent society people
sat up and blinked.It but threw a clear light from a somewhat unusual
angle upon certain phases of New York's social life, and uncovered a
few of the more subtly hidden springs of its peculiar activity.Among those who read her essay in the Social Era was J. Wilton Ames.He first lay back in his chair and laughed uproariously.And then,
when his agents discovered for him the identity of the author, he
glowered.The Beaubien was still standing between him and this budding
genius.And though he might, and would, ultimately ruin the Beaubien
financially, yet this girl, despite her social ostracism, bade fair to
earn with her facile pen enough to maintain them both in luxury.So he
bent anew to his vengeful schemes, for he would make them come to him.As Trustee, he would learn what courses the girl was pursuing in the
University--for he had long known that she was in attendance there.Then he would learn who her associates were; what suggestions and
advice her instructors gave her; and her plans for the future.And he
would trace her sources of income and apply pressure at the most vital
point.He had never in his life been successfully balked.Then Haynerd came to congratulate Carmen again, and to request that
she attend with him the formal opening of the new Ames mansion, the
great Fifth Avenue palace, for he wanted her vivid, first-hand
impressions for his account of the brilliant affair in the Social Era.As reporters, he explained, they would of necessity remain in
seclusion, and the girl might disguise to such an extent as to prevent
recognition, if she chose.It was business for him, and an opportunity
for rich experience for her.And the fearless girl went, because it
would help Haynerd, though the Beaubien inwardly trembled.Invitations to the number of three hundred had been issued to the
_elite_ of New York, announcing the formal opening of the newly
finished, magnificent Ames dwelling.These invitations were wrought in
enamel on cards of pure gold.A month prior to the opening, the
newspapers had printed carefully-worded announcements of the return of
Mrs.J. Wilton Ames and her daughter, after a protracted stay at
various foreign baths and rest-cures in the hope of restoring the
former's impaired health.Ames now felt that she could no
longer deprive society of her needed activities, and so had returned
to conduct it through what promised to be a season of unusual
brilliancy.The papers did not, however, state that J. Wilton had
himself recalled her, after quietly destroying his bill of divorce,
because he recognized the necessity of maintaining the social side of
his complicated existence on a par with his vast business affairs.As Carmen and Haynerd approached the huge, white marble structure,
cupolaed, gabled, buttressed, and pinnacled, an overwhelming sense of
what it stood for suddenly came upon the girl, and she saw revealed in
a flash that side of its owner's life which for so many months she had
been pondering.The great shadows that seemed to issue from the
massive exterior of the building swept out and engulfed her; and she
turned and clasped Haynerd's arm with the feeling that she would
suffocate were she to remain longer in them."Perk up, little one," said Haynerd, taking her hand."We'll go round
to the rear entrance, and I will present my business card there.Ames's secretary telephoned me instructions, and I said I was going to
bring a lady reporter with me."Carmen caught her breath as she passed through the tall, exquisitely
wrought iron gateway and along the marble walk which led to the rear.Up the winding steps to the front entrance, where swung the marvelous
bronze doors which had stirred the imaginations of two continents,
streamed the favored of the fashionable world.Among them Carmen saw
many whom she recognized.The buffoon, Larry Beers, was there,
swinging jauntily along with the bejeweled wife of Samson, the
multimillionaire packer.Kane and his wife, and Weston followed.Outside the gates there was incessant chugging of automobiles, mingled
with the shouted orders of the three policemen detailed to direct the
traffic.A pinched, ragged urchin and his tattered little sister crept
up and peered wildly through the iron pickets of the fence; but a
sharp rap from a policeman's club sent them scattering.Carmen stood
for a moment in the shadows and watched the swarm mount the marble
steps and enter through those wonderful doors.There were congressmen
and senators, magnates and jurists, distillers and preachers.Each one
owed his tithe of allegiance to Ames.Some were chained to him hard
and fast, nor would break their bonds this side of the grave.There were those who grew white under his most casual
glance.There were others who knew that his calloused hand was closing
about them, and that when it opened again they would fall to the
ground, dry as dust.Others, like moths, not yet singed, were hovering
ever closer to the bright, cruel flame.Reverend Darius Borwell,
bowing and smiling, alighted from his parochial car and tripped
blithely up the glistening marble steps.Each and all, wrapping the
skeleton of grief, greed, shame, or fear beneath swart broadcloth and
shimmering silk, floated up those ghostly steps as if drawn by a
tremendous magnet incarnate in the person of J. Wilton Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away.Hawley-Crowles sigh in the wake of that gilded assembly?Did the moans
of poor, grief-stricken Mrs.Gannette, sitting in her poverty and
sorrow, die into silence against those bronze doors?Was he, the being
who dwelt in that marble palace, the hydra-headed embodiment of the
carnal, Scriptural, age-old power that opposes God?How many others there were
scattered through the house itself, Haynerd could only guess.But he
passed inspection and was admitted with the girl.A butler took
immediate charge of them, and led them quickly through a short passage
and to an elevator, by which they mounted to another floor, where,
opening a paneled oak door, the dignified functionary preceded them
into a small reception hall, with lavatories at either end.Here he
bade them remove their wraps and await his return."Well," commented Haynerd, with a light, nervous laugh, "we've crossed
the Rubicon!A moment later the butler returned with a sharp-eyed young woman, Mrs."You will be very careful in your report," the latter began at once in
a business-like manner."And you will submit the same to me for
approval before it is published in your magazine.Ames deems that
imperative, since your recent publication of an essay on modern
society in this city.I have a list here of the guests, their business
and social standing, and other data.You
will say that this is the most brilliant assemblage ever gathered
under one roof in New York.The wealth represented here to-night will
total not less than three billion dollars.The jewels alone displayed
will foot up not less than twenty millions.Now, let me see," again
consulting her notes.Haynerd stole a covert glance at Carmen and winked."The chef," the secretary resumed, "was brought over from Paris by
Mrs.His name, Pierre Lotard, descendant of
the famous chef of the Emperor Napoleon First.He considers that his
menu to-night surpasses anything he ever before achieved.""May I ask," interrupted Haynerd, "the probable cost of the supper?""Yes, perhaps you had better mention that item.It will be in the
neighborhood of three hundred dollars a plate.House and table
decorations, about eight thousand dollars.The menu cards were hand-illuminated by Parisian
artists, and each bears a sketch illustrative or suggestive of the
guest to whom it is given.""Three thousand, if I correctly recall it," was the nonchalant reply."As to the viands, you will mention that they have been gathered from
every part of the world.Now come with me, and I will give you a hasty
sketch of the house, while the guests are assembling in the grand
salon.Then you will remain in the balcony, where you will make what
notes you wish on the dress displayed.Refreshments will be served to
you later in this waiting room.I need not remind you that you are not
expected to mingle with the guests, nor to address any one.Keep to
the balcony, and quite out of view."Opening a door opposite the one through which she had entered, the
young woman led her charges directly out upon the great marble balcony
overlooking the grand salon below.A rush of brilliant light engulfed
them, and a potpourri of chatter and laughter, mingled with soft music
from a distant organ, and the less distinct notes of the orchestra in
the still more distant ballroom, rose about them in confused babel, as
they tiptoed to the exquisitely carved marble railing and peered down
upon the gorgeous pageant.The ceiling rose far above them, delicately
tinted like a soft Italian sky.The lofty walls dropped, like
gold-gray veils, to the richly carved paneled wainscoting beneath,
which had once lined the halls of a mediaeval castle on the Rhine.The
great windows were hidden behind rare Venetian lace curtains, over
which fell hangings of brocade, repeating the soft tints of the wall
and the brocade-covered chairs and divans ranged close about the sides
of the splendid room.On the floor lay a massive, priceless Persian
carpet, dating from the fifteenth century.Haynerd drew a long breath, and whistled softly.From the end of the
salon he could mark the short flight of steps which led to the
mezzanine, with its walls heavily tapestried, and broken by rich oak
doors opening into lavatories and lounging rooms, itself widening at
the far end into the grand billiard and smoking parlors, done off in
Circassian walnut, with tables and furniture to harmonize.From the
mezzanine he saw the grand stairway falling away in great, sweeping
curves, all in blended marble from the world's greatest quarries, and
delicately chased and carved into classic designs.Two tapestries,
centuries old, hung from the walls on either side.Far above, the oak
ceiling, for which the _Schwarzwald_ had been ranged, was overlaid
with pure gold leaf.The whole was suffused with the glow of myriad
hidden and inverted lights, reflected in a thousand angles from
burnished gold and marble and rarest gems.He groped in the chambers of
his imagery for some superlative adjective to express his emotion
before this colossal display of wealth.But his ample vocabulary had
faded quite.He could only shake his head and give vent to the inept
remark, "Swell--by George!"The secretary, without replying, motioned them to follow.Passing
noiselessly around the balcony to the opposite side, she indicated a
door below, leading off to the right from the grand salon."That room beyond," she said, "is the petit salon.It is
in panels from French chateaux, covered with Gobelin tapestry.Now
from here you can see a bit of the music room.The grand organ cost,
installed, about two hundred thousand dollars.It is electrically
controlled, with its pipes running all around the room, so as to give
the effect of music coming from every corner.""There are three art galleries beyond, two for paintings, and one for
sculpture.Ames has without doubt the finest art collection in
America.It includes several Titians, Veroneses, da Vincis, Turners,
three Rubens, and two Raphaels.By the way, it may interest you to
know that his negotiations for the Murillo Madonna were completed
to-day, and the picture will be sent to him immediately.""Might I ask what he paid for it?""You may say that he paid something over three hundred thousand
dollars for it," she replied, in a quite matter of fact tone."Now,"
she continued, "you will go back to your first position, near the door
of the waiting room, and remain there until I return.I may have an
opportunity later to show you the library.Great
carved stone fireplace, taken from a Scotch castle.Hundreds of rare
volumes and first editions.Now, if any one approaches, you can step
behind the screen and remain out of view.You have chairs and a table
there for your writing.With this final injunction she turned and disappeared into the little
waiting room from which they had emerged.For some moments Carmen and Haynerd stood looking alternately at
each other and about them at their magnificent environment.Both had
seen much of the gilded life, and the girl had dwelt some months in
its alien atmosphere.But neither had ever witnessed such a
stupendous display of material wealth as was here unfolded before
their astonished gaze.At the head of the grand stairway stood the
Ames trio, to receive their resplendent guests.The women were
magnificently gowned.But Ames's massive form in its simple black
and chaste linen was the cynosure of all eyes.Even Haynerd could
not suppress a note of admiration as he gazed at the splendid figure."And yet," he murmured, "a victim, like the rest, of the great
delusion."Carmen laid down the opera glasses through which she had been studying
the man."He is an expression," she said, "of the American ideal--the
ideal of practical material life.It is toward his plane of life that
this country's youth are struggling, at, oh, what a cost!Think,
think, what his immense, misused revenue could do, if unselfishly
used!Why, the cost of this single night's show would put two hundred
men like Father Waite through a four-year course in the University,
and train them to do life's work!"Oh, further opportunities to increase his pile, I suppose," returned
Haynerd, shrugging his shoulders.And does he need further
opportunities to accumulate money?Does he not rather need some one to
show him the meaning of life, how to really live?"And it may be your mission, Carmen, to do just that.But if you don't, then I sincerely hope the man may die before he
discovers that all that he has achieved, his wealth, his prestige, his
power, have not been worth striving for!""He hasn't the slightest idea of the meaning of life," she murmured,
looking down upon the glittering throng."They put me in mind of Carlyle's famous remark, as
he stood looking out across the London Strand: 'There are in this city
some four million people, mostly fools.'How mean, narrow and hard
their lives are!These are the high priests of vested privilege, of
mediaevalism, of old institutions whose perpetual maintenance, even in
a generation that has progressed far beyond them, is a fungus blight
upon us.Ah, there's little Willie Van Wot, all dolled out!He's
glorifying his Creator now by devoting his foolish little existence to
coaching trips along the New England shore.He reminds me of the Fleet
street poet who wrote a century ago of the similar occupation of a
young dandy of that day--

                  What can little T. O. do?Why, drive a Phaeton and Two!!!Can little T. O. do no more?Yes, drive a Phaeton and Four!!!!"He's an interesting outgrowth of our unique social system, eh?""We must follow Emerson and treat them all as we do pictures, look at
them in the best light," murmured Carmen."Aye, hang them in the best light!""But make sure
they're well hung!There goes the pseudo-princess, member of the royal
house of England.I tell you, under
the splash and glitter you can see the feet of clay, eh?""Yes," smiled Carmen, "resting upon the high heel."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture of disgust."The women of
fashion seem to feel that the Creator didn't do a good job when He
designed the feminine sex--that He should have put a hump where the
heel is, so's to slant the foot and make comfortable walking
impossible, as well as to insure a plentiful crop of foot-troubles and
deformities.The Chinese women used to manifest a similarly insane
thought.The human mind is a cave
of black ignorance!"Carmen did not reply, but bent her attention again to the throng
below."Look there," said Haynerd, indicating a stout, full-toiletted woman,
resplendent with diamonds."That's our eminent French guest, Madam
Carot.She severed herself from her tiresome consort last year by
means of a bichloride tablet deftly immersed in his coffee, and then,
leaving a sigh of regret hovering over his unhandsome remains,
hastened to our friendly shores, to grace the _beau monde_ with her
gowns and jewels."Carmen turned to him with a remonstrance of incredulity."The Social Era got the whole spicy
story.See, she's drifted up to young Watson!Coquetting for a
husband still, the old buzzard!""Well, it's fact, anyway," persisted the society monitor."And there
beyond her is fat little Mrs.Stuffenheimer, with her two unlovely,
red-faced daughters.Ah, the despairing mamma is still vainly angling
for mates for her two chubby Venuses!If they're not married off
properly and into good social positions soon, it's mamma for the scrap
heap!it's positively tragic to see these anxious mothers
at Newport and Atlantic City and other fashionable places, rushing
madly hither and yon with their marriageable daughters, dragging them
from one function to another in the wild hope that they may ultimately
land a man.Worry and pain dig deep furrows into poor mamma's face if
she sees her daughters fading into the has-been class.It requires
heroism, I say, to travel in society!Well,"
taking up his notebook, "we must get busy now.By the way, how's your
shorthand progressing?""Oh, splendidly," replied the girl, her eyes still upon the massive
figure of Ames.Then, recovering from her abstraction, "I can write as
fast in it now as in longhand."For more than an hour the two sat in the seclusion of the splendid
balcony, looking down upon the scene of magnificence below.Through
the mind of the young girl ran a ceaseless paean of thanksgiving for
her timely deliverance from the trammels which she so well knew
enshackled these glittering birds of paradise.With it mingled a
great, consuming desire, a soul-longing to pour into the vacuity of
high society the leaven of her own pure thought.In particular did her
boundless love now go out to that gigantic figure whose ideals of life
this sumptuous display of material wealth and power expressed.Was it only a vainglorious
exhibition of his own human prowess?Was it an announcement,
magnificent beyond compare, that he, J. Wilton Ames, had attained the
supreme heights of gratified world ambition?That the world at last
lay at his feet?And that over it brooded the giant's lament that
there remained nothing more to conquer?But, if so, the girl at least
knew that the man's herculean efforts to subdue the material world
were as nothing.The real conquest lay still before him, the conquest
of self.And when that were faced and achieved, well she knew that no
such garish display as this would announce the victory to a breathless
world.The bustling little social secretary again appeared, and briefly
announced the production of an opera in the auditorium, to which she
had come to conduct them.Passing through the little waiting room and
to the elevator, they quickly mounted to the unoccupied gallery of the
theater above.The parquet, which would seat nearly a thousand
spectators, was rapidly filling with an eager, curious throng.The
Ames trio and some of the more distinguished guests were already
occupying the gorgeously decorated boxes at the sides.An orchestra of
fifty pieces was visible in the hollow below the stage.Caroni, the
famous grand opera leader, stood ready to conduct.The opera itself
was the much discussed music drama, Salome."Now," commented Haynerd to his fair, wondering companion, who was
lost in contemplation of the magnificent mural decorations of the
little theater, "we will see something rare, for this opera has been
called the most artistic piece of indecency known to the stage.Ames has got Marie Deschamps for the title role.She'll cost
him not less than five thousand dollars for this one night.And--see
here," drawing Carmen's attention to the bill, "Marcou and Corvalle
besides!These stars get three thousand
dollars a night during the regular season."Every phase of sophistication was manifested in that glittering
audience when the curtain rose and the sensational theme was
introduced.But to none came thoughts like those which clamored for
admittance at the portals of Carmen's mentality.In the bold challenge
of the insanely sensual portrayal of a carnal mind the girl saw the
age-old defiance of the spirit by the flesh.In the rolls of the
wondrous music, in its shrieks, its pleadings, and its dying echoes,
she heard voiced again the soul-lament of a weary world searching
vainly in the mazes of human thought for truth.As the wonderful
Deschamps danced weirdly before her in the ghastly light and fell
gloating over her gory trophy, Carmen saw but the frantic struggles of
a diseased soul, portrayed as the skilled surgeon lays bare the
malignant growth that is eating the quivering tissues of a human
frame.The immodesty of dress, the sensual suggestiveness of the
dance, the brutal flouting of every element of refinement and
delicacy, blazoned in frenzied tone and movement the bloody orgy and
dance of death which goes on incessantly upon the stage of human life,
and ends in the mad whirl and confusion and insane gibbering over the
lifeless trophies for which mankind sell their very souls.commented Haynerd, when the final
curtain dropped."Yes, even to a vitiated taste.The passionate thirst
for the sensational has led to this sickening display of salacity--"

"Splendid, wasn't it?"came in tones of admiration from the social
secretary, who had returned to conduct her charges back to the balcony
before the guests emerged from the theater."You will run the program
in full, and comment at some length on the expense attached," she went
on."You have just witnessed the private production of a full opera,
unabridged, and with the regular operatic cast.Supper will follow in
a half hour.Meantime, you will remain in the balcony where you were
before."Returning to their former position, Carmen sank into a chair at the
little table behind the screen, and strove to orient her thought.Haynerd sat down beside her to arrange his voluminous notes.Presently
footsteps were heard, and the sound of voices.Haynerd glanced through
the hinge of the screen.he whispered, "here comes Ames
and--who's with him?Showing him about, I
suppose."Carmen gazed at the approaching men with fascinated eyes, although she
saw but one, the towering magician who had reared this fairy palace.She saw Ames lead his companion to the door of the little waiting room
at their right, and heard the congressman protest against entering."But we can talk undisturbed in here," urged Ames, his hand on the
door."Better remain out here on the balcony," replied the congressman
nervously, as he moved toward the railing.He understood the
man's repugnance fully."You know, Wales," he said easily, going to the railing and peering
over at the brilliant assemblage below, "if I could get the heathen
Chinee to add an extra half-inch to his shirt length, I'd make a
hundred millions.And then, perhaps, I wouldn't need to struggle with
your Ways and Means Committee as I do.By the way, the cotton schedule
will be reported out unchanged, I presume."He turned and looked
quizzically at his companion as he said this.Wales trembled slightly when he replied to the question he had been
awaiting."Parsons will vote for it," he said
suggestively.Ames, is committed to
the high tariff principle.We can not let in a flood of foreign
cotton--"

"Then you want the fight between the farmers and spinners to continue,
eh?""You don't seem to realize that in the
end both will get more money than they are getting now, and that it
will come from the consumer, who will pay vastly higher for his
finished products, in addition to the tariff.Ames," returned the congressman
tenaciously."Look here, Wales," said Ames, turning savagely upon his companion.Their
cooeperative associations must be smashed.The tariff schedule which
you have before your Committee will do it.Ames," replied the congressman, "I--I am opposed to the constant
manipulation of cotton by you rich men.I--"

"There," interrupted Ames, "never mind explaining your conscientious
scruples.What I want to know is, do you intend to cast your vote for
the unaltered schedule?"Ames, I can't--"

"H'm," murmured Ames.Then, with easy nonchalance, turning to an
apparently irrelevant topic as he gazed over the railing, "I heard
just before coming from my office this evening that the doors of the
Mercantile Trust would not open to-morrow.A lot of my
personal friends are heavily involved.Ames and Company will take over their tangible assets; I believe
you were interested, were you not?"He glanced at the trembling man
out of the corners of his eyes.His hands shook as he grasped the railing before
him and tried to steady himself."It--it--yes--very hard," murmured the dazed man.But step into the waiting room and 'phone the newspapers.Representative Wales was serving his first term in Congress.His
election had been a matter of surprise to everybody, himself included,
excepting Ames.Wales knew not that his detailed personal history had
been for many months carefully filed in the vaults of the Ames tower.Nor did he ever suspect that his candidacy and election had been
matters of most careful thought on the part of the great financier
and his political associates.But when he, a stranger to congressional
halls, was made a member of the Ways and Means Committee, his
astonishment overleaped all bounds.Then Ames had smiled his own
gratification, and arranged that the new member should attend the
formal opening of the great Ames palace later in the year.Meantime,
the financier and the new congressman had met on several occasions,
and the latter had felt no little pride in the attention which the
great man had shown him.And so the path to fame had unrolled steadily before the guileless
Wales until this night, when the first suspicions of his thraldom had
penetrated and darkened his thought.Then, like a crash from a clear
sky, had come the announcement of the Mercantile Trust failure.And as
he stood there now, clutching the marble railing, his thought busy
with the woman and the two fair children who would be rendered
penniless by this blow, the fell presence of the monster Ames seemed
to bend over him as the epitome of ruthless, brutal, inhuman cunning."How much are you likely to lose by this failure?""Not less than fifty thousand
dollars," he replied in a husky voice.stooping and apparently taking up an object that had
been lying on the floor back of the congressman.Wales took the book in a dazed, mechanical way."Why--I have no--this
is not mine," he murmured, gazing alternately at the pass book and at
Ames."Your name's on it, at least," commented Ames laconically."And the
book's been issued by our bank, Ames and Company.Guess you've
forgotten opening an account there, let me see, yes, a week ago."He
took the book and opened it."Ah, yes, I recall the incident now.The book, made out in his name on Ames
and Company, showed a deposit to his credit of fifty thousand
dollars!Ames slipped his arm through the confused congressman's, and started
with him down the balcony."You see," he said, as they moved away,
"the Mercantile failure will not hit you as hard as you thought.Now,
about that cotton schedule, when you cast your vote for it, be sure
that--" The voice died away as the men disappeared in the distance,
leaving Carmen and Haynerd staring blankly at each other."We must save them both," said Carmen quietly."I could make my everlasting fortune out of this!"exclaimed Haynerd
excitedly."And lose your soul," replied the girl.Ames, and
tell him that we overheard his conversation.Haynerd then smiled, but it was a hard smile, coming from one who knew
the world."Listen, my dear girl," he said, "we will keep quiet, you
and I. To mention this would be only to court disaster at the hands of
one who would strangle us at the slightest intimation of our
knowledge."I can see but the right," returned Carmen determinedly."But, my dear girl," cried Haynerd, now thoroughly alarmed both for
himself and her, "he would ruin us!We had
no intention of hearing; and so let it be as if we had not heard."Haynerd, I could not, if I
would.Ames is being used by evil; and it is making him a channel
to ruin Mr.Shall I stand idly by and permit it?She rose, with a look of fixed resolution on her face.Haynerd sprang
to his feet and laid a detaining hand upon her arm.As he did so, the
screen was quickly drawn aside, and Kathleen Ames and two of her young
companions bent their curious gaze in upon them.Absorbed in their
earnest conversation, Carmen and Haynerd had not heard the approach of
the young ladies, who were on a tour of inspection of the house before
supper."Reporters for the Social Era, Miss Ames," explained Haynerd, hastily
answering the unspoken question, while he made a courteous bow.she cried, instantly
recognizing Carmen, and drawing back.asked one of the young ladies, as her eyes roved
over Carmen's tense, motionless figure.cried Kathleen, spurting her venom at Carmen, while
her eyes snapped angrily and her hands twitched."When the front door
is closed against you, you sneak in through the back door!Leave this
house, instantly, or I shall have you thrown into the street!""She is a low, <DW64> wench!"She foisted herself upon society, and was discovered
and kicked out!Her father is a dirty <DW64> priest, and her mother a
low--"

Haynerd rushed to the maddened girl and clapped his hand over her
mouth."Hush, for God's sake, Miss Ames!"Then, to her companions,
"Take her away!"But a house detective, attracted by the loud conversation, had come up
and interposed."I can not put them out if they have his
permission to remain," he explained to the angry Kathleen.In a few moments, during which the little group stood tense and quiet,
Ames himself appeared.turning inquiringly to Haynerd.Her article in last week's Social Era was a corker.But,"
staring from Kathleen to the others, "what's the row?""I want that creature put out of the house!"demanded Kathleen,
trembling with rage and pointing to Carmen."Tut, tut," returned Ames easily."She's on business, and has my
permission to remain.that's a good joke," winking at
Haynerd and breaking into a loud laugh."You put one over on us there,
old man!"Scalding tears of anger and humiliation were streaming down
Kathleen's face."If she remains, I shall go--I shall leave the
house--I will not stay under the same roof with the lewd creature!""Very well, then, run along," said Ames, taking the humiliated
Kathleen by the shoulders and turning her about."I will settle this
without your assistance."Then he motioned to the house detectives to
depart, and turned to Haynerd and Carmen."Come in here," he said,
leading the way to the little waiting room, and opening the door.but you belong down stairs with the rest," he ejaculated as he
faced Carmen, standing before him pale but unafraid."There isn't one
down there who is in your class!"he exclaimed, placing his hands upon
her shoulders and looking down into her beautiful face."And," he
continued with sudden determination, "I am going to take you down, and
you will sit at the table with me, as my special guest!"A sudden fear gripped Haynerd, and he started to interpose.An expression of surprise and inquiry came into Ames's face."You mean Congressman--"

Then he stopped abruptly, and looked searchingly at Carmen and her
companion.Ames's expression
of surprise gave place to one dark and menacing."You were behind that screen when Congressman Wales and I--"

"Yes," returned Carmen calmly.Ames stood like a huge, black cloud, glowering down upon the slender
girl."You are going to tell him that the fifty thousand dollars are just a
loan, and that he may vote as he chooses, aren't you?""You
will not ruin his life, and the lives of his wife and babies, will
you?You would never be happy, you know, if you did."Her voice was as
quiet as the morning breeze."You come into my house to play spy, eh?And
if I had not caught you when I did you would have written another
interesting article for the Social Era, wouldn't you?I'll
break you, Haynerd, and your infernal sheet into a million pieces if
you dare print any such rot as this!And as for you, young lady--"

"You can do nothing to me, Mr.Ames; and you don't really want to,"
said Carmen quickly."My reputation, you know--that is, the one which
you people have given me--is just as black as it could be, isn't it?"It doesn't really make any
difference to you, Mr.Ames," she said, "whether the cotton schedule
is passed or not.You still have your millions--oh, so much more
than you will ever know what to do with!Wales, he has his
wife and his babies and his good reputation--would you rob him of
those priceless treasures, just to make a few dollars more for
yourself?--dollars that you can't spend, and that you won't let
others have?"During the girl's quiet talk Ames was regaining his self-control.When
she concluded he turned to Haynerd."Miss Carmen can step out into the
balcony.You and I will arrange this matter together," he said."Now," said Ames significantly, and in a low voice, "what's your
price?"Instantly the girl turned back and threw herself between the two men.she cried, her eyes flashing as she confronted
Ames.shouted Ames, who had lost himself completely, "I will
crush him like a dirty spider!And you, I'll drag you through the
gutters and make your name a synonym of all that is vile in
womanhood!"Carmen stepped quietly to the elevator and pressed the signal button.cried the enraged Ames, starting
toward her.The girl drew herself up with splendid dignity, and faced him
fearlessly."We _shall_ leave your house, and now, Mr."You and that for which you stand can not touch us!The carnal
mind is back of you!She moved away from him, then turned and stood for a moment, flashing,
sparkling, radiant with a power which he could not comprehend.You are blinded and deceived by human lust and
greed.But the god you so ignorantly worship now will some day totter
and fall upon you.Then you will awake, and you will see your present
life as a horrid dream."Carmen and the dazed Haynerd stepped quickly
into it and descended without opposition to the lower floor.A few
moments later they were again in the street and hurrying to the
nearest car line."Girlie," said Haynerd, mopping the perspiration from his brow, "we're
in for it now--and I shall be crushed!But you--I think your God will
save you.""His arm is not shortened," she murmured, "that
He can not save us both."CHAPTER 5

ON the Monday morning following the Ames reception the society columns
of the daily papers still teemed with extravagant depictions of the
magnificent affair.On that same morning, while Haynerd sat gloomily
in the office of the Social Era, meditating on his giant adversary's
probable first move, Carmen, leaving her studies and classes, sought
out an unpretentious home in one of the suburbs of the city, and for
an hour or more talked earnestly with the timid, frightened little
wife of Congressman Wales.Then, her work done, she dismissed the
whole affair from her mind, and hastened joyously back to the
University."But," she
reflected, as she dwelt on his conduct and words of the previous
Saturday evening, "he is not ready for it yet.And when he is, I will
go to him.And Kathleen--well, I will help her by seeing only the real
child of God, which was hidden that night by the veil of hatred and
jealousy.And that veil, after all, is but a shadow."That evening the little group of searchers after God assembled again
in the peaceful precincts of the Beaubien cottage.It was their third
meeting, and they had come together reverently to pursue the most
momentous inquiry that has ever stimulated human thought.Haynerd and Carmen had said little relative to the Ames reception; but
the former, still brooding over the certain consequences of his brush
with Ames, was dejected and distraught.Carmen, leaning upon her
sustaining thought, and conceding no mite of power or intelligence to
evil, glowed like a radiant star.she asked of Haynerd, drawing him to one
side."Are you giving ear to the voices of evil, or good?For those thoughts which are real to you
will become outwardly manifested, you know."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture signifying
defeat."And the insults of that arrogant daughter of his--"

"She did not insult me," said Carmen quickly."She could not, for she
doesn't know me.She merely denounced her concept of me, and not my
real self.She vilified what she thought was Carmen Ariza; but it was
only her own thought of me that she insulted.And such
a concept of me as she holds deserves denouncing, doesn't it?""Well, what are we going to do?""We are going to know," she whispered, "that we two with God
constitute an overwhelming majority."She said nothing about her visit
to the Wales home that morning, but pressed his hand, and then went to
take her place at the table, where Father Waite was already rapping
for order."My friends," began that earnest young man, looking lovingly about at
the little group, "as we are gathered here we symbolize that
analytical, critical endeavor of the unbiased human mind to discover
the essence of religion.Religion is that which binds us to absolute
truth, and so is truth itself.If there is a God, we believe from our
former investigations that He must be universal mind.This belief
carries with it as necessary corollaries the beliefs that He must be
perfect, eternal, and self-existent.must
then receive its sufficient answer in the staggering statement that He
has always existed, unchanged and unchangeable."A sigh from Haynerd announced that quizzical soul's struggle to grasp
a statement at once so radical and stupendous."True," continued Father Waite, addressing himself to his doubting
friend, "the acceptance as fact of what we have deduced in our
previous meetings must render the God of orthodox theology quite
obsolete.But, as a compensation, it gives to us the most enlarged and
beautiful concept of Him that we have ever had.It ennobles, broadens,
purifies, and elevates our idea of Him.It destroys forever our
belittling view of Him as but a magnified human character, full of
wrath and caprice and angry threats, and delighting in human
ceremonial and religious thaumaturgy.And, most practical of all for
us, it renders the age-long problem of evil amenable to solution."Just then came a ring at the front door; and a moment later the
Beaubien ushered Doctor Morton into the room.All rose and hastened to
welcome him."I--I am sure," began the visitor, looking at Carmen, "that I am not
intruding, for I really come on invitation, you know.Miss Carmen,
first; and then, our good friend Hitt, who told me this afternoon that
you would probably meet this evening.I--I pondered the matter some
little time--ah, but--well, to make it short, I couldn't keep away
from a gathering so absolutely unique as this--I really couldn't."she exclaimed, her eyes dancing,
"I am glad you came.""And I, too," interposed Haynerd dryly, "for now we have two
theological Philistines."Ah, my friend," replied the doctor, "I am simply an advocate of
religious freedom, not a--"

"And religious freedom, as our wise Bill Nye once said, is but the art
of giving intolerance a little more room, eh?"returned Haynerd with a
laugh."You are a Philistine," he said.Carmen took the doctor by the arm and led him to a place beside her at
the table."You--you didn't bring poor Yorick?"she whispered, with a
glint of mischief in her bright eyes."No," laughed the genial visitor, "he's a dead one, you told me.""Yes," replied the girl, "awfully dead!He is an outward manifestation
of dead human beliefs, isn't he?But now listen, Father Waite is going
to speak."After a brief explanation to the doctor of the purpose of the
meeting, and a short resume of their previous deductions, Father Waite
continued the exposition of his subject."The physical universe," he said, "is to human beings a reality.And
yet, according to Spencer's definition of reality, we must admit that
the universe as we see it is quite unreal.For the real is that which
endures.""And you mean to say that the universe will not endure?""The phenomena of the universe, even as
we see it, are in a state of ceaseless change.Birth, growth,
maturity, decay, and death seems to be the law for all things
material."But," again urged Haynerd, "matter itself remains, is indestructible.""Our friend, Doctor Morton, will
corroborate my statement, I am sure.""It is quite true," he said in reply.The discovery, in the past few years, of the
tremendously important fact that matter disintegrates and actually
disappears, has revolutionized all physical science and rendered the
world's text books obsolete.""The radium atom, we find, lasts some
seventeen hundred years, or a trifle longer.What becomes of it when
it is destroyed?We can only say that it disappears from human
consciousness.""And so you reason that the whole material universe will ultimately
disappear from the human consciousness?""Yes," returned Hitt, "I feel certain of it.Let us consider of what
the universe consists.For many months I have been pondering this
topic incessantly.I find that I can agree, in a measure, with those
scientists who regard the physical universe as composed of only a few
elementary constituents, namely, matter, energy, space, and time--"

"Each one of these elements is mental," interrupted Carmen."And the physical universe, even from the
human standpoint, is, therefore, wholly mental.""No," interposed Father Waite; "we see only our mental concept of a
universe, for seeing is wholly a mental process."But now," resumed Hitt, "to get back to the supposed reality of the
physical universe, let us examine its constituents.First, let us
consider its unity established by the harmonious interplay of the
forces permeating it.This great fact is what led Herbert Spencer to
conclude that the universe could have but one creator, one ruler, and
that polytheism was untenable.""We are quite agreed regarding that," said Father Waite."If the
Creator is mind, He is of very necessity infinite and omnipotent;
hence there can be but one Creator."Would it exist, but as a convenience for the human mind?Is
it not really a creation of that mind?And, lastly, is it not merely a
mental concept?""Our consciousness of time," replied Carmen, "is only our awareness of
a continuous series of mental states.""That classifies it exactly," said Hitt, "and renders it wholly
mental."We are accustomed to say,
loosely, that space is that in which we see things about us.But in
what does the process of seeing consist?What I
really mean is that I am conscious of a chair.The process of seeing,
we are told, is this: light, coming from the chair, enters the eye and
casts an image of the chair upon the retina, much as a picture is
thrown upon the ground glass of a camera.Then, in some way, the
little rods and cones--the branching tips of the optic nerve which
project from the retina--are set in motion by the light-waves.This
vibration is in some mysterious manner carried along the optic nerve
to a center in the brain, and--well, then the mind becomes cognizant
of the chair out there, that's all.""Do you mean
to say," she queried, "that, after thousands of years of thought and
investigation, mankind now know nothing more than that about the
process of seeing?""Then all I've got to say," put in Haynerd, "is that the most
remarkable thing about you learned men is your ignorance!""I find it is only the fool who is cocksure," he
replied."Now," said Hitt, resuming the conversation, "let us go a step further
and inquire, first, What is light?since the process of seeing is
absolutely dependent upon it.""Light," offered the doctor, "is vibrations, or wave-motion, so
physicists tell us.""Light, we say, consists of vibrations.Not
vibrations of anything tangible or definitely material, but--well,
just vibrations in the abstract.Now
let us concede that these vibrations in some way get to the brain
center; and then let us ask, Is the mind there, in the brain, awaiting
the arrival of these vibrations to inform it that there is a chair
outside?"Haynerd indulged in a cynical laugh."It is too serious for laughter, my friend," said Hitt."For to such
crude beliefs as this we may attribute all the miseries of mankind.""Simply because these beliefs constitute the general belief in a
universe of matter without and about us.As a plain statement of fact,
_there is no such thing_.But, I ask again, Is the mind within the
brain, waiting for vibrations that will give it information concerning
the external world?Or does the mind, from some focal point without
the brain, look first at these vibrations, and then translate them
into terms of things without?Do these vibrations in some way suggest
form and color and substance to the waiting mind?Does the mind first
look at vibrating nerve-points, and then form its own opinions
regarding material objects?"No," admitted the doctor; "unless we believe that vibrations _per se_
are material.""Now I ask, Is the mind reduced to such slavery that it must depend
upon vibrations for its knowledge of an outside world?""And vibrations of minute pieces of flesh, at that!Flesh that
will some day decay and leave the mind helpless!""Why doesn't the mind look directly at
the chair, instead of getting its knowledge of the chair through
vibrations of bits of meat?Or isn't there any chair out there to look
at?""Now you've put your mental finger upon it.And now we are ready to nail to the cross of ignominy one of the
crudest, most insensate beliefs of the human race._The human mind
gets nothing whatsoever from vibrations, from the human, fleshly eye,
nor from any one of the five so-called physical senses!_ The physical
sense-testimony which mankind believe they receive from the eyes, the
ears, and the other sense organs, can, even at best, consist only of a
lot of disconnected, unintelligible vibrations; and anything that the
mind may infer from such vibrations is inferred _without any outside
authority whatsoever!ejaculated Miss Wall and Haynerd in a breath."And, further," continued Hitt, "we are forced to admit that all that
the mind knows is the contents of itself, of its own consciousness,
and nothing more.Then, instead of seeing, hearing, and feeling real
material objects outside of ourselves, we are in reality seeing,
hearing, and feeling our own mental concepts of things--in other
words, _our own thoughts of things!"_

A deep silence lay for some moments over the little group at the
conclusion of Hitt's words.Then Doctor Morton nodded his acquiescence
in the deduction."And that," he said, "effectually disposes of the
question of space.""There is no space, Doctor," replied Hitt.The human mind sees, hears, and feels nothing but its own
thoughts.These it posits within itself with reference to one another,
and calls the process'seeing material objects in space.'The mind as
little needs a space in which to see things as in which to dream them.I repeat, we do not see external things, or things outside of
ourselves.We see always and only the thoughts that are within our own
mentalities."That's why," murmured Carmen, "Jesus said, 'The kingdom of heaven is
within you.'""Did he not call evil, and all that originates
in matter, the lie about God?I tell you,
the existence of a world outside of ourselves, an objective world
composed of matter, is wholly inferred--it is mental visualizing--and
it is unreal, for it is not based upon fact, upon truth!""Then," queried Haynerd, "our supposed 'outer world' is but our
collection of thought-concepts which we hold within us, within our own
consciousness, eh?""We are ready for that again," replied Hitt."We have said that in the
physical universe all is in a state of incessant change.Since the
physical universe is but a mental concept to each one of us, we must
admit that, were the concept based upon truth, it would not change.Our concept of the universe must be without the real causative and
sustaining principle of all reality, else would it not pass away.And
yet, beneath and behind all these changes, _something_ endures.There is an enduring substance, invisible to human
sight, but felt and known through its own influence.But none of these things is in any sense
material.The material is the fleeting, human concept, composed of
thought that is _not_ based upon reality.These other things, wholly
mental, or spiritual, if you prefer, are based upon that'something'
which does endure, and which I will call the Causative Principle."I think," interposed Doctor Morton at this juncture, "that I can
throw some light upon the immaterial character of matter, if I may so
put it; for even our physical reasoning throws it entirely into the
realm of the mental."The doctor sat for some moments in a deep study.Then he began:

"The constitution of matter, speaking now from an admittedly
materialistic standpoint, that of the physical sciences, is a subject
of vastest interest and importance to mankind, for human existence
_is_ material."The ultimate constituent of matter has been called the atom.But we
have said little when we have said that.The atom was once defined as
a particle of matter so minute as to admit of no further division.That definition has gone to the rubbish heap, for the atom can now be
torn to pieces.But--and here is the revolutionary fact in modern
physical science--_it is no longer held necessary that matter should
consist of material particles!_ In fact, the great potential discovery
of our day is that matter is electrical in composition, that it is
composed of what are called 'electrons,' and that these electrons are
themselves composed of electric charges.It is without weight, bulk, dimensions, or
tangibility.Well, then, it comes dangerously near being a mental
thing, known to the human mind solely by its manifestations, does it
not?And of course our comprehension of it is entirely mental, as is
our comprehension of everything."He paused for a moment, that his words might be fully grasped.Then he
went on:

"Now these atoms, whatever they are, are supposed to join together to
form molecules.Why, it is--well, law, if you please.Then, going a step further,
molecules are held together by cohesion to form material objects,
chairs, trees, coal, and the like."But, Doctor--" interrupted Haynerd."Now we
have the very latest word from our physical scientists regarding the
constitution of matter: _it is composed of electric charges, held
together by law._ Again, you may justly ask: Is matter material--or
mental?"He paused again, and took up a book that lay before him."Here," he continued, "I hold a solid, material, lumpy thing,
composed, you will say, of matter.And yet, in essence, and if we can
believe our scientists, this book is composed of billions of electric
charges--invisible things, without form, without weight, without
color, without extension, held together by law, and making up a
material object which has mass, color, weight, and extension.From
millions of things which are invisible and have no size, we get an
object, visible and extended.""Yet, the doctor is giving the very latest
deductions of the great scientists.""But, Doctor," said Father Waite, "the scientists tell us that they
have experimental evidence in support of the theories which you have
stated regarding the composition of matter.Electricity has been
proven granular, or atomic, in structure.And every electrical
charge consists of an exact number of electrical atoms spread out
over the surface of the charged body."Admitted," said Hitt, taking up the challenge."And their very
calculations and deductions are rapidly wearing away the'materialistic
theory' of matter.You will admit that mathematics is wholly
confined to the realm of mind.It is a strictly mental science, in no
way material.It loses definiteness when 'practically' applied to
material objects.Kant saw this, and declared that a science might be
regarded as further removed from or nearer to perfection in proportion
to the amount of mathematics it contained.Now there has been an
astonishing confirmation of this great truth just lately.At a banquet
given in honor of the discoverer of wireless telegraphy it was stated
that the laws governing the traversing of space by the invisible
electric waves were more exact than the general laws of physics,
where very complex formulas and coefficients are required for
correcting the general laws, due to surrounding material conditions.The greater exactness of laws governing the invisible electric waves
was said to be due to the absence of matter.And it was further
stated that _whenever matter had to be taken into consideration there
could be no exact law of action!"That matter admits of no definite laws," replied Hitt."That there
are no real laws of matter.And that definiteness is attained only as
we dematerialize matter itself.""In other words, get into the realm of the mental?"I have said that we do not
receive any testimony whatsoever through the so-called material
senses, but that we see, hear, feel, taste, and smell our own
thoughts--that is, the thoughts which, from some source, come into our
mentalities.Very well, our scientists show us that, as they get
farther away from dense material thoughts, and deal more and more with
those which have less material structure, less material composition,
their laws become more definite, more exact.Following this out to its
ultimate conclusion, we may say, then, that _only those laws which
have to do with the non-material are perfect_.""And those," said Carmen, "are the laws of mind."And now the history of physical science shows that there has
been a constant deviation from the old so-called fixed 'laws of
matter.'The law of impenetrability has had to go.A great physicist
tells us that, when dealing with sufficiently high speeds, matter has
no such property as impenetrability.The law of indestructibility has had to go.Matter deteriorates and
goes to pieces.The decided
tendency of belief is toward a single element, of which all matter is
composed, and of which the eighty-odd constituent elements of matter
accepted to-day are but modifications.That unit element may be the
ether, of course.And the great Russian chemist, Mendeleef, so
believed.But to us, the ether is a mental thing, a theory.But,
granting its existence, _its universal penetrability renders matter,
as we know it, non-existent_.Everything reduces to the ether, in the
final analysis.And all energy becomes vibrations in and of the
ether.""And the ether," supplemented the doctor, "has to be without mass,
invisible, tasteless, intangible, much more rigid than steel, and at
the same time some six hundred billion times lighter than air, in
order to fulfill all the requirements made of it and to meet all
conditions.""Yes; and yet the ether is a very necessary theory, if we are going to
continue to explain the phenomena of force on a material basis.""Then," said Carmen, "matter reduces to what it really is, the human
mind's _interpretation_ of substance.""Yes," said Hitt, turning to her; "I think you are right; matter is
the way real substance--let us say, spirit--looks to the human
mentality.It is the way the human mind interprets its ideas of
spirit.In other words, the human mind looks at the material thoughts
and ideas which enter it, and calls them solid substance, occupying
space--calls them matter, with definite laws, and, in certain forms,
containing life and intelligence.""And that has been the terrible
mistake of the ages, the one great error, the one lie, that has caused
us all to miss the mark and come short, far short, of the glory of the
mind that is God._There is the origin of the problem of evil!_"

"Undoubtedly," replied Hitt."For evil is in essence but evil thought.The origin of
all evil is matter itself.And matter, we find, is but a mental
concept, a thing of thought."Well," put in Haynerd, who had been twitching nervously in his chair,
"let's get to the conclusion of this very learned discussion.I'm a
plain man, and I'd like to know just where we've landed.What have you
said that I can take home with me?The earth still revolves around the
sun, even if it is a mean mud ball.And I can't see that I can get
along with less than three square meals a day.""We have arrived," replied Hitt gravely, "at a most momentous
conclusion, deduced by the physical scientists themselves, namely,
that _things are not what they seem_.In other words, all things
material seem to reduce to vibrations in and of the ether; the basis
of all materiality is energy, motion, activity--mental things.All the
elements of matter seem to be but modifications of one all-pervading
element.That element is probably the ether, often called the'mother
of matter.'The elements, such as carbon, silicon, and the others, are
not elementary at all, but are forms of one universal element, the
ether.The so-called rare elements are
rare only because their lives are short.They disintegrate rapidly and
change into other forms of the universal element--or disappear.'Atoms
are but fleeting phases of matter,' we are told.They are by no means
eternal, even though they may endure for millions of years.""A great scientist of our own day," Hitt continued, "has said that
'the ether is so modified as to constitute matter, in some way.'Simply that 'visible matter and invisible ether are
one and the same thing.'But to the five so-called physical senses the
ether is utterly incomprehensible.So, then, matter is wholly
incomprehensible to the five physical senses.What is it, then, that
we call matter?It can be nothing more than the human mind's
interpretation of its idea of an all-pervading, omnipresent
_something_, a something which represents substance to it.""Let me add a further quotation from the great physical scientist to
whom you have referred," said the doctor."He has said that the ether
is _not_ matter, but that it is material.And further, that we can not
deny that the ether may have some mental and spiritual functions to
subserve in some other order of existence, as matter has in this.It
is wholly unrelated to any of our senses.The sense of sight takes
cognizance of it, but only in a very indirect and not easily
recognized way.And yet--stupendous conclusion!--_without the ether
there could be no material universe at all_!""In other words," said Hitt, "the whole fabric of the material
universe depends upon something utterly unrecognizable by the five
physical senses.""Then," concluded Hitt, "the physical senses give us no information
whatsoever of a real physical universe about us.""And so," added Father Waite, "we come back to Carmen's statement,
namely, that seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling are
mental processes, in no way dependent upon the outer fleshly organs of
sense--"

"Nonsense!""Why is it, then, that if the eyes
are destroyed we do not see?""Simply, my friend, because of human belief," replied Hitt."The human
mind has been trained for untold centuries to dependence upon beliefs
in the reality of matter, and beliefs in its dependence upon material
modes for sight, hearing, touch, and so on.It is because of its
erroneous beliefs that the human mind is to-day enslaved by matter,
and dependent upon it for its very sense of existence.The human mind
has made its sense of sight dependent upon a frail, pulpy bit of
flesh, the eye.As long as that fleshly organ remains intact, the
human mind sees its sense of sight externalized in the positing of its
mental concepts about it as natural objects.But let that fleshly eye
be destroyed, and the human mind sees its belief of dependence upon
the material eye externalized as blindness.When the fleshly eye is
gone the mind declares that it can no longer see.And what it declares
as truth, as fact, becomes externalized to it.I repeat, the human
mind sees and hears only its thoughts, its beliefs.And holding to
these beliefs, and making them real to itself, it eventually sees them
externalized in what it calls its outer world, its environment, its
universe.And yet, the materialistic scientists themselves show that
the human mind can take no cognizance whatever through the five
physical senses of the all-pervading basis of its very existence, the
ether.it is but a theory which we find necessary
for any intelligible explanation of the farce of human existence on a
material basis."retorted Haynerd, rising and giving expression to his
protest by means of emphatic gestures.You
tell me that the existence of things demands a creator, and I admit
it, for there can be no effect without a cause.Then you say that the
universe is infinite; and I admit that, too, for the science of
astronomy finds no limits to space, and no space unoccupied.You say
that the unity manifested in the universe proves that there can be but
one creator.Moreover, to create an infinite universe there must needs
be an omnipotent creator; and there can be but one who is omnipotent.Further, I can see how that creator must be
mind--infinite mind.And I can see why that mind must be absolutely
perfect, with no intelligence of evil whatsoever, else would it be a
house divided against itself.Now I admit that the universe must be the manifestation, the
expression, of that infinite creative mind.But--and here's the
sticking point--the universe is both good and evil!Hence, the mind
which it manifests is likewise both good and evil--and the whole
pretty theory blows up!"He sat down abruptly, with the air of having given finality to a
perplexing question.All eyes then turned to Carmen, who slowly rose and surveyed the
little group."It is not surprising," she said, smiling at the confused Haynerd,
"that difficulties arise when you attempt to reach God through human
reasoning--spirit through matter.You have taken the unreal, and,
through it, have sought to reach back to the real.""Well," interrupted Haynerd testily, "kindly explain the difference.""Then, first," replied Carmen, "let us adopt some common meeting
ground, some basis which we can all accept, and from which we can
rise.Are you all agreed that, in our every-day life, everything is
mental?--every action?--every object?--and that, as the philosopher
Mill said, 'Everything is a feeling of which the mind is conscious'?Let me illustrate my meaning," she continued, noting Haynerd's rising
protest."I see this book; I take it up; and drop it upon the table.No; I have been conscious of thoughts which
I call a book, nothing more.A real material book did not get into my
mind; but _thoughts_ of a book did.And the activity of such thought
resulted in a state of consciousness--for consciousness is mental
activity, the activity of thought.Remember that, even according to
your great physical scientists, this book is composed of millions of
charges of electricity, or electrons, moving at a tremendously high
rate of speed.And yet, regardless of its composition, I am conscious
only of my thoughts of the book.It is but my thoughts that I see,
after all."She paused and waited for the protest which was not voiced."Very well," she said, continuing; "so it is with the sense of touch;
I had the thought of touching it, and that thought I saw; I was
conscious of it when it became active in my mentality.So with sound;
when I let the book drop, I was conscious of my thought of sound.If
the book had been dropped in a vacuum I should not have been conscious
of a thought of sound--why?Hitt has told us, the
human mind has made its sense-testimony dependent upon vibrations.And
yet, there is a clock ticking up there on the wall."Yes," replied Haynerd; "now that you've called my attention to it.""You hear it when your thought is
directed to it.And yet the air was vibrating all the time, and, if
hearing is dependent upon the fleshly ear, you should have heard it
incessantly when you were not thinking of it, as well as you hear it
now when you are thinking of it."Well, perhaps so," assented Haynerd with some reluctance."We hear, see, and feel," continued the girl, "when our thought is
directed to these processes.And the processes are wholly mental--they
take place within our mentalities--and it is there, within our minds,
that we see, hear, and feel _all_ things.And it is there, within our
minds, that the universe exists for us.It is there that we hold our
world, our fleshly bodies, everything that we call material._The
universe that we think we see all about us consists of the mental
concepts, made up of thought, which we hold within our mentalities_."Carmen proceeded with the
exposition of her theme."Whence come these material thoughts that are within us?They are real to us, at any rate,
are they not?And if they are thoughts of pain and suffering and
death, they are terribly real to us.But let us see, now that we can
reason from the basis of the mental nature of all things.We have
agreed that the creative principle is mind, and we call it God.This
infinite mind constantly expresses and manifests itself in ideas.Why,
that is a fundamental law of mind!You express yourself in your ideas
and thoughts, which you try to externalize materially.But the
infinite mind expresses itself in an infinite number and variety of
ideas, all, like itself, pure, perfect, eternal, good, without any
elements or seeds of decay or discord.And the incessant expression of
the creative mind in and through its numberless ideas constitutes the
never-ending process of creation.""Let me add here," interrupted Hitt, "that the Bible states that God
created the heavens and earth in seven days.But numbers, we must
remember, were mystical things to the ancient Hebrews, and were
largely used symbolically.The number seven, for example, was used to
express wholeness, completeness.So we must remember that its use in
Genesis has a much wider meaning than its absurd theological
interpretation into seven solar days.As Carmen says, the infinite
creative mind can never cease to express itself; creation can never
cease; and creation is but the whole, complete revelation or
unfoldment of infinite mind's ideas.""And infinite mind," continued Carmen, "requires infinite time in
which to completely express itself.So time ceases to be, and we find
that all real things exist now, in an endless present.Now, the ideas
of infinite mind range throughout the realm of infinity, but the
greatest idea that the creative mind can have is the idea of itself.That idea is the image and likeness of the infinite creative mind.It
is the perfect reflection of that mind--its perfect expression.That
idea is what the man Jesus always saw back of the human concept of
man."That's quite a different proposition from
the mud-men that I do business with daily."If they were real," said Carmen, "they would have to be children of
God.But then they would not be'mud-men.'Now I have just spoken of
the real, the spiritual creation.That is the creation mentioned in
the first chapter of Genesis, where all was created--revealed,
unfolded--by God, and He saw that it was perfect, good.'In the
beginning,' says the commentator.That is, 'To begin with--God.'Everything begins with God in the realm of the real.And the creation, or unfoldment, is like its creative
principle, eternal and good.""But," persisted Haynerd, "how about the material man?""Having created all things spiritually," continued the girl, "was it
necessary that the creative mind should repeat its work, do it over
again, and produce the man of dust described in the second chapter of
Genesis?Is that second account of the creation an inspiration of
truth--or a human comment?""Call it what you will," said the cynical Haynerd; "the fact remains
that the mud-man exists and has to be reckoned with.""Both of your premises are wholly incorrect," returned the girl
gently."He does _not_ exist, excepting in human, mortal thought.He
is a product of only such thought.He and his material universe are
seen and dealt with only in such thought.And such thought is the
direct antithesis of God's thought.It is
the supposition, the lie, the mist that went up and darkened the
earth.""Is just what you have said, a hue of a man, a dark hue, the shadowy
opposite which seems to counterfeit the real, spiritual man and claim
all his attributes.He is not a compound of mind and matter, for we
have seen that all things are mental, even matter itself.He is a sort
of mentality, a counterfeit of real mind.His body and his universe
are in himself.And, like all that is unreal, he is transient,
passing, ephemeral, mortal.""No, for he does not exist, excepting in supposition.If so, then not even truth can destroy it.No, the human mind is the
'old man' of Paul.He is to be put off by knowing his nothingness, and
by knowing the unreality of his supposed material environment and
universe.As he goes out of consciousness, the real man, the idea of
God, perfect, harmonious, and eternal, comes in.""And there," said Father Waite impressively, "you have the whole
scheme of salvation, as enunciated by the man Jesus.""There is no doubt of it," added Hitt.how
futile, how base, how worse than childish now appear the whole
theological fabric of the churches, their foolish man-made dogmas,
their insensate beliefs in a fiery hell and a golden heaven.Oh, how
belittling now appear their concepts of God--a God who can damn
unbaptised infants, who can predestine his children to eternal sorrow,
who creates and then curses his handiwork!Do you wonder that sin,
sorrow, and death remain among us while such awful beliefs hold sway
over the human mind?Haynerd, who had been sitting quietly for some moments, deep in
thought, rose and held out his hands, as if in entreaty.It seems--it seems as if a curtain had been raised suddenly.And what I
see beyond is--"

Carmen went swiftly to the man and slipped an arm about him."That
infinite creative Mind, so misunderstood and misinterpreted by human
beings, is back of you," she whispered."But had I not seen the proof in you, no amount of reasoning would
have convinced me."And, bowing to the little group, he went out.said Hitt, turning inquiringly to the doctor."If these things are true," he made answer
slowly, "then I shall have to recast my entire mentality, my whole
basis of thinking.""It is just what you _must_ do, Doctor, if you would work out your
salvation," said Carmen."Jesus said we must repent if we would be
saved.Repentance--the Greek _metanoia_--means a complete and radical
change of thought.""But--do you mean to say that the whole world has been mistaken?That
the entire human race has been deceived for ages?""Why," said Hitt, "it was only in our own day, comparatively speaking,
that the human race was undeceived in regard to the world being round.And there are thousands of human beings to-day who still believe in
witchcraft, and who worship the sun and moon, and whose lives are
wholly under the spell of superstition.Human character, a great
scientist tells us, has not changed since history began.""But we can't revamp our thought-processes!""Then we must go on missing the mark, sinning, suffering, sorrowing,
and dying, over and over and over again, until we decide that we can
do so," said Hitt.The doctor looked at Carmen and met that same smile of unbounded love
which she gave without stint to a sin-weary world."I--I'll come again," he said."Yes," said Carmen, rising and coming around to him."And," in a
whisper, "bring Pat."CHAPTER 6


The Social Era had for many years made its weekly appearance every
Saturday morning, that its fashionable clientele might appease their
jaded appetites on the Sabbath day by nibbling at its spicy pabulum.But, though the Ames reception had fallen on a Saturday night, the
following Friday morning found the columns of the Era still awaiting
a report of the notable affair.Whenever he set his pen to the task, there loomed before him only the
scene in the little waiting room, and he could write of nothing else.He found himself still dwelling upon the awful contrast between the
slender wisp of a girl and her mountainous opponent, as they had stood
before him; and the terrifying thoughts of what was sure to follow in
consequence drenched his skin with cold perspiration.On the desk before him lay the essay which he had asked Carmen to
write during the week, as her report of the brilliant event.He had
read it through three times, and each time had read into it a new
meaning.Not that it ridiculed or condemned--at
least, not openly--but because every one of its crisp comments
admitted of an interpretation which revealed the hidden depths of the
social system, and its gigantic incarnation, as if under the glare of
a powerful searchlight.It was in no sense a muck-raking exposition.Rather, it was an interpretation, and a suggestion.It was, too, a
prediction; but not a curse.The girl loved those about whom she
wrote.And yet, he who read the essay aright would learn that her love
stopped not at the flimsy veil of the flesh, but penetrated until it
rested upon the fair spiritual image beyond.And then Haynerd saw that
the essay was, in substance, a social clinic, to which all searchers
after truth were bidden, that they might learn a great lesson from her
skillful dissection of the human mind, and her keen analysis of its
constituent thought.As he sat wrapped in reflection, the early morning mail was brought
in.He glanced up, and then started to his feet.The letters spread
over his desk like an avalanche of snow; and the puffing mail carrier
declared that he had made a special trip with them alone.Haynerd
began to tear them open, one after another.Then he called the office
boy, and set him at the task.There were more than five hundred of
them, and each contained a canceled subscription to the Social Era.A dark foreboding settled down over Haynerd's mind.He rose and went
to the card-index to consult his subscription list.He
stood confusedly for a moment, then hastened to the window that looked
out upon a fire-escape.He turned
and rushed to the vault, which, reflecting his own habitual
carelessness, was never locked.His ledgers and account books were not
there.Then he crept back to his desk and sank into a chair.The noon mail brought more letters of like nature, until the office
boy tallied nearly eight hundred.Then Haynerd, as if rousing from a
dream, reached for the telephone and summoned Hitt to his rescue.Its mailing list had contained some
fifteen hundred names.The subscription price was twelve dollars a
year--and never, to his knowledge, had it been paid in advance by his
ultra-rich patrons, most of whom were greatly in arrears.Haynerd saw
it all vanishing now as quietly as the mist fades before the summer
sun.Within an hour the wondering Hitt was in conference with him, and
Haynerd had told the story of the theft, of the Ames bribe, and the
encounter following."But," he cried, "can Ames kill my entire
subscription list, and in a single week?""Easily," replied Hitt, "and in any one of several ways.Apparently he
had caused your subscription list and books to be stolen.Or, rather, Ames has lifted it bodily from the sky."Carmen
and I saw him bribe Wales!"Forget all that," he said, laying a hand on the excited
man's arm."Remember, that Wales would never dare breathe a word of
it; Carmen has no reputation or standing whatsoever now in this city;
and Ames would make out a case of blackmail against you so quickly
that it would sweep you right into the Tombs.And first, let
us get the girl herself down here."He took the telephone and called up several of the University
departments, after first ascertaining that she was not at her home.Then, having located her, he plunged into a study of the situation
with the distracted publisher."Here I waste my
evenings in learned philosophical discussions with you people, and
meantime, while we're figuring out that there is no evil, that
monster, Ames, stretches out a tentacle and strangles me!Fine
practical discussions we've been having, ain't they?I tell you, I'm
through with 'em!"He brought his fist down upon the desk with a
crash."Ned," said Hitt, "you're a fool."Here I had a nice, clean
business, no work, good pay--and, just because I associated with you
and that girl, the whole damn thing goes up the flue!Pays to be good,
doesn't it?"H'm; well, Ned, you're not only a fool, but a blooming idiot,"
replied Hitt calmly."And if you run out of
epithets, I'll supply a few!I'm a--"

The door swung open, and Carmen entered, fresh as the sea breeze, and
panting with her haste."Do you know," she began eagerly, "two men
followed me all the way down from the University!They watched me
come in here, and--but, what is wrong with you two?"She stopped and
looked inquiringly from one to the other."Well," began Hitt hesitatingly, "we were reflecting--"

"Reflecting?"We were just holding a wake, that's all," muttered Haynerd.Hitt pushed out a chair for the girl, and bade her sit down.Then he
briefly related the events which had led to her being summoned."And
now," he concluded, "the question is, does Wales know that you and Ned
saw Ames try to bribe him?""I did--last Monday morning, early," answered the wondering girl.ejaculated Haynerd, turning upon Hitt and waving
his arms about."What do you--"

"Hold your tongue, Ned!"Then, to Carmen, "Why did
you tell her?""Why--to save her, and her husband, and babies!"But, to save them, you have ruined Ned," pursued Hitt.The girl turned to Haynerd, who sat doubled up in his chair, the
picture of despair.It was the first time
she had used this name in addressing him.And if you have been pushed out of this business, it is because
it isn't fit for you, and because you've been awakened.You are for
higher, better things than the publishing of such a magazine as the
Social Era.I knew you just couldn't stay at this work.You have got
to go up--"

"Eh!"Haynerd had roused out of his torpor.Yes, I've gone up,
nicely!And I was making ten thousand dollars a year out of it!"I wasn't speaking of money," she said."When I talk, it's in dollars and
cents!""And that's why your talk is mostly nonsense," put in Hitt."The
girl's right, I guess.You've stagnated here long enough, Ned.There's
no such thing as standing still."You now have a grand opportunity," said Carmen, taking his hand."Yes; every trial in this life is an opportunity to prove that there
is no evil," she said."Listen; you have been trained as a publisher.Very well, the world is waiting for the right kind of publications.Oh, I've seen it for a long, long time.The demand is simply
tremendous.Haynerd looked confusedly from Carmen to Hitt."What, exactly, do you mean, Carmen?""Let him publish now a clean magazine, or paper; let him print real
news; let him work, not for rich people's money, but for all people.Why, the press is the greatest educator in the world!But, oh, how it
has been abused!Now let him come out boldly and stand for clean
journalism.Let him find his own life, his own good, in service for
others.""But, Carmen," protested Hitt, "do the people want clean journalism?"It could, if it had the right thought back of it," returned the
confident girl.Haynerd had again lapsed into sulky silence.But Hitt pondered the
girl's words for some moments.She was not the first nor the only one
who had voiced such sentiments.He himself had even dared to hold the
same thoughts, and to read in them a leading that came not from
material ambitions.Then, of a sudden, an idea flamed up in his mind.Hitt's eyes widened with his expanding
thought."Carlson, editor of the Express, wants to sell," he
continued, speaking rapidly."It's a semi-weekly newspaper, printed only for country circulation;
has no subscription list," commented Haynerd, with a cynical shrug of
his shoulders.The abruptness of the strange, apparently irrelevant question
startled the girl."Why," she replied slowly, "as old as--as God."And, as human beings reckon time, eighteen, eh?"Hitt then turned to
Haynerd."How much money can you scrape together, if you sell this lot
of junk?"he asked, sweeping the place with a glance."Five or six thousand, all told, including bank account, bonds, and
everything, I suppose," replied Haynerd mechanically."Carlson wants forty thousand for the Express.I'm not a rich man, as
wealth is estimated to-day, but--well, oil is still flowing down in
Ohio.It isn't the money--it's--it's what's back of the cash."Carmen reached over and laid a hand on his arm."We can do it," she
whispered.Hitt hesitated a moment longer, then sprang to his feet."I've pondered and studied this scheme for a year,
but I've only to-day seen the right help.That is your tremendous,
driving thought," he said, turning to Carmen."That thought is a
spiritual dynamite, that will blast its way through every material
obstacle!Ned," seizing Haynerd by the shoulder and shaking him out of
his chair, "rouse up!Now I'll 'phone Carlson
right away and make an appointment to talk business with him.Haynerd blinked for a few moments, like an owl in the light.But then,
as a comprehension of Hitt's plan dawned upon his waking thought, he
straightened up.The clientele of the Express will not be made up
of his puppets!"But--your University work, Hitt?""I was only biding my time," she replied gently.Tears began to trickle slowly down Haynerd's cheeks, as the tension in
his nerves slackened.He rose and seized the hands of his two friends."Hitt," he said, in a choking voice, "I--I said I was a fool.The real man has waked up, and--well, what are you
standing there for, you great idiot?*       *       *       *       *

Again that evening the little group sat about the table in the dining
room of the Beaubien cottage.But only the three most directly
concerned, and the Beaubien, knew that the owner of the Express had
received that afternoon an offer for the purchase of his newspaper,
and that he had been given twenty-four hours in which to accept it.Doctor Morton was again present; and beside him sat his lifelong
friend and jousting-mate, the very Reverend Patterson Moore.Hitt
took the floor, and began speaking low and earnestly."We must remember," he said, "in conjunction with what we have deduced
regarding the infinite creative mind and its manifestations, that we
mortals in our daily mundane existence deal only and always with
phenomena, with appearances, with effects, and never with ultimate
causes.And so all our material knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only.Of the ultimate essence of things, the human mind
knows nothing.A phenomenon may be
so-and-so with regard to another; but that either is absolute truth we
can not affirm.And yet--mark this well--as Spencer says, 'Every one
of the arguments by which the relativity of our knowledge is
demonstrated distinctly postulates the positive existence of something
beyond the relative.'""It is a primitive statement of what is sometimes called the 'Theory
of suppositional opposites'", replied Hitt."It means that to every
reality there is the corresponding unreality.For every truth there
may be postulated the supposition.We can not, as the great
philosopher says, conceive that our knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only, without at the same time conceiving a reality of
which they are appearances.He further amplifies this by saying that
'every positive notion--the concept of a thing by what it is--suggests
a negative notion--the concept of a thing by what it is not.But,
though these mutually suggest each other, _the positive alone is
real_.'For, interpreted, it means: we
must deny the seeming, or that which appears to human sense, in order
to see that which is real."exclaimed Miss Wall, glancing about to note the
effect of the speaker's words on the others.But Carmen nodded her thorough agreement, and added: "Did not Jesus
say that we must deny ourselves?Why, the self that
appears to us, the matter-man, the dust-man, the man of the second
chapter of Genesis.We must deny his reality, and know that he is
nothing but a mental concept, formed out of suppositional thought, out
of dust-thought."Undoubtedly correct," said Hitt, turning to Carmen."But, before we
consider the astonishing teachings of Jesus, let us sum up the
conclusions of philosophy.To begin with, then, there is a First
Cause, omnipotent and omnipresent, and of very necessity perfect.That
Cause lies back of all the phenomena of life; and, because of its real
existence, there arises the suppositional existence of its opposite,
its negative, so to speak, which is unreal.The phenomena of human
existence have to do _only_ with the suppositional existence of the
great First Cause's opposite.They are a reflection of that
supposition.Hence all human knowledge of an external world is but
phenomenal, and consists of appearances which have no more real
substance than have shadows._We, as mortals, know but the shadowy,
phenomenal existence._ _We do not know reality._ _Therefore, our
knowledge is not real knowledge, but supposition._

"Now," he went on hastily, for he saw an expression of protest on
Reverend Moore's face, "we are more or less familiar with a phenomenal
existence, with appearances, with effects; and our knowledge of these
is entirely mental.These thoughts, such
as feeling, seeing, hearing, and so on, we ignorantly attribute to the
five physical senses.This is what Ruskin calls the 'pathetic
fallacy.'And because we do so, we find ourselves absolutely dependent
upon these senses--in belief.Moreover, quoting Spencer again, only
the absolutely real is the absolutely persistent, or enduring.The truth of the multiplication table will endure
eternally."No," admitted Miss Wall, speaking for the others."And, as regards material objects which we seem to see and touch,"
went on Hitt, "we appear to see solidity and hardness, and we conceive
as real objects what are only the mental signs or indications of
objects.Remember, matter does not and can not get into the mind.Only
thoughts and ideas enter our mentalities.We see our _thoughts_ of
hardness, solidity, and so on; and these thoughts point to something
that is real.I repeat: _the ideas of the
infinite creative Mind_.The thoughts of size, shape, hardness, and so
on, which we group together and call material chairs, trees,
mountains, and other objects, are but'relative realities,' pointing
to the absolute reality, infinite mind and its eternal ideas and
thoughts."But all seemed absorbed in his
statements.Then he resumed:

"Our concept of matter, which is now proven to be but a mental
concept, built up out of false thought, points to _mind_ as the real
substance.Our concept of measurable space and distance is the direct
opposite of the great truth that infinite mind is ever-present.Our
concept of time is the opposite of infinity.Age is the opposite of eternity--and the old-age thought
brings extinction.So, _to every reality there is the corresponding
unreality_.If the infinite creative
mind is good--and we saw that by very necessity it _must_ be so--then
evil becomes an awful unreality, and is real only to the false thought
which entertains or holds it.If life is real--and infinite mind must
itself be life--then death becomes the opposite unreality.And, as
Jesus said, it can be overcome.But were it real, _no power_, _divine
or human_, _could ever overcome or destroy it_!""Seems to me," remarked Haynerd dryly, "that our study so far simply
goes to show, as Burke puts it, 'what shadows we are and what shadows
we pursue.'""When the world humiliates itself to the point that it
will accept that, my friend," he said, "then it will become receptive
to truth."But now let us go a little further," he went on."The great Lamarck
voiced a mighty fact when he said, 'Function precedes structure.'For
by that we mean that the egg did not produce the bird, but the bird
the egg.The world seems about to pass from the very foolish belief
that physical structure is the cause of life, to the great fact that a
_sense_ of life produces the physical structure.The former crude
belief enslaved man to his body.The latter tends to free him from
such slavery.""You see, Doctor," interrupted Carmen, "the brain which you were
cutting up the other day did not make poor Yorick's mind and thought,
but his mind made the brain."The doctor smiled and shook a warning finger at the girl."The body," resumed Hitt, "is a manifestation of the human mind's
activity.What constitutes the difference between a bird and a steam
engine?This, in part: the engine is made by human hands from without;
the bird makes itself, that is, its body, from within.But the ignorant human mind--ignorant _per se_--falls
a slave to its own creation, the mental concept which it calls its
physical body, and which it pampers and pets and loves, until it can
cling to it no longer, because the mental concept, not being based on
any real principle, is forced to pass away, having nothing but false
thought to sustain it.""But now," interposed Haynerd, who was again waxing impatient, "just
what is the practical application of all this abstruse reasoning?""The very greatest imaginable, my friend," replied Hitt.And so matter can not become non-existent _unless it
is already nothing_!The world is beginning to recognize the
tremendous fact that from nothing nothing can be made.Very well,
since the law of the conservation of energy seems to be established as
regards energy _in toto_, why, we must conclude that there is no such
thing as _annihilation_.And that means that _there is no such thing
as absolute creation_!The shadow
never was real, and does not exist.And so creation becomes unfolding,
or revelation, or development, of what already exists, and has always
existed, and always will exist.Therefore, if matter, and all it
includes as concomitants, evil, sin, sickness, accident, chance, lack,
and death, is based upon unreal, false thought, then it can all be
removed, put out of consciousness, by a knowledge of truth and a
reversal of our accustomed human thought-processes.""And that," said Carmen, "is salvation.It is based on righteousness,
which is right-thinking, thinking true thoughts, and thinking truly.""And knowing," added Hitt, "that evil, including matter, is the
suppositional opposite of truth.The doctrine of materialism has been
utterly disproved even by the physicists themselves.For physicists
have at last agreed that inertia is the great essential property of
matter.That is, matter is not a cause, but an effect.It does not
operate, but is operated upon.It is not a law-giver, but is subject
to the human mind's so-called laws concerning it.It of itself is
utterly without life or intelligence."Now Spencer said that matter was a
manifestation of an underlying power or force.Physicists tell us that
matter is made of electricity, that it is an electrical phenomenon,
and that the ultimate constituent of matter is the electron.The
electron is said by some to be made up of superimposed layers of
positive and negative electricity, and by others to be made up of only
negative charges.I rather prefer the latter view, for if composed of
only negative electricity it is more truly a negation.Matter is the
_negative_ of real substance.Hence matter is a form of
energy also.But our comprehension of it is _wholly mental_.The only real energy there is or can be is the energy of the
infinite mind we call God.This the human mind copies, or imitates,
by reason of what has been called 'the law of suppositional
opposites,' already dwelt upon at some length.Gravitation is regarded by some physicists as the negative aspect of
radiation-pressure, the latter being the pressure supposed to be
exerted by all material bodies upon one another.The third law of
motion illustrates this so-called law, for it states that action
and reaction are equal and opposite.There can be no positive action
without a resultant negative one.The divine
mind, God, has His opposite in the communal human, or mortal, mind.The latter is manifested by the so-called minds which we call mankind.And from these so-called minds issue matter and material forms and
bodies, with their so-called material laws."Yes, the material universe is running down.The
entire human concept is running down.Matter, the human mental
concept, is not eternally permanent.Neither, therefore, are its
concomitants, sin and discord.Matter disintegrates and passes
away--out of human consciousness.The whole material universe--the
so-called mortal-mind concept--is hastening to its death!""But as yet I think you have not given Mr.Haynerd the practical
application which he asks," suggested Father Waite, as Hitt paused
after his long exposition."I am now ready for that," replied Hitt."We have said that the
material is the relative.But,
that being so, we can go a step further and add that human error is
likewise relative.And now--startling fact!--_it is absolutely
impossible to really know error_!""Can you know that two plus two
equals seven?""Let me make this statement of truth: nothing can be known definitely
except as it is explained by the principle which governs it.Now what
principle governs an error, whether that error be in music,
mathematics, or life conduct?"And that
is why God--infinite Mind--can not behold evil.And now, friends, I
have come to the conclusion of a long series of deductions.If
infinite mind is the cause and creator, that is, the revealer, of all
that really exists, its suppositional opposite, its negative, must
likewise simulate a creation, or revelation, or unfolding, for this
opposite must of very necessity pose as a creative principle.It must
simulate all the powers and attributes of the infinite creative mind.If the creative mind gave rise to a spiritual universe and spiritual
man, by which it expresses itself, then this suppositional opposite
must present its universe and its man, opposite in every particular to
the reality._It is this sort of man and this sort of universe that
we, as mortals, seem to see all about us, and that we refer to as
human beings and the physical universe._ And yet, all that we see,
feel, hear, smell, or taste is the false, suppositional thought that
comes into our so-called mentalities, and by its suppositional
activity there causes what we call consciousness or awareness of
things.""Then," said Father Waite, more to enunciate his own thought than to
question the deduction, "what the human consciousness holds as
knowledge is little more than belief and speculation, with no basis of
truth, no underlying principle."And it brings out the fruits of such beliefs in discord,
decay, and final dissolution, called death.For this human consciousness
forms its own concept of a fleshly body, and a mind-and-matter man.It
makes the laws which govern its body, and it causes its body to obey
these false laws.Upon the quality of thought entering this human
consciousness depend all the phenomena of earthly life and environment
which the mortal experiences.The human consciousness, in other words,
is a _self-centered mass of erroneous thought, utterly without any basis
of real principle, but actively engaged in building up mental images,
and forming and maintaining an environment in which it supposes
itself to live_._This false thought in the human consciousness forms
into a false concept of man, and this is the soul-and-body man, the
mind-and-matter man, which is called a human being, or a mortal._"

"And there," commented Carmen, with a dreamy, far-away look, "we have
what Padre Jose so long ago spoke of as the 'externalization of
thought.'It is the same law which Jesus had in mind when he said, 'As
a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.'""For we know only what enters our mentalities and
becomes active there.And every thought that does so enter, tends at
once to become externalized.That is, there is at once the tendency
for us to see it visualized in some way, either as material object, or
environment, or on our bodies.And it is the very activity of such
thought that constitutes the human mentality, as I have already
said.""And that thought is continually changing," suggested Father Waite.Its very lack of true principle requires that it should
change constantly, in order to simulate as closely as possible the
real.That accounts for the fleeting character of the whole human
concept of man and the physical universe.The human personality is
never fixed, although the elements of human character remain; that is,
those elements which are essentially unreal and mortal, such as lust,
greed, hatred, and materiality, seem to remain throughout the ages.They will give way only before truth, even as Paul said.But not until
truth has been admitted to the human mentality and begins its solvent
work there, the work of denying and tearing down the false
thought-concepts and replacing them with true ones.""And will truth come through the physical senses?"Their supposed testimony is the material thought which enters
the human mentality and becomes active there, resulting in human
consciousness of both good and evil.And that thought will have to
give way to true thought, before we can begin to put off the 'old man'
and put on the 'new.'Human thoughts, or, as we say, the physical
senses, do not and can not testify of absolute truth.exclaimed Haynerd, rousing up."There goes the Church, and
original sin, and fallen man!""There is no such thing as 'fallen man,' my friend," said Hitt
quietly."The spiritual man, the image and likeness, the reflection,
of the infinite creative mind, is perfect as long as its principle
remains perfect--and that is eternally.He is a product of false, suppositional thought.He did not fall, because he has had no perfection
to lose."Reverend Patterson Moore, who had sat a silent, though not wholly
sympathetic listener throughout the discussion, could now no longer
withhold his protest."No wonder," he abruptly exclaimed, "that there
are so few deep convictions to-day concerning the great essentials of
Christianity!As I sit here and listen to you belittle God and rend
the great truths of His Christ, as announced in His Word, the Bible, I
am moved by feelings poignantly sorrowful!The Christ has once been
crucified; and will you slay him again?""No," said Carmen, her eyes dilating with surprise, "but we would
resurrect him!Don't you think you have kept him in the tomb long
enough?The Christ-principle is intended for use, not for endless
burial!"My dear Miss Carmen, it is I who preach the risen Christ!""And
because of centuries of such preaching the world has steadily sunk
from the spiritual to the material, and lip service has taken the
place of that genuine spiritual worship which knows no evil, and
which, because of that practical knowledge, heals the sick and raises
the dead.""No, I state facts," said Carmen."Paul made some mistakes, for he was
consumed with zeal.But he stated truth when he said that the second
coming of Christ would occur when the 'old man' was put off.We have
been discussing the 'old man' to-night, and showing how he may be put
off.Now do you from your pulpit teach your people how that may be
done?""I teach the vicarious atonement of the Christ, and prepare my flock
for the world to come," replied the minister with some heat."But I am interested in the eternal present," said the girl, "not in a
suppositional future.'I am that which is, and which was, and which is to come,' says
the infinite, ever-present mind, God!""I see no Christianity whatsoever in your speculative philosophy,"
retorted the minister."If what you say is true, and the world should
accept it, all that we have learned in the ages past would be blotted
out, and falsehood would be written across philosophy, science, and
religion.By wafting evil lightly aside as unreal, you dodge the
issue, and extend license to all mankind to indulge it freely.Evil is
an awful, a stupendous fact!And it can not be relegated to the realm
of shadow, as you are trying to do!""You know, Duns Scotus
said: 'Since there is no real being outside of God, evil has no
substantial existence.Perfection and reality are synonyms, hence
absolute imperfection is synonymous with absolute unreality.'And do you really think he looked upon
evil as a _reality_?""Then, if that is true," said the girl, "I will have to reject him.But come, we are right up to the point of discussing him and his
teachings, and that will be the subject of our next meeting.It is love, you know, that has drawn us all
together."It's an open forum, Moore," said the doctor, patting him on the back."Wisdom isn't going to die with you."I am quite well satisfied with my present one, Doctor," replied the
minister tartly."Well, then, come and correct us when we err.It's your duty to save
us if we're in danger, you know.""And now, Carmen, the piano awaits you.By
the way, what did Maitre Rossanni tell you?""Oh," replied the girl lightly, "he begged me to let him train me for
Grand Opera.""He said I would make a huge fortune," she laughed."I told him I carried my wealth with me, always, and that my fortune
was now so immense that I couldn't possibly hope to add to it."Hitt," she said, going to him and looking up into his
face, "I am too busy for Grand Opera and money-making.I couldn't be happy if I made people pay to hear
me sing."With that she turned and seated herself at the piano, where she
launched into a song that made the very Reverend Patterson Moore raise
his glasses and stare at her long and curiously.CHAPTER 7


Man reasons and seeks human counsel; but woman obeys her instincts.Her life had been one of utter freedom from
dependence upon human judgment.The burden of decision as to the
wisdom of a course of action rested always upon her own thought.Never
did she seek to make a fellow-being her conscience.When the day of
judgment came, the hour of trial or vital demand, it found her
standing boldly, because her love was made perfect, not through
instinct alone, but through conformity with the certain knowledge that
he who lacks wisdom may find it in the right thought of God and man.And so, when on the next day she joined Hitt and Haynerd in the office
of the Social Era, and learned that Carlson had met their terms,
eagerly, and had transferred to them the moribund Express, she had no
qualms as to the wisdom of the step which they were taking.Haynerd was a composite picture of doubt
and fear, as he sat humped up in his chair.Hitt was serious to the
point of gloom, reflecting in a measure his companion's dismal
forebodings."I was scared to death for fear he wouldn't sell," Haynerd was saying
as the girl entered; "and I was paralyzed whenever I thought that he
would."Carmen laughed aloud when she heard these words."Do you know," she
said, "you remind me of Lot's wife.She was told to go ahead, along
the right course.But she looked back--alas for her!Now you two being
started right are looking back; and you are about to turn to salt
tears!"Now listen," she continued, as Haynerd began to remonstrate; "don't
voice a single fear to me!You couldn't make me believe them true even
if you argued for weeks--and we have no time for such foolishness
now.The first thing that you have got to do, Ned, is to start a
little cemetery.In it you must bury your fears, right away, and
without any mourning.Put up little headstones, if you wish; but don't
ever go near the place afterward, excepting to plant the insults, and
gibes, and denouncements, and vilifications which the human mind will
hurl at you, once the Express starts out on its new career.Good is
bound to stir up evil; and the Express is now in the business of good.Remember, the first thing the Apostles always did was to be afraid.And they kept Jesus busy pointing out the nothingness of their
fears.""I guess we'll find
ourselves a bit lonely in it, too!""True, humanly speaking," replied the girl, taking a chair beside him."But, Ned, let me tell you of the most startling thing I have found in
this great, new country.It is this: you Americans have, oh, so much
animal courage--and so little true moral courage!You know that the
press is one of the most corrupt institutions in America, don't you?Going into thousands of homes every day, it is
a deadlier menace than yellow fever.You know that it is muzzled by
so-called religious bodies, by liquor interests, by vice-politicians,
by commercialism, and its own craven cowardice.And yet, Ned, despite
your heart-longing, you dare not face the world and stand boldly for
righteousness in the conduct of the Express!"Now," she went on hurriedly, "let me tell you more.While you have
been debating with your fears as you awaited Mr.Carlson's decision, I
have been busy.If I had allowed my mentality to become filled with
fear and worry, as you have done, I would have had no room for real,
constructive thought.But I first thanked God for this grand
opportunity to witness to Him; and then I put out every mental
suggestion of failure, of malicious enmity from the world, and from
those who think they do not love us, and with it every subtle argument
about the unpreparedness of the human mind for good.After that I set
out to visit various newspaper offices in the city.I have talked with
four managing and city editors since yesterday noon.I have their
viewpoints now, and know what motives animate them.I know, in part, what the Express will have to meet--and how to
meet it."Both men stared at her in blank amazement.Haynerd's jaw dropped as he
gazed.He had had a long apprenticeship in the newspaper field, but
never would he have dared attempt what this fearless girl had just
done."I have found out what news is," Carmen resumed."It is wholly _a
human invention_!It is the published vagaries of the carnal mind.In
the yellow journal it is the red-inked, screaming report of the
tragedies of sin.Fallom if he knew anything about mental
laws, and the terrible results of mental suggestion in his paper's
almost hourly heralding of murder, theft, and lust.But he only
laughed and said that the lurid reports of crime tended to keep people
alive to what was going on about them.He couldn't see that he was
making a terrible reality of every sort of evil, and holding it so
constantly before an ignorant, credulous world's eyes that little else
could be seen.The moral significance of his so-called news reports
had no meaning whatsoever for him!"asked Haynerd, not believing that she would
have dared visit that journalistic demon."Yes," answered the girl, to his utter astonishment.Adams said
he had no time for maudlin sentimentalism or petticoat sophistry.He
was in the business of collecting and disseminating news, and he
wanted that news to go _shrieking_ out of his office!You can see how the report of an Italian
wife-murder shrieks in red letters an inch high on the very first
page.Or has
he further prostituted journalism by this ignorant act?""The people want it, Carmen," said Hitt slowly, though his voice
seemed not to sound a real conviction."If the church and the
press were not mortally and morally blind, they would see the deadly
destruction which they are accomplishing by shrieking from pulpit and
sanctum: 'Evil is real!Pietro Lasanni cuts his wife's throat!"But, Carmen, while what you say is doubtless true, it must be
admitted that the average man, especially the day laborer, reads his
yellow journal avidly, and--"

"Yes, he does," returned the girl.The average man, as
you call him, is a victim of _the most pernicious social system
ever devised by the human mind_!Swept along in the mad rush of
commercialism, or ground down beneath its ruthless wheels, his
jaded, jarred nerves and his tired mind cry out for artificial
stimulation, for something that will for a moment divert his wearied
thought from his hopeless situation.The Church offers him little
that is tangible this side of the grave.But whiskey, drugs, and
yellow journalism do.Hitt--can't you, Ned--that
the world's cry for sensationalism is but a cry for something that
will make it forget its misery for a brief moment?The average man
feels the superficiality of the high speed of this century of mad
rush; he longs as never before for a foundation of truth upon which to
rest; he is tired of theological fairy-tales; he is desperately
tired of sin, and sickness, and dying.He cares little about a
promised life beyond the grave.He wants help here and now to solve
his problems.Little beyond a recount
of his own daily miseries, and reports of graft and greed, and
accounts of vulgar displays of material wealth that he has not and
can not have.And these reports divert his jaded mind for a moment and
give him a false, fleeting sense of pleasure--and then leave him
sunk deeper than before in despair, and in hatred of existing
conditions!""The girl is right," said Hitt, turning to Haynerd."And we knew it,
of course.This steam-calliope
age reflects the human-mind struggle for something other than its own
unsatisfying ideas.It turns to thrills; it expresses its restlessness
and dissatisfaction with itself by futurist and cubist art, so-called;
by the rattle and vibration of machinery; by flaring billboards that
insult every sense of the artistic; and by the murk and muck of yellow
journalism, with its hideous  supplements and spine-thrilling
tales.But the publisher himself--well, he
battens materially, of course, upon the tired victims of our degrading
social system.He sees but the sordid revenue in dollars and cents."And they can't," said Haynerd."Decent journalism wouldn't
pay--doesn't--never did!Other papers have tried it, and miserably
failed!""Then," returned Hitt calmly, after a moment's reflection, "oil will
meet the deficit.As long as my paternal wells flow in Ohio the
Express will issue forth as a clean paper, a dignified, law-supporting
purveyor to a taste for better things--even if it has to create that
taste.Its columns will be closed to salacious sensation, and its
advertising pages will be barred to vice, liquor, tobacco, and
drugs.""And now we've got to get right down to
business.""Just so," said Hitt, rising."It is my intention to issue the Express
one more week on its present basis, and then turn it into a penny
morning daily.I'm going to assume the management myself, with you, Carmen, as
my first assistant."But, first, how far may
I go?""The limit," replied Hitt, rubbing his hands together."You are my
brain, so to speak, henceforth.As to financial resources, I am
prepared to dump a hundred thousand dollars right into the Express
before a cent of revenue comes back.""Another question, then: will you issue a Sunday edition?""For a while, yes," he said."We'll see how it works, for I have some
ideas to try out.""Well, then," resumed the girl eagerly, "I want this paper to be for
_all_ the people; to be independent in the truest sense of the term;
and to be absolutely beyond the influence of political and religious
sectarianism--you'll soon enough learn what that will cost you--to be
an active, constructive force in this great city, and a patient,
tireless, loving educator."grunted Haynerd, although he was listening very carefully."The Express will succeed," the girl went on, without noticing him,
"because our thought regarding it is successful._We_ have already
succeeded; and that success will be externalized in our work.It makes
no difference what the people may think of _us_; but it makes a lot of
difference what _we_ think of _them_ and _ourselves_.We assume superiority over adverse conditions, and we
claim success, because we know that these things are mental, and that
they are divinely ours.Lot's wife didn't have the sort of confidence
that wins--she looked back.But
there is no doubt of the outcome.And so there is no doubt lurking in
us to take the edge off our efforts, is there?The thought regarding
the Express has not been timidly born within us; it has come forth
flashing vigor!Yes it has, Ned, despite your doubts!And we have
within us a power mightier than any force outside of us.That is the
knowledge of infinite mind's omnipotence, and our ability to use the
Christ-principle to meet _every_ problem.Haynerd began to rouse up with a returning sense of confidence.Hitt
smiled and nodded to Carmen.The girl went on rapidly and eagerly:

"We are going to give the people news from a new standpoint, aren't
we?We are not going on the assumption that the report of mankind's
errors is the report of real news.The only thing that is really new
is _good_.Adams's office two
items came in over the 'phone.One was the report of a jewel robbery,
and the other was an announcement of the draining by the Government of
submerged lands in Louisiana, so as to give an additional opportunity
to those seeking farms.Adams put in bold type on
the front page?I was unable to locate the latter
anywhere in the paper, although it was a timely bit of news.""Now another thing," continued the girl, "I want the Sunday edition of
the Express to contain a resume of the important and vital news of the
week, with the very clearest, most impartial and enlightening
editorial comment upon it.This calls for nice discrimination in the
selection of those items for our comment.It means, however, the best
practical education for the people.This was John Ruskin's idea, and
certainly is a splendid one.Still another thing, the Express will
stand shoulder to shoulder with the women for equal suffrage."It is the women who will clean up
and regenerate this world, not the men.Reform is now in the hands of
the women.And India proves that
backward women mean a backward nation.""Then," continued Carmen, "make a distinct Women's Department in the
Express, and put Miss Wall on the staff.""A daily educational department for foreigners, our immigrants, giving
them every possible aid in suggestions regarding their naturalization,
the languages, hotels, boarding houses, employment, and so on.""The Express is going to maintain a social service, and night schools.It is going to establish vacation and permanent homes for girls.It is
going to provide for vocational training.It is going to establish a
lecture bureau--for lectures on _good_.It is going to build a model
city for workingmen.Then it is going to found a model city for
everybody.It is going to establish clubs and meeting places for
workingmen, places where they may meet, and play games, and read, and
have social intercourse, and practical instruction.It is going to
establish the same for young boys.It is going to take the lead for
civic betterment in this city, and for child-welfare, and for--"

By this time Haynerd was sitting erect and staring in bewilderment at
the girl."Aren't you wandering
somewhat beyond strict newspaper limits?"And haven't I told you," returned the girl promptly, "that the only
thing new in this world is _good_?Our news is going to be _good_
news--the collection and dissemination of _good_ to all mankind.People who read our paper will no longer feel that it is dangerous to
be alive, but a glorious privilege.Hitt said I could go the limit, you know."Hitt had caught the girl's infectious enthusiasm, and his face was
beaming."It's your unlimited thought, Carmen, that
we old dry-bones want!What is anything in this life, compared with real
service to our fellow-men?_The Express is not in business to make
money!_ It is in the business of collecting and scattering the news of
good.Its dividends will be the happiness and joy it gives to mankind.For _good is the greatest success there
is_!"It is likely that Hitt did not catch the full meaning of the girl's
words; and it is certain that Haynerd did not.But her boundless
enthusiasm did penetrate in large degree into their souls, and they
ceased to insist on the query, Will it pay?The broader outlook was
already beginning to return profits to these men, as the newer
definition of 'news' occupied their thought.Seizing their hats, they bade Carmen go with them to inspect the plant
of the Express, and meet its staff."There's a question I'd like to ask," said Haynerd, as they pursued
their way toward their recent purchase."I want to know what our
editorial policy will be.Do we condone the offenses of our grafters
and spoilsmen by remaining silent regarding their crimes?"We will let their guilt expose and kill itself," quickly returned
Carmen.A few minutes later they entered the gloomy, dust-laden offices of the
Express.Hitt's spirits sank again as he looked about him.But Carmen
seemed to suffer no loss of enthusiasm.After a mental appraisal of
the dingy, uninviting environment she exclaimed: "Well, one nice thing
about this is that we don't have much to start with!"Hitt reflected upon her cryptical remark, and then laughed.It was evident that the sale of
his plant had removed a heavy load from his shoulders."My best reporter was out yesterday when you called," he said,
addressing Hitt."He--well, he was a little the worse for wear.Come into my office and I'll send for him."In a few minutes a tall, boyish fellow responded to the editor's
summons.He must have been well under twenty, thought Hitt, marveling
that so young a man should be regarded as Carlson's best news
gatherer.But his wonder grew apace when the editor introduced him as
Mr.The lad smiled pallidly, as he bent his gaze upon Carmen, and
addressed his reply to her."My governor," he said laconically.returned Haynerd, beginning to bristle.Carlson dismissed the reporter, and turned to the curious group."The boy has the making of a fine newspaper man in him.Has something
of his father's terrible energy.He used to come down here before his father threw him out.I
let him write little articles for the Express when he was barely
sixteen years old; and they were mighty good, too.But he got mixed up
in some scandal, and J. Wilton cut him off.The boy always did drink,
I guess.But since his family troubles he's been on the straight road
to the insane asylum."His father is no
friend of mine, and--"

"We _shall_ keep him," calmly interrupted Carmen."His father is a
_very_ good friend of mine."Carlson looked from one to the other quizzically."Well," squinting over his glasses at the girl, "this surely is
woman's era, isn't it?"*       *       *       *       *

A week later the Express, scarcely recognizable in its clean, fresh
type and modest headlines, with its crisp news and well written
editorials, very unostentatiously made its entry into the already
crowded metropolitan field.Adams picked it up and
laughed, a short, contemptuous laugh.Fallom glanced over it and
wondered.J. Wilton Ames, who had been apprised of its advent, threw
it into the waste basket--and then drew it out again.He re-read the
editorial announcing the policy of the paper.From that he began a
careful survey of the whole sheet.His eye caught an article on the
feminist movement, signed by Carmen Ariza.His lip curled, but he read
the article through, and finished with the mental comment that it was
well written."I want this sheet carefully watched," he commanded, tossing the paper
to his secretary."If anything is noticed that in any way refers to me
or my interests, call my attention to it immediately."A moment afterward Henry Claus,
nominal head of the great Claus brewing interests, was ushered in.cried the newcomer, rushing
forward and clasping the financier's hand."The city council last
night voted against the neighborhood saloon license bill!"Yes," commented the laconic Ames."Our aldermen are a very
intelligent lot of statesmen, Claus.They're wise enough to see that
their jobs depend upon whiskey.It requires very astute statesmanship,
Claus, to see that.But some of our congressmen and senators have
learned the same thing."The brewer pondered this delphic utterance and scratched his head."Well," continued Ames, "have you your report?""Sales
less than last month," he remarked dryly."It's the local option law what done it, Mr.Ames," replied the brewer
apologetically."Them women--"

"Bah!Let a few petticoats whip you, eh?But, anyway, you don't know
how to market your stuff.Look here, Claus, you've got to encourage
the young people more.We've got to get the girls and boys.If we get
the girls, we'll get the boys easily enough.It's the same in the
liquor business as in certain others, Claus, you've got to land them
young."Ames, I can't take 'em and pour it down their throats!""You could if you knew how," returned Ames.if I had
nothing else to do I'd just like to devote myself to the sales end of
the brewing business.I'd use mental suggestion in such a way through
advertising that this country would drown in beer!Beer is just plain
beer to you dull-wits.But suppose we convinced people that it was a
food, eh?Advertise a chemical analysis of it, showing that it has
greater nutriment than beef.Catch the clerks and poor stenographers
that way.Don't call it beer; call it Maltdiet, or something like
that.Why, we couldn't begin to supply the demand!""Billboards in every field and along all railroads and highways;
boards in every vacant lot in every town and city in the country;
electric signs everywhere; handbills; lectures--never thought of that,
did you?And samples--why, I'd put samples into every house in the
Union!I'd give away a million barrels of beer--and sell a hundred
million as a result!But I'd work particularly with the young people.Work on them with literature and suggestion; they're more receptive
than adults.The hypnotism that works through suggestive advertising,
Claus, is simply omnipotent!"We have all the papers, excepting the Express, Mr.You can
afford to pass it up.It's run by a college professor and a doll-faced
girl."Ames, our advertising manager tells me that the publishers
of the Express called a meeting of the managers of all the other city
papers, to discuss cutting out liquor advertising, and that since then
the rates have gone up, way up!You see, the example set by the
Express may--"

"Humph!"An example, backed by
absolute fearlessness--and he knew from experience that the publishers
of the Express were without fear--well, it could not be wholly
ignored, even if the new paper had no circulation worth the name.Ames," resumed the brewer, "the Express is in every newsstand in
the city.It's in every hotel, in every
saloon, in every store and business house here.It
isn't sold, it's given away!"Leave it to me, Claus," he said at length, dismissing the brewer."I'll send for you in a day or so."*       *       *       *       *

It was well after midnight when the little group assembled in the
dining room of the Beaubien cottage to resume their interrupted
discussions.Hitt and Haynerd were the last to arrive.With him had come, not without
some reluctance, his prickly disputant, Reverend Patterson Moore, and
another friend and colleague, Doctor Siler, whose interest in these
unique gatherings had been aroused by Morton."I've tried to give him a resume of our previous deductions," the
latter explained, as Hitt prepared to open the discussion."And he
says he has conscientious scruples--if you know what that means.""He's a Philistine, that's all, eh?""I am like my friend, Reverend Edward
Hull, who says--"

"There!""Your friend has a life job molding the
plastic minds of prospective preachers, and he doesn't want to lose
the sinecure.Got a wife and babies depending on
him.He still preaches hell-fire and the resurrection of the flesh,
doesn't he?Well, in that case we can dispense with his views, for
we've sent that sort of doctrine to the ash heap."Reverend Moore opened his mouth as if to protest; but Hitt prevented
him by taking the floor and plunging at once into his subject."The
hour is very late," he said in apology, "and we have much ground to
cover.Carmen stole a hand beneath the table and grasped the Beaubien's."As I sat in my office this morning," began Hitt meditatively, "I
looked often and long through the window and out over this great,
roaring city.Everywhere I saw tremendous activity, frantic hurry, and
nerve-racking strife.In the distance I marked the smoke curling
upward from huge factories, packing houses, and elevators.The
incessant seething, the rush and bustle, the noise, the heat, and
dust, all spelled business, an enormous volume of human business--and
yet, _not one iota of it contributed even a mite to the spiritual
nature and needs of mankind_!And then I looked down, far down, into the
streets below.And I saw,
too, men and women, rich and comfortable, riding along happily in
their automobiles, with not a thought beyond their physical
well-being.But, I asked myself, should they not ride thus, if they
wish?And yet, the hour will soon come when sickness, disaster, and
death will knock at their doors and sternly bid them come out."Just what I have sought to impress upon you whenever you advanced
your philosophical theories, Doctor," said Reverend Moore, turning to
Morton.The doctor glowered back at him without reply."Now what should the man in the automobile do?Is there anything he
_can_ do, after all?Jesus told such as he to seek
first the kingdom of harmony--a demonstrable understanding of truth.The automobile riding would follow after that, and with safety.Why,
oh, why, will we go on wasting our precious time acquiring additional
physical sensations in motor cars, amusement parks, travel, anywhere
and everywhere, instead of laboring first to acquire that real
knowledge which alone will set us free from the bitter woes of human
existence!""Jesus set us free, sir," interposed Reverend Moore sternly."And his
vicarious atonement opens the door of immortality to all who believe
on his name."Moore, you believe will be acquired only after
death.At present we see mankind laboring for that which even they
themselves admit is not meat.They waste their substance for what is
not bread.Because of their false beliefs of God and man,
externalized in a viciously cruel social system; because of their
dependence upon the false supports of _materia medica_, orthodox
theology, man-devised creeds, and human opinions."And yet, who hath believed our report?men in our
day think and read little that is serious; and they reflect hardly at
all upon the vital things of life.They want to be let alone in their
comfortable materialistic beliefs, even though those beliefs rend
them, rive them, rack and twist them with vile, loathsome disease, and
then sink them into hideous, worm-infested graves!The human mind does
not want its undemonstrable beliefs challenged.It does not want the
light of unbiased investigation thrown upon the views which it has
accepted ready-made from doctor and theologian.Because,
my friends, the human mind is inert, despite its seemingly tremendous
material activity.And its inertia is the result of its own
self-mesmerism, its own servile submission to beliefs which, as
Balfour has shown, have grown up under every kind of influence except
that of genuine evidence.Chief of these are the prevalent religious
beliefs, which we are asked to receive as divinely inspired."But that
gentleman sat stolid, with arms folded and a scowl upon his sharp
features."Religion," continued Hitt, "is that which binds us to the real.what a farce mankind have made of it.Because, in its mad
desire to make matter real and to extract all pleasures from it, the
human mind has tried to eliminate the soul.""We have been having a bad spell of materialism, that's true,"
interposed Doctor Morton."Well," Hitt replied, "perhaps so.Yet almost in our own day France
put God out of her institutions; set up and crowned a prostitute as
the goddess of reason; and trailed the Bible through the streets of
Paris, tied to the tail of an ass!And in this country we have enthroned so-called physical
science, and, as Comte predicted, are about to conduct God to the
frontier and bow Him out with thanks for His provisional services.As our droll philosopher, Hubbard, has said, 'Once
man was a spirit, now he is matter.Once he was a flame, now he is a
candlestick.Once he was a son of God, now he is a chemical formula.Once he was an angel, now he is plain mud.'""But," exclaimed Reverend Moore, visibly nettled, "that is because of
his falling away from the Church--"

"My friend," said Hitt calmly, "he fell away from the Church because
he could not stagnate longer with her and be happy.Orthodox theology
has largely become mere sentimentalism.The average man has a horror
of being considered a namby-pamby, religiously weak, wishy-washy,
so-called Christian.It makes him ashamed of himself to stand up
in a congregation and sing 'My Jesus, I love Thee,' and 'In
mansions of glory and endless delight.'And he is far more concerned about his little brick bungalow
and next month's rent than he is about celestial mansions.No; he leaves religion to women, whom he regards as the
weaker sex.He turns to the ephemeral wisdom of human science--and,
poor fool!Well, how
often nowadays do you hear the name of God on their lips?Is He ever the topic of conversation at
receptions and balls?No; that person was right who said that
religion 'does not rise to the height of successful gossip.'It
stands no show with the latest cabaret dance, the slashed skirt,
and the daringly salacious drama as a theme of discourse.Oh, yes,
we still maintain our innumerable churches.And, though religion is
the most vital thing in the world to us, we hire a preacher to talk
to us once a week about it!Would we hire men to talk once a week to
us about business?But religion is far, far less important to
human thought than business--for the latter means automobiles and
increased opportunities for physical sensation."Hitt," objected Doctor Siler, "I am sure this is not such a
godless era as you would make out.""We have many gods, chief of whom is matter.The
world's acknowledged god is not spirit, despite the inescapable fact
that the motive-power of the universe is spiritual, and the only
action is the expression of thought."But now," he continued, "we have in our previous discussions made
some startling deductions, and we came to the conclusion that there is
a First Cause, and that it is infinite mind.But, having agreed upon
that, are we now ready to admit the logical corollary, namely, that
there can be but _one_ real mind?For that follows from the premise
that there is but one God who is infinite.""We have but the one mind, God," he replied.Human men reflect the communal mortal
mind, which is the suppositional opposite of the divine mind that is
God.I repeat, the so-called human mind knows not God.It sees only its own interpretations of Him
and His manifestations."Well, they might be," suggested Doctor Siler."Well then," he said, "if you will not admit that all
things are mental--including the entire universe--you certainly are
forced to admit that your comprehension of things is mental.""Then you will likewise have to admit that you are not concerned with
_things_, but with your comprehension of things.""And so, after all, you deal only with mental things--and everything
is mental to you.""The Bible states clearly that He created _all_ things," returned that
gentleman a little stiffly."My friends," resumed Hitt very earnestly, "we are on the eve of a
tremendous enlightenment, I believe.And for that we owe much to the
so-called 'theory of suppositional opposites.'We have settled to our
satisfaction that, although mankind believe themselves to be dependent
upon air, food, and water for existence, nevertheless they are really
dependent upon something vastly finer, which is back of those things.That'something' we call God, for it is good.Matthew Arnold said that
the only thing that can be verified about God is that He is 'the
eternal power that makes for righteousness.'Very well, we are almost
willing to accept that alone--for that carries infinite implications.It makes God an eternal, spiritual power, omnipotent as an influence
for good.It makes Him the infinite patron, so to speak, of
right-thinking.So it makes Him
the sole creative force."But," he continued, "force, or power, is not material.God by very
necessity is mind, including all intelligence.And His operations are
conducted according to the spiritual law of evolution.Oh, yes,
evolution is not a theory, it is a fact.God, infinite mind, evolves,
uncovers, reveals, unfolds, His numberless eternal ideas.The greatest of these is the one that
includes all others and expresses and reflects Him perfectly.That is the man who was'made'--revealed, manifested--in
His image and likeness.There is no other image and likeness of God.Moreover, God has always existed, and always will.So His ideas,
including real man, have had no beginning.They were not created, as
we regard creation, but have been unfolded.But now we come to the peculiar part,
namely, the fact that _reality seems always to have its shadow in
unreality_.The magnet has
its opposite poles, one positive, the other negative.At the lowest ebb of the
world's morals appeared the Christ.The Christian religion springs
from the soil of a Roman Emperor's blood-soaked gardens.Errors hampering the solving of
mathematical problems.That
which stands the test of demonstration as to permanence, I say with
Spencer."And now we learn that it is the _communal mortal mind_ that stands as
the opposite and negative of the infinite mind that is God, and that
it is but a supposition, without basis of real principle or fact.It
has its law of evolution, too, and evolves its types in human beings
and animals, in mountain, tree, and stream.All material nature, in
fact, is but the manifestation, or reflection, of this communal mortal
mind."But, though God had no beginning, and will have no ending, this
communal mortal mind, on the contrary, did have a seeming beginning,
and will end its pseudo-existence.It seemingly
evolved its universe, and its earth as its lower stratum.It made its
firmament, and it gradually filled its seas with moving things that
manifested its idea of life.Slowly, throughout inconceivable eons of
time, it unrolled and evolved, until at last, through untold
generations of stupid, sluggish, often revolting animal forms, it
began to evolve a type of mind, a crude representation of the mind
that is God, and manifesting its own concept of intelligence."Now what was this communal mortal mind doing?Counterfeiting divine
mind, if I may so express it.But
types that were without basis of principle, and so they passed
away--the higher forms died, the lower disintegrated.Aye, death came
into the world because of sin, for the definition of sin is the
Aramaic word which Jesus used, translated '_hamartio_,' which means
'missing the mark.'Yes, sin came through Adam, for
Adam is the name of the communal mortal mind."Well, ages and ages passed, reckoned in the human mind concept of
time.The evolution was continually toward a higher and ever higher
type.Paleolithic man still died, because he did not have enough real
knowledge in his mortal mind to keep him from missing the mark.He
probably had no belief in a future life, for he did not bury his dead
after the manner of those who later manifested this belief.But, after
the lapse of centuries, Neolithic man was found manifesting such a
belief.This: the mortal mind was translating the
divine idea of immortality into its own terms and thus expressing it.The curtain began to rise upon what we call human
history.The idea of a power not itself began to filter through the
mist of mortal mind, and human beings felt its influence, the
influence that makes for righteousness.And then, at last, through the
mortal mind there began to filter the idea of the one God.The people
who best reflected this idea were the ancient Israelites.They called
themselves the 'chosen' people.Their so-called minds were, as Carmen
has expressed it, like window-panes that were a little cleaner than
the others.They let a bit more of the light through.God is light,
you know, according to the Scriptures.And little by little they began
to record their thoughts regarding their concept of the one God.And soon they were seeing their God
manifested everywhere, and hearing His voice in every sound of Nature.And thus began that strange and mighty
book, the Bible, _the record of the evolution of the concept of God in
the human mind_.""Do you mean to say that the Bible was not given by inspiration?""This filtering process that I have been speaking
about _is_ inspiration.Every bit of truth that comes to you or me
to-day comes by inspiration--the breathing in--of the infinite mind
that is truth."And so," he went on, "we have those reflections of the communal
mortal mind which we call the Israelites recording their thoughts and
ideas.Sometimes they recorded plain fact; sometimes they wrapped
their moral teachings in allegories and fables.Josephus says of Moses
that he wrote some things enigmatically, some allegorically, and the
rest in plain words, since in his account of the first chapter of
Genesis and the first three verses of the second he gives no hint of
any mystery at all.But when he comes to the fourth verse of the
second chapter he says Moses, after the seventh day was over, began
to talk philosophically, and so he understood the rest of the second
and third chapters in some enigmatical and allegorical sense.Quite
so, it appears to me, for the writer, whoever he was, was then
attempting the impossible task of explaining the enigma of evil, the
origin of which is associated always with the dust-man.""You deny the truth of the account of the creation as given in the
second chapter of Genesis, do you?""You deny
that man was tempted and fell?""Well," said Hitt, smiling, "of course there is no special reason for
denying that serpents may have talked, millions and millions of years
ago.In fact, they still have rudimentary organs of speech--as do most
animals.Snakes developed in the
Silurian Era, some twenty million years ago.In the vast intervening
stretch of time they may have lost their power to talk.But, as for
the second chapter of Genesis, Moses may or may not have written it.Indeed, he may not have written the first.The book of
Genesis shows plainly that it is a composite of several books by
various authors.I incline to the belief that some more materialistic
hand and mind than Moses's composed that second chapter.However that
may be, it is a splendid example of the human mind's crude attempt to
interpret the spiritual creation in its own material terms.It in a
way represents the dawning upon the human mind of the idea of the
spiritual creation.For when finite sense approaches the infinite it
must inevitably run into difficulties with which it can not cope; it
must meet problems which it can not solve, owing to its lack of a
knowledge of the infinite principle involved.That's why the world
rejected the first account of the creation and accepted the second,
snake-story, dust-man, apple tree, and all."exclaimed Haynerd, his eyes wide agape."You're like a
story-book!"We know that man appeared on this
earth in comparatively recent times.For millions and millions of
years before he was evolved animals and vegetables had been dying."Your difficulty arises from the fact that
we are accustomed to associate sin with human personality.But
remember, the physical universe has been evolved from the communal
mortal mind.It has been dying from
the very beginning of its seeming existence, for its seeming existence
alone is sin.The vegetables, the animals, and now the men, that have
been evolved from it, and that express it and reflect and manifest
it, must die, necessarily, because the so-called mind from which they
evolve is not based upon the eternal, immortal principle, God.And so
it and they miss the mark, and always have done so.You must cease to
say, Whose sin?Remember that the sin is inherent in the so-called
mind that is expressed by things material.The absence of the
principle which is God is sin, according to the Aramaic word,
translated '_hamartio_,' which Jesus used.The most lowly cell that
swam in the primeval seas manifested the communal mortal mind's sin,
and died as a consequence.""In other words, it manifested a supposition, as opposed to truth?""Its existence was quite suppositional," replied Hitt."It did not
manifest life, but a material sense of existence.And so the communal mortal mind,
so-called, determined these first lowly material and objective forms
of existence.They were its phenomena, and they manifested it.Different types now manifest it, after long ages.But all are equally
without basis of principle, all are subject to the mortal law that
everything material contains within itself the elements for its own
destruction, and all must pass away.In our day we are dealing with
the highest type of mortal mind so far evolved, the human man.He,
too, knows but one life, human life, the mortal-mind sense of
existence.His human life is demonstrably only a series of states of
material consciousness, states of thought-activity.The classification
and placing of these states of consciousness give him his sense of
time.The positing of his mental concepts give him his sense of space.His consciousness is a thought-activity, externalizing human opinions,
ideas, and beliefs, not based on truth.This consciousness--or
supposititious human mind--is very finite in nature, and so is
essentially self-centered.It attributes its fleshly existence to
material things.It believes that its life depends upon its fleshly
body; and so it thinks itself in constant peril of losing it.It goes
further, and believes that there are multitudes of other human minds,
each having its own human, fleshly existence, or life, and each
capable of doing it and one another mortal injury.It believes that it
can be deprived by its neighboring mortal minds of all that it needs
for its sustenance, and that it can improve its own status at their
expense, and vice versa.It is filled with fears--not knowing that God
is infinite good--and its fears become externalized as disaster, loss,
calamity, disease, and death at last.It has no basis of principle to rest upon, and so it
constantly shifts and changes to accord with its own shifting thought.It is here to-day, and gone
to-morrow.""Well, Ned," said Hitt, "there is this hope: human consciousness
always refers its states to something.It is infinite mind, God, and its infinite manifestation.The human
mind still translates or interprets God's greatest idea, Man, as 'a
suffering, sinning, troubled creature,' forgetting that this creature
is only a mental concept, and that the human mind is looking only at
its own thoughts, and that these thoughts are counterfeits of God's
real thoughts."Moreover, though the human mind is finite, and can not even begin to
grasp the infinite, the divine mind has penetrated the mist of error.There is a spark of real reflection in every mortal.That spark can be
made to grow into a flame that will consume all error and leave the
real man revealed, a consciousness that knows no evil.There is now
enough of a spark of intelligence in the human, so-called mind to
enable it to lay hold on truth and grow out of itself.And there is no
excuse for not doing so, as Jesus said.If he had not come we wouldn't
have known that we were missing the mark so terribly.""Well," observed Haynerd, "after that classification I don't see that
we mortals have much to be puffed up about!""All human beings, or mortals, Ned," said Hitt, "are interpretations
by the mortal mind of infinite mind's idea of itself, Man.These
interpretations are made in the human mind, and they remain posited
there.All are false,
and doomed to decay.How, then, can one mortal look down with
superciliousness upon another, when all are in the same identical
class?"Carmen's thoughts rested for a moment upon the meaningless existence
of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had anchored her life in the shifting
sands of the flesh and its ephemeral joys."Now," resumed Hitt, "we will come back to the question of progress.What is progress but the growing of the human mind out of itself under
the influence of the divine stimulus of demonstrable truth?And that
is made possible when we grasp the stupendous fact that the human,
mortal mind, including its man, is absolutely unreal and non-existent!The human man changes rapidly in mind, and, consequently, in its lower
stratum, or expression, the body.For that reason he need not carry
over into to-day the old, false beliefs which were manifested by him
yesterday.If he leaves them in the past, they cease to be manifested
in his present or future.Then, opening
himself to truth, he lays off the 'old man' and puts on the 'new.'He
denies himself--denies that there is any truth in the seeming reality
of the mortal, material self--as Jesus bade us do."His ideas and the thoughts regarding them must always have existed.He, as mind, is an inexhaustible
reservoir of thought.Now the human, mortal mind interprets His
thoughts, and so _seems_ to manufacture new thought.It makes new
interpretations, but not new thoughts.When you hear people chatting,
do you think they are manufacturing new thought?They
are but reflecting, or voicing, the communal so-called mortal mind's
interpretations of God's innumerable and real thoughts.""And so," suggested Father Waite, "the more nearly correct our
interpretations of His thoughts are, the nearer we approach to
righteousness.""There exist all sorts of real thoughts
about God's ideas.But the human mind
makes likewise all sorts of erroneous translations of them.We shall
solve our problem of existence when we correctly interpret His
thoughts, and use them only.When the human mentality becomes attuned
or accustomed to certain thoughts, that kind flow into it readily from
the communal mortal mind.Some people think for years along certain
erroneous or criminal lines.Their minds are set in that direction,
and invite such a flow of thought.But were they to reverse the'set,'
there would be a very different and better resulting externalization
in health, prosperity, and morals.""I think I see," said Miss Wall."And I begin to glimpse the true
mission of Jesus, and why he was ready to give up everything for it."And now a word further about the so-called mortal mind.For,
when we have collected and arranged all our data regarding it, we will
find ourselves in a position to begin to work out of it, and thereby
truly work out our salvation, even if with fear and trembling.I have
said in a previous talk that, judging by the deductions of the
physical scientists, everything seems about to leave the material
basis and turn into vibrations, and'man changes with velocity' of
these.They tell us that all life depends upon water; that life began,
eons ago, in the primeval sea.True, the human sense of existence, as
I have said, began in the dark, primeval sea of mist, the deep and
fluid mortal mind, so-called.And that sense of existence most
certainly is dependent upon the fluid of mortal mind.Bichat has said
that 'life is the sum of the forces that resist death.'Spencer has
defined life as the 'continuous adjustment of internal to external
relations.'Very good, as applied to the human sense of life.The
human mind makes multitudes of mental concepts, and then struggles
incessantly to adjust itself to them, and at length gives up the
struggle, hopelessly beaten.Scientists tell us that life is due to a
continuous series of bodily ferments.The body is in a constant state
of ferment, and that gives rise to life.We know that the human
mind is in a state of incessant ferment.The human mind is a
self-centered mass of writhing, seething, fermenting material thought.And that fermentation is outwardly manifested in its concept of body,
and its material environment.The scientists themselves are rapidly
pushing matter back into the realm of the human mind.Bodily states
are becoming recognized as manifestations of mental states--not vice
versa, as has been ignorantly believed for ages.A prominent physician
told me the other day that many a condition of nervous prostration now
could be directly traced to selfishness.We know that hatred and anger
produce fatal poisons.The rattlesnake is a splendid example of that.I am told that its poison and the white of an egg are formed of
_exactly the same amounts of the same elements_.The difference in
effect is the thought lying back of each.""You don't pretend that the snake
thinks and hates--"

"Doctor," said Hitt, "for thousands upon thousands of years the human
race has been directing hatred and fear-thoughts toward the snake.Is
it any wonder that the snake is now poisonous?That it now reflects
back that poisonous thought to mankind?""But some are not poisonous, you know.""Can we say how long they have not been so, or how soon our hatred
will make them all poisonous?Do you know, moreover, that sorrow,
remorse, all emotions, in fact, affect the perspiration that exudes
from the human body?Do you know that hatred will render human
perspiration the deadliest poison known to science?I am told that
in a few minutes of murderous hatred enough of this poisonous
perspiration is exuded from the human body to kill a man.And do
you know that the thought which manifests upon the body in such
deadly poison is just as deadly when sent into the mentality of a
human being?Think what the Church's deadly hatred of so-called
heretics has done in the last nineteen hundred years!Why, millions
have been killed by it alone!"But now," he said, consulting his watch, "I must go.Even a newspaper
man requires a little sleep.And I must make my apology for occupying
the floor to-night to the exclusion of you all.I have gradually been
filling up with these thoughts for some weeks, and I had to let them
out.Hitt," interrupted Father Waite, "I shall soon be ready to report
on those questions of Bible research which you assigned to me.""Well, have you found that Jesus really was
an historical character, or not?""I think," said Carmen, "that he has found that it really matters
little whether there ever was such a person as the human man Jesus.The Christ has always lived; and the Christ-principle which the man
Jesus is reported to have revealed to the world is with us, here, now,
and always.It is the principle, rather than the man Jesus, that
concerns us, is it not?""Miss Carmen," interposed Reverend Moore, "Jesus was the incarnate Son
of God, and your remarks concerning him are--"

"Slow up, Pat!""I'll fight that out with
you on the way home."We will take up that question in our next discussion," said Hitt."But, wait; Carmen must give us just a short song before we part."As she passed Hitt, she
squeezed his hand.A few minutes later the little group dispersed,
with the melody of the girl's voice trembling in their souls.CHAPTER 8


For several days Ames reflected, and waited.Judging by the data which
he was able to secure, the Express was eating up money at a fearful
pace.To continue at that rate meant certain financial disaster in the
near future.And yet the publishers of the rejuvenated sheet seemed
never to count the cost of their experiment.Already they had begun
the introduction of innovations that were startling and even
mirth-provoking to staid, conservative publishers in the journalistic
field.To survive the long period necessary for the education of the
public taste to such things as the Express stood for demanded a source
of income no less permanent than La Libertad itself.The Beaubien, of course, in her
crippled financial condition was affording the Express no monetary
assistance.Haynerd's few thousands were long
since dissipated.And
her estate was handled by Ames and Company!And handled, we may add,
in such a manner that Miss Wall knew naught regarding it, except that
she might draw upon it as one dips water from a hillside spring.And as he meditated upon the new paper and its
promoters, there gradually formed within him a consuming desire to see
again the fair young girl who had drawn him so strongly, despite his
mountainous wrath and his flaming desire to crush her when she boldly
faced him in his own house on the night of his grand reception.Why
had he let her escape him then?True, women had
meant little to him, at least in the last few years.But this girl had
seemed to stir within him new emotions, or those long slumbering.He
knew not, coarsely materialistic as was his current thought, that in
him, as in all who came within the radius of her pure affection, she
had swept chords whose music he had never heard before.And then one morning he took down
the receiver and called up the office of the Express.Hitt was not there--but this was his assistant.And:

"You didn't want to see Mr.Ames nearly dropped the receiver in his astonishment.In the first
place, the girl had read his thought; and in the second, he was not
accustomed to being told that he might go to see people--they came
cringing to him."You may come at twelve-fifteen," continued the clear, firm voice."And remain a half hour; I'm very busy."Ames put down the instrument and looked about, thankful that no one
was there to comment on his embarrassment.Then he leaned back in his
chair and went slowly over in thought the experiences of that eventful
night in his house.Why, this slip of a girl--a half-breed Indian at
best--this mere baby--!But he glanced up at the great electric wall
clock, and wished it were then twelve-fifteen.*       *       *       *       *

At noon Ames, jauntily swinging his light walking stick, strolled
casually into the office of the Express.His air was one of supreme
confidence in his own powers.And
the knowledge rendered him unafraid of God, man, or beast.He had met
and conquered everything mundane, excepting this young girl.But that
thought was now delightful to him.In her he had unearthed a real
novelty, a ceaseless interest.She scratched and nettled him; but she was as nothing in his grasp.The first thing that impressed him on entering the office was the air
of prosperity which hung over the place.The environment, he mentally
commented, was somewhat unusual for a newspaper plant.Order, quiet,
and cleanliness were dominant notes in the prevailing harmony.He
first walked back into the pressroom to see if the same conditions
prevailed there.Then he retraced his steps, and at length came to a
halt before a door bearing the inscription, "Miss Ariza," on the
glass.Turning the knob, he peered curiously in.The room was small, but light and airy.Its furnishings were new, and
its walls had been freshly tinted.A few pictures of good quality hung
about them.At the desk, bending
over a new typewriter, sat Carmen."I beg pardon," said Ames, hesitating in the doorway."You don't mind if I finish
this article, do you?""It's got
to go to the compositors right away.""Certainly--don't stop," replied Ames easily."When we talk I want
your undivided attention.""Oh, you're sure to get it," she returned, laughing.He sat back in his chair and watched her closely.Yet, there was just a slight tint in her skin, he thought.Perhaps the report that she was a mulatto was not wholly unfounded,
although the strain must have been greatly mixed.He wanted to bend over and take it in his own.Then he suddenly remembered what the Beaubien had once told him--that
she always seemed to be a better woman in this girl's presence.Could he go on persecuting the
harassed woman?But he wouldn't, if--

"There!"said the girl, with what seemed to be a little sigh of
relief.She pressed a button, and handed the typewritten sheets to the
boy who responded.Then, turning to Ames:

"You've come to apologize, haven't you?Well, he certainly had not had any such intention when he
came in.In fact, he knew not just why he was there."You see, Congressman Wales didn't vote for the unaltered schedule.And so everything's all right, isn't it?""No vote has been taken," he said, a dull anger
rising within him."Oh, you are mistaken," replied the girl."The bill was voted out of
committee an hour ago.Here's the wire,
showing the alterations made.Ames read the message, and handed it back.Beyond the clouding of his
features he gave no indication of his feelings."So, you see," continued the girl, "that incident is closed--for all
time, isn't it?"Then:

"Rather odd, isn't it?"he commented, turning quite away from that
subject, and glancing about, "that one with the high ideals you
profess should be doing newspaper work.""There is nothing so
practical as the ideal, for the ideal is the only reality.""Well, just what, may I ask, are you trying to do here?""Run a newspaper on a basis of _practical_ Christianity," she
answered, her eyes dancing."Just as all business will have to be
conducted some day."she said, "to the carnal mind."The laughter abruptly ceased, and he looked keenly at her.But there
was no trace of malice in her fair face as she steadily returned the
look.Well, I'll wager you won't get a dollar back on your investment
for years."We are not measuring our profits
in money!""And your investment--let's see," he mused, trying to draw her out."You've put into this thing a couple of hundred thousand, eh?""I'll tell you," she said, "because money is the only
measure you have for estimating the worth of our project.Hitt has
put more than that amount already into the Express."Quite a little for you people to lose, eh?""You will have to change your tone if you remain here, Mr.You who owe your fellow-men what you can
never, never repay?Ames, there is no man in this whole wide
world, I think, who is so terribly, hopelessly in debt as you!"Why, I don't owe a dollar to any man!"she queried, bending a little closer to him."You do not owe
Madam Beaubien the money you are daily filching from her?Gannette the money and freedom of which you robbed him?You do not owe anything to the thousands of miners and mill hands who
have given, and still give, their lives for you?You do not owe for
the life which you took from Mrs.You do not owe for
the souls which you have debauched in your black career?For the human
wreckage which lies strewn in your wake?Haynerd
for the Social Era which you stole from him?"Ames remained rigid and quiet while the girl spoke.And when she had
finished, and they sat looking squarely into each other's eyes, the
silence was like that which comes between the sharp click of lightning
and the crash of thunder which follows.If it had been a man who thus
addressed him, Ames would have hurled him to the floor and trampled
him.As it was, he rose slowly, like a black storm-cloud mounting
above the horizon, and stood over the girl.She looked up into his face dauntlessly and smiled."Sit down," she
quietly said.Don't threaten, please," she
continued."It wouldn't do any good, for I am not a bit afraid of you.A faint smile began to play about Ames's mouth.Then he twitched his
shoulders slightly."I--I got up," he said, with an assumption of
nonchalance, "to--to read that--ah, that motto over there on the
wall."He went slowly to it and, stooping, read aloud:

               "Lift up the weak, and cheer the strong,
               Defend the truth, combat the wrong!You'll find no scepter like the pen
               To hold and sway the hearts of men.""That was written by your Eugene Field," offered the girl."Now read
the one on the opposite side.It is your _Tekel Upharsin_."He went to the one she indicated, and read the spiritual admonition
from Bryant:

          "Leave the vain, low strife
          That makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power--
          The passions and the cares that wither life,
          And waste its little hour.""Now," continued the girl, "that is only a suggestion to you of the
real handwriting on the wall.I put it there purposely, knowing that
some day you would come in here and read it."Ames turned and looked at her in dumb wonder, as if she were some
uncanny creature, possessed of occult powers.Then the significance of
her words trickled through the portals of his thought."You mean, I suppose," he said, "that if I am not persuaded by the
second motto I shall feel the force of the first, as it sways you,
eh?"Ames," she replied steadily, "that the world is entering
upon a new era of thought, and that your carnal views and methods
belong to a day that is past.This century has no place for them; it
wearies of the things you represent; you are the epitome of that evil
which must have its little hour of night before the reality dawns.""Am I to understand," he
asked, "that the Express, under its new management, is about to turn
muck-raker, and shovel mud at us men of wealth?""We are not considering the Express now, Mr."It
is I alone who am warning you.""Do Hitt and Haynerd bring against me the charges which you voiced a
moment ago?And do you intend to make the columns of your paper spicy
with your comments on my character and methods?I verily believe you
are declaring war!""We are in the business of declaring truth, Mr.It will not shield you when
you are the willing tool of evil, nor will it condone your methods at
any price."Very well," he replied with a bantering smile."I came over
here this noon to get the policy of your paper.Ames," she returned, "is the challenge which evil
always finds in good."I like a good enemy, and an honest one.Who's your general, Hitt or Haynerd?"Then he recovered himself, and
laughed."Do you know," he said, bending close to her, "I admire you _very_
much.Now let's see if we can't get
together on terms of peace.The world hasn't used you right, and I
don't blame you for being at odds with it.I've wanted to talk with
you about this for some time.The pin-headed society hens got jealous
and tried to kill you.But, if you'll just say the word, I'll set you
right up on the very pinnacle of social prestige here.I'll take you
by the hand and lead you down through the whole crowd of 'em, and
knock 'em over right and left!I'll make you the leading woman of the
city; I'll back the Express; we'll make it the biggest newspaper in
the country; I'll make you and your friends rich and powerful; I'll
put you in the place that is rightfully yours, eh?He was bending ever nearer, and his hand closed over hers when he
concluded.His eyes were looking eagerly into her face, and a smile,
winning, enticing, full of meaning, played about his lips.Carmen returned his smile, but withdrew her hand."I'll join you," she
said, "on one condition.""Go; sell that thou hast; and give to the poor.Then come, take up the
cross, and follow--my leader."He straightened up, and a sneer curled his lips."I suppose," he
coarsely insinuated, "that you think you now have material for an
illuminating essay on my conversation."The man's facial muscles twitched slightly under the sting, but he
retained his outward composure."My dear girl," he said, "it probably
has not occurred to you that the world regards the Express as utterly
without excuse for existence.It says, and truly, that a wishy-washy
sheet such as it, with its devitalized, strained, and bolted reports
of the world's vivid happenings, deserves to go under from sheer lack
of interest.The experiment has been tried before, and has signally
failed.But, say the word,
and--"

"And your money, as well as your business ideals, will be ours?"Ames," she said, "you have no ideals.No man who amasses millions
by taking advantage of the world's inhuman and pernicious social
system can have ideals worthy of the name.To apply your methods, your
thought, to the Express would result in sinking its moral tone into
the dust.As for your money--"

"Commit suicide, then!"cried the man, yielding to his rising anger."Let the Express go down, carrying you and your spineless associates
with it!But, remember, you will be the sole cause of its ruin, and
theirs!"Carmen rose quietly and opened the office door."Your half hour is up,
Mr.Ames," she said, glancing at the little clock on her desk; "and I
must return to my work."For a moment the huge man stood looking down darkling upon the girl.He would have given his soul if he could have clasped that slender
form in his arms!A sudden impulse assailed him, and bade him fall
upon his knees before her, and ask her forgiveness and guidance.She
stood waiting--perhaps just for that, and always with that same smile
into which no one had ever yet read aught but limitless love.Carmen hastened to answer the call.Yes--yes--the cotton schedule was reported out
quite changed--yes, an hour ago!"*       *       *       *       *

"Dearie," said the Beaubien at evening, as Carmen seated herself in
that woman's lap and wound her arms about her neck, "I am afraid for
you.""Well, mother dearest," replied the girl, giving her a tighter
squeeze, "that is a sheer waste of time.If you haven't anything more
to occupy you than fear, you'd better come down to the office, and
I'll set you to work.""But--you have defied him--as he says, declared war--"

"No, dearest, not that.It is the carnal mind, using him as a channel,
that has declared war against good.But evil is not power; nor has it
been given power by God.My one thought is this: Am I doing that which
will result in the greatest good to the greatest number?Not as evil would
want to be served, but as good.If my mental attitude is right, then
God's law becomes operative in all that I do, and I am protected."I know, dearie, but--there's the telephone!Oh, I do hope they don't
want you!"Carmen answered the call, and returned with the announcement that
Haynerd was in distress."Sidney Ames is--not there," she said.Now don't worry,
dearest; I--I won't go alone."A moment later she gave the
Beaubien a kiss, and hurried out into the night.In half an hour she
stood at Haynerd's desk."Here I
am, tied down, depending on Sid, and he's drunk!"Haynerd looked up at her, and hesitated."Mass meeting, over on the
East Side.Here's the address," taking up a slip of paper."Open
meeting, I'm told; but I suspect it's an I. W. W. affair.he
said, replying to a telephone call.The Ames mills at
Avon closed down this afternoon?He hung up the receiver and turned to Carmen."That's what this
meeting is about," he said significantly."Four thousand hands
suddenly thrown out at the Avon mills.Sidney Ames slouched into the editor's office and sank heavily into a
chair."Look here," he said, in
sudden desperation, "that fellow's got to be sobered up, now!Or
else--"

Another call came, this time from the Beaubien.Haynerd eagerly gave the
address over the 'phone, and bade him start at once."Now," he said, nodding at Carmen, and jerking his thumb over his
shoulder toward the intoxicated reporter, "it's up to you."Carmen rose at once and went to the lad."Come, Sidney," she said,
taking his hand.The boy roused dully, and shuffled stupidly after the girl into her
own little office.Carmen switched on the lights and closed the door.Then she went to
the limp, emaciated form crumpled up in a chair, and sat down beside
it."Sidney," she said, taking his hand, "there is but one habit--the
habit of righteousness.That is the habit that you are going to wear
now."Outside, the typewriters clicked, the telephones tinkled, and the
linotypes snapped.There were quick orders; men came and went
hurriedly; but there was no noise, no confusion.Haynerd toiled like a
beaver; but his whole heart was in his work.Carmen's little room voiced the sole discordant note that night.And
as the girl sat there, holding the damp hand of the poor victim, she
thanked her God that the lad's true individuality was His pure
thought of him.*       *       *       *       *

At dawn Sidney Ames awoke.A rosy-tinted glow lay over the little
room, and the quiet form at his side seemed an ethereal presence.A
gentle pressure from the hand that still clasped his brought a return
of his earthly sense, and he roused up.The gentle voice sounded to him like distant music."I--you--you brought me in here last night--but--" His hands closed
about the little one that lay in his grasp."You--haven't sat
here--with me--all night?"With a low moan the boy buried his face in her arms, and burst into a
flood of bitter tears."It isn't real, Sidney," she whispered, twining an arm about his neck.For some moments the lad sobbed out his shame and misery.Carmen
stroked his fair hair, and drew him closer to her, while tears of love
and pity coursed down her own cheeks.he cried,
struggling to his feet, while his eyes shone with a wild light.He started for the door, but Carmen darted past him and stood with her
back against it, facing him.she cried, holding her
hands against him._God reigns
here!_"

She turned the lock as he hesitated; then took his arm and led him,
trembling and shivering, back to his chair."We are going to meet this, Sidney, you and I," she whispered, bending
over the shaking form.The suffering lad shook his head and buried his face in his hands."You can't," he moaned; "you can't--I'm _gone!_" His voice died into a
tremble of hopeless despair, of utter surrender.She had faced many trying situations in her brief
life-experience; but, though she met it with dauntless courage and
knew its source, the insidious suggestion now persisted that the eyes
of her people were upon her, and that by this would stand or fall
their faith.Aye, the world was watching her now, keen-eyed and
critical.Would she give it cause to say she could not prove her faith
by her works?And then came the divine message that bade her "Know that I am
God!"--that bade her know that responsibility lay not upon her
shoulders, but upon the Christ for whom she was now called to
witness.To see, or permit the world to see, this mountainous error,
this heaped-up evil, as real and having power, meant a denial of the
Christ and utter defeat.It meant a weary retracing of her own steps,
and a long night of spiritual darkness to those whose eyes had been
upon her."Sidney," she said, turning to the sunken boy at her side, "you are
right, the old man _is_ gone.And now we are going to create 'new
heavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered nor
come into mind'--as thought.Underneath are the everlasting arms, and
you have sunk down, down, down, until at last you rest upon them, and
you find that you haven't sunk at all, and that you couldn't possibly
get away from that infinite Love that is always drawing you to
itself!"She put her arm again about the lad, and drew him toward her."Listen,
Sidney dear, I am standing with you--and with me is omnipotent God!His arm is not shortened, that it can not save you from the pit of
spiritual oblivion into which human thought would seem to make you
think you had fallen, engulfed by the senses."The boy raised his head and looked at her through his bloodshot eyes.he whispered hoarsely; "you don't understand--"

"It is just because I _do_ understand, Sidney, that I am able to help
you," she interrupted quickly."It--it isn't only whiskey--it's--" his head sank again--"it's--morphine!"It's got the false thought that seems to call itself 'you,'" she
said.We'll
cling to them no longer, but shake them off for good.For good, I
said, Sidney--and that means, for _God_!"If there were a God, I shouldn't be
where I am now.""Then I will know it for you," she softly answered."And you are now
right where you belong, in Him.My
parents didn't teach it to their children.And when I tried to learn,
my father kicked me into the street!""Then, Sidney, I'll teach you.For I am in the world just to show what
love will do.""My father--it's his fault--all his fault!"cried the boy, flaring up
and struggling to rise.It's his fault
that I'm a sot and a drug fiend!""It is hate, Sidney, that manifests in slavery, in sodden brains, and
shaking nerves.You don't hate your father; the hate is against your
thought of him; and that thought is all wrong."I used to drink--some, when I lived at home," the boy went on, still
dwelling on the thoughts that held him chained."But he could have
saved me.And then I fell in love--I thought it was love, but it
wasn't.The woman was--she was years older than I. When she left the
city, I followed her.And when I found out what she was, and came back
home, my father threw me out--cut me off--God!""Never mind, Sidney," the girl whispered.But
she realized that the boy must voice the thoughts that were tearing
his very soul, and she suffered him, for it uncovered to her the
hidden sources of his awful malady."And then I drank, drank, drank!""And I lay in the
gutters, and in brothels, and--then, one day, Carlson told me to come
and work for him.And so I went to a
doctor, and he--God curse him!--he injected morphine into my arm to
sober me.And that taught me that I could drink all I wanted to, and
sober up on morphine.But then I learned--I found--"

He stopped, and began to fumble in his pockets.His eyes became wilder
as he searched.He caught her wrist and twisted
it painfully."I am not
afraid to see evil seem to have power!"Then aloud: "I know what you
are searching for, Sidney.Listen, and I will give it
to you.It is in love--right here--the Christ-principle, that is bigger far
than the demons that seem to tear you!I have _all_ power from God,
and you, evil, _can not touch me_!"The boy started at the ringing voice, and loosened his grasp.Then he
sank back into his chair, shaking as with palsy.We
don't have to struggle--we don't have to fight--we only have to
_know_.All that you are wrestling with is the world-wide belief that
there is a power apart from God!_There is none!_ Any claim that there
is such a power is a lie!There is no power or intelligence in whiskey or morphine!The Christ-principle will save you!There
is nothing beyond its reach, not even your problem!"It is a problem, that's all, Sidney," she went on, as he became
calmer.Will you put yourself in my charge,
in my care, and let me meet it for you?"She bent over him and looked
eagerly into his drawn face."We are not going to fight," she continued."We are not going to
resist evil as the world does, and so make it real.I know, dear, just
how pressing your need is.I know how
awfully real it seems to you.But trust me, as I trust the Christ.For a few moments they sat together, hand in hand."I am going to
take you home with me.I am going to keep you right with me, right
under my thought.I'm going to be the mirror, constantly with you,
that reflects infinite love to you every moment.Don't think of anything
else now, excepting that God has your hand and is leading you."She took his arm and drew him, unresisting, yet uncomprehending, to
the door.As she opened it, she looked up into his face and smiled.she cried, shifting her grasp to his hand.And I shall not turn you over to yourself again until the problem
is solved!"Hitt met them as they came out of the room."Well," he said, "I've
kept Madam Beaubien informed as well as I could."We'll be back at three--perhaps."*       *       *       *       *

But at three that afternoon the Beaubien telephoned to Hitt that
Carmen would not be down."She will not leave the boy," the woman said."She holds him--I don't
know how.And I know he is trying desperately to help her.But--I
never saw any one stand as she does!Lewis is here, but he doesn't
interfere.We're going to put a bed in his room, and Sidney will sleep
there.Haynerd stormed; but the tempest was all on the surface."I know, I
know," he said, in reply to Hitt's explanation."That boy's life is
more to her than a million newspapers, or anything else in the
universe just at present.The devil can't look her in the
face!I--I wish I were--What are you standing there for?In the little Beaubien cottage that afternoon the angry waves of human
fear, of human craving, of hatred, wrath, and utter misery mounted
heaven-high, and fell again.As the
night-shadows gathered, Sidney Ames, racked and exhausted, fell into a
deep sleep.Then Carmen left his bedside and went into the little
parlor, where sat the Beaubien and Father Waite."Here," she said, handing a hypodermic needle and a vial of tablets to
the latter.And now," she continued, "you must
work with me, and stand--firm!Sidney's enemies are those of his own
mental household.We have got to
uproot from his consciousness the thought that alcohol and drugs are a
power.Hatred and self-condemnation, as well as self-love, voiced in a
sense of injury, are other mental enemies that have got to be driven
out, too.It is all mental, every
bit of it!You have got to know that, and stand with me.We are going
to prove the Christ-principle omnipotent with respect to these seeming
things."But," she added, after a moment's pause, "you must not watch this
error so closely that it can't get away.For if
you do, you make a reality of it--and then, well--"

"The case is in your hands, Carmen," said Father Waite gently."We
know that Jesus would cure this boy instantly, if he were here--"

"Well--the Christ _is_ here!""Put
away your 'ifs' and 'buts.'"And these," he said, holding out the
needle and vial, "shall we have further use for them?""It will be given us what we are to do and say," she returned.CHAPTER 9


Four weeks from that crisp morning when Carmen led the bewildered,
stupified lad to her home, she and Sidney sat out upon the little
porch of the cottage, drinking in the glories of the winter sun.January was but half spent, and the lad and girl were making the most
of the sudden thaw before the colder weather which had been predicted
might be upon them.What these intervening weeks had been to Carmen, none might have
guessed as she sat there with the sunlight filtering in streamlets of
gold through her brown hair.But their meaning to the boy might have
been read with ease in the thin, white face, turned so constantly
toward his fair companion.They were deeply, legibly written there,
those black nights, when he would dash out into the hall, determined
to break through the windows of the nearest dram shop and drink,
drink, drink, until the red liquor burst from his eyes, his mouth, his
nostrils!Those ghastly nights, when Carmen would stand before him,
her arms outspread across the door, and beat back the roaring devils
within him!Those long days of agonized desire for the vicious drug
which had sapped his manhood!Those fell hours, when low curses poured
from his burning lips upon her and upon all mankind!Those cold,
freezing sweats, and the dry, cracking fever!Those hours when, with
Carmen always by his side, he tramped mile after mile through drifts
and ice, until he dropped at length from sheer exhaustion, only to
awake, hours later, to find that the girl had brought him home, safe,
unharmed!--

And then, oh, the "Peace, be still!"which he began to hear, faint at
first, but growing in volume, until, at last, it became a mighty,
thunderous command, before which the demons paled and slunk away,
never to return!Oh, the tears of agony that had given way to tears of
joy, of thanksgiving!Oh, the weakness that had been his strength!And, oh, the devotion of this fair girl--aye, and of her associates,
too--but all through her!Had she proved her God before the eyes of
the world?Day after day, clad in the impenetrable armor
of her love, she had stood at this struggling lad's side, meeting the
arrows of death with her shield of truth!Night after night she had
sat by his couch, her hand crushed in his desperate grasp, flouting
the terror that stalked before his delirious gaze!What work she had
done in those long weeks, none would ever know; but the boy himself
knew that he had emerged from the valley of the shadow of death with a
new mind, and that she had walked with him all the dark, cloud-hung
way.As they sat there in the bright sunlight that morning, their thought
was busy with the boy's future.Old plans, old ambitions, had seemed
to lift with the lifting of the mortal curse which had rested upon
him, and upward through the ashes of the past a tender flower of hope
was pushing its way.The last tie which
bound him to his family had been severed by his own father two weeks
before, when the shadow of death fell athwart his mother's brilliant
path.J. Wilton Ames, delicate in health when recalled from
abroad, and still suffering from the fatigue of the deadly social
warfare which had preceded her sudden flight from her husband's
consuming wrath, had failed to rally from the indisposition which
seized her on the night of the grand Ames reception.For days she
slowly faded, and then went quickly down under a sharp, withering
attack of pneumonia.A few brief weeks after the formal opening of the
Ames palace its mistress had sighed away her blasted hopes, her vain
desires, her petty schemes of human conquest and revenge, and had gone
to face anew her problems on another plane of mortal thought.It was
rumored by the servants that, in her last hours, when she heard the
rustle of the death angel's wings beside her, a great terror had
stricken her, and she had called wildly for that son whom she had
never cared to know.It was whispered that she had begged of her
husband to seek the lad and lead him home; that she had pleaded with
him to strive, with the boy, to find the better things of life; that
she had begged him to warn and be warned of her present sufferings, as
she lay there, stripped of every earthly aid, impoverished in heart,
in soul, in mind, with her hands dusty and begrimed with the ashes of
this life's mocking spoils.What truth lay hidden in her mad ravings about the parentage of
Carmen, and her confused, muttered references to Monsignor Lafelle, no
one knew.But of those who stood about her bedside there was none who
could gainsay the awed whisperings of the servants that this haughty
leader of the great city's aristocracy had passed from this life into
the darkness beyond in pitiable misery and terror.The news of his mother's death had come at a time when the boy was
wild with delirium, at an hour when Waite, and Hitt, and Carmen stood
with him in his room and strove to close their ears against the
shrieking of the demon that was tearing him.Hitt at once called up
Willett, and asked for instructions.A few minutes later came the
message that the Ames house was forever barred against the wayward
son.And it was not until this bright winter morning, when the lad
again sat clothed and in his right mind, that Carmen had gently broken
the news to him."I never knew her," the boy had said at length, rousing from his
meditations."Few of the rich people's children know their parents.I
was brought up by nurses and tutors.I never knew what it was to put
my arms around my mother, and kiss her.And often I would plan to surprise her by suddenly running into her
arms and embracing her.But then, when I would see her, she was always
so far away, so cold, so beautifully dressed.And she seldom spoke to
me, or to Kathleen, until we were grown up.And by that time I was
running wild.And then--then--"

"There!"admonished Carmen, reaching over and taking his hand."That's
in our little private cemetery, you know.The old error is dead, and
we are not going to dig it up and rehearse it, are we?""I'm like a little baby," he said sadly."I'm just
beginning to live.And you are my mother, the only one I've ever
known.""Let me be your sister," she said."We are so
near of an age, you know.""You are my angel," he murmured."What have I told you
so often that Jesus said?'Of mine own self I can do nothing.'It was--" her voice sank to a whisper--"it was the
Christ-principle.It worked through him as a channel; and it worked
through me.""You're going to teach me all about that," he said, again pressing her
hand to his lips."You won't cast me adrift yet, will you, little
sister?"Why, you're still mine, you
know!I haven't given you back to yourself yet, have I?But now let's
talk about your work.If you want to write, you are going to, and you
are going to write _right_.""Back to the Express," she said lightly."I haven't written a word for
it now for a month.And how dear, funny old Ned has scolded!""You--you dropped everything--your work--all--for a poor, worthless
hulk like me," he sighed."Sidney dear," the girl replied.Everything I do is '_as unto Him_.'I would have done the same for
anybody, whether I knew the person or not.I saw, not you, but the
human need--oh, such a need!And the Christ-principle made me a human
channel for meeting it, that is all.Drop my work, and my own
interests!Why, Sidney, what is anything compared with meeting human
needs?Didn't Jesus drop everything and hurry out to meet the sick and
the suffering?Was money-making, or society, or personal desire, or
worldly pleasure anything to him when he saw a need?You don't seem to
understand that this is what I am here for--to show what love will
do.""I--I guess I know only the world's idea of love.""And that is love's counterfeit, self-love, sentimentalism,
sex-mesmerism, and all that," she added."But now, back to your work
again.You're going to write, write, write!My, but the world is
hungry for _real_ literature!Your yearning to meet that need is a
sign of your ability to do it.But, remember, everything that comes to
you comes from within.You are, in fact, a miner; and your mine is
your mind; and that is unlimited, for God is the only mind, infinite
and omnipresent.We
never fear a real thing; we fear only our false thoughts of things.Always those thoughts are absolutely wrong, and we wake up and find
that we were fearing only fear-thoughts themselves.Now destroy the chains of fear which limit your thought,
and God will issue!"Well," without waiting for his reply, "now you have reached that
plane of thought where you don't really care for what the world has to
offer you.You have ceased to want to be rich, or famous.You are not
afraid to be obscure and poor.You have learned, at least in part,
that the real business of this life lies in seeking good, in
manifesting and expressing it in every walk, and in reflecting it
constantly to your fellow-men.Having learned that, you are ready to
live.Remember, there is no luck, no such thing as chance.The cause
of everything that can possibly come to you lies within yourself.The thought that you allow to enter
your mentality and become active there, later becomes externalized.Be, oh, so careful, then, about your thought, and the basis upon which
it rests!For, in your writing, you have no right to inflict false
thought upon your credulous fellow-mortals.""But," he replied, "we are told that in literature we must deal with
human realities, and with things as they are.The human mind exists,
and has to be dealt with.""The human mind does not exist, Sidney, except as supposition.The world still awaits the one who will show
it things as they _really_ are.Human realities, so-called, are the
horrible, ghastly unrealities of carnal thought, without any basis of
the divine Christ-principle.I know, we are told that the great books
of the world are those which preserve and interpret its life.is
it true greatness to detail, over and over again in endless recital,
the carnal motives of the human mind, its passions and errors, its
awful mesmerism, its final doom?Yes, perhaps, on one condition: that,
like a true critic, you picture human concepts only to show their
unreality, their nothingness, and to show how they may be overcome.""But most books--"

"Ah, yes, most books are written only to amuse the dispirited human
mind for a brief hour, to make it forget for a moment its troubles.They are literary narcotics; they are sops to jaded appetites, that's
all.A book, for example, that pictures an injured man discovering a
great treasure, and then using it to carry out his schemes of
revenge--well, what influence for good has such a work?It is only a
stimulus to evil, Sidney.But had it shown him using that great wealth
to bless his persecutors and turn them from their mesmerism to real
life and good--"

"Such things don't happen in this world, Carmen.""But they could, and should, Sidney dear.Then will come the new literature, the literature of _good_!And it
will make people think, rather than relieve them from the ennui of
solid thought, as our present novels do.The intellectual palate then
will find only insipidity in such books as pour from our presses now.The ability to converse glibly about authors who wallow in human
unrealities will then no longer be considered the hall-mark of
culture.Culture in that day will be conformity to truth.""Little sister," he said,
"you are a beautiful idealist.""But," came her quick reply, "are you not a living illustration of the
practicability of my idealism, Sidney?"The boy choked, and tears filled his eyes.Carmen stole an arm about
him."The most practical man who ever lived, Sidney dear, was Jesus.He had ideas that differed very
radically from other people's, but he did not hide them for fear of
giving offense.He was not afraid to shock people with the truth about
themselves.He tore down, yes; but he then reconstructed, and on a
foundation of demonstrable truth.He was not afraid to defy the
Rabbis, the learned, and the puffed-up.He did not bow abjectly before
the mandarins and pedagogues.Had he done so, and given the people
what they wanted and were accustomed to, they would have made him a
king--and his mission would have been a dead failure!""And for that they slew him," returned the boy."It is the cowardly fear of slaughter, Sidney, that keeps people from
coming out and standing for what they know to be right to-day.You are
not one of those cravens.""But the people who do that, Carmen, are called demagogues and
muck-rakers!""And the muck-rakers, Sidney, have made a sorry mess,
haven't they?They destroy without ruth, but seldom, if ever, put
forth a sane suggestion for the betterment of conditions.They traffic
in sensationalism, carping criticism, and abuse.'To find fault,' said
Demosthenes, 'is easy, and in every man's power; but to point out the
proper remedy is the proof of a wise counselor.'The remedy which I
point out, Sidney, is the Christ-principle; and all I ask is that
mankind seek to demonstrate it, even as Jesus bade us do.He was a
success, Sidney, the greatest success the world has ever known.Because he followed ideals with utter loyalty--because he voiced
truth without fear--because he made his business the service of
humanity.He took his work seriously, not for money, not for human
preferment, but for mankind.And his work bears the stamp of
eternity.""You're _not_ afraid, Sidney!""Oh, why
does the human mind always look for and expect that which it does not
want to see come or happen!"The boy laughed heartily at the quick sally of her delightfully
quotidian thought."You didn't let me finish," he said."I was going
to say that I'm afraid if I write and speak only of spiritual things I
shall not be understood by the world, nor even given a hearing.""Well, don't use that word 'afraid.'how the human mind clings to
everything, even words, that express its chief bogy, fear."And yet, has anything, written or
spoken, ever endured as his spiritual teachings?The present-day novel
or work of fiction is as fleeting as the human thought it attempts to
crystallize.Of the millions of books published, a handful endure.Those are they which illustrate the triumph of good over evil in human
thought.And the greatest of such books is the Bible.""Well, I'm hunting for a subject now."It will drive you to the task of transcribing it.Sidney--perhaps I can give you the subject!Perhaps I am the channel for this, too!""Well," bending over closer to her,
"what is it, little sister?"The girl looked out over the dripping shrubs and the soft snow.She saw a man, a priest, she knew not
where, but delving, plodding, digging for the truth which the human
mind has buried under centuries and centuries of material _debris_.She saw him, patiently bearing his man-made burden, striving to shield
a tender, abandoned girl, and to transfer to her his own great worldly
knowledge, but without its dross.She saw the mighty sacrifice, when
the man tore her from himself, and thrust her out beyond the awful
danger in which he dwelt.It was love--aye, the love that alone makes men great, the love
that lays down human life in self-immolating service.I will tell
you the whole beautiful story.It is an illustration of the way love
works through human channels.And perhaps--perhaps, some day, the book
may reach him--yes, some day.And it will tell him--oh, Sidney, it
will tell him that I know, and that I love him, love him, love him!"*       *       *       *       *

In the office of the manager of the Express three heads were close
together that morning, and three faces bore outward evidence of the
serious thought within."Miss Wall tells me, Ned," Hitt was saying, "that her father used to
be associated with Ames, and that, at his demise, he left his estate,
badly entangled, for Ames to settle.Now it transpires that Ames has
been cunning enough to permit Miss Wall to draw upon his bank almost
without limit, he making up any deficit with his own personal notes.""I think I see the shadow of his fine hand!""And now," resumed Hitt, "she is given to understand that Ames has
been obliged by the bank examiner to withdraw his personal notes as
security for her deficits, and that the revenue from her estate must
be allowed to accrue to the benefit of the Ames bank until such time
as all obligations are met.""In other words, Elizabeth is simply
cut off!"And now, another thing: Madam Beaubien's lawyer called on
her to-day, and informed her that Hood had gone into court and secured
an injunction, tying up all revenue from her estate until it can be
unraveled."Ames is out to do up
the Express, eh?""There is no doubt of it, Ned," returned Hitt seriously."And to
utterly ruin all connected with it.""Then, by God, we'll fight him to the last ditch!""I think you forget, Ned, that we have a lady with us," nodding toward
Miss Wall, "and that you are seriously trying to reform, for Carmen's
sake.""I beg your pardon, Elizabeth," said Haynerd meekly."I really am
trying to be decent, you know.But when I think of Ames it's like a
red rag to a bull!""Of course," Hitt continued, "oil still flows from our paternal wells.But in order to raise money at once I shall be obliged either to sell
my oil holdings or mortgage them.They have got to take care of us all
now, including Madam Beaubien."There's another anomaly: while Ames is trying to
ruin us, that girl is saving his son."I--I beg your pardon,
Elizabeth.The fact is, either you or I will have to retire from this
meeting, for I'm getting mad.I like to hear your sulphurous
language to-day.It helps to express my own feelings," replied the
woman."The circulation of the Express," Hitt went on, "is entirely
artificial.Our expense is tremendous, and our revenue slight.And
still Carmen insists on branching out and putting into practical form
her big ideas.Limitation is a word that is not in her vocabulary!""Hitt, can't we fight Ames with his own fire?"Ames is very cunning," answered Hitt."When he learned that the
cotton schedule had been altered in the Ways and Means Committee, he
promptly closed down his Avon mills.Then
he resumed, but on half time.I presume
he will later return to full time, but with a reduced scale of wages.This
way: he will force a strike at Avon--a February strike--four thousand
hands out in the cold.Meantime, he'll influence every other spinner
in the country to do likewise.Now, can
Congress stand up against that sort of argument?And, besides, he will
grease the palms of a large number of our dignified statesmen, you may
be sure!"Hitt," said Miss Wall, "I suggest that you send Carmen to Avon at
once.I know of no one who can get to the bottom of things as she can.Let her collect the facts regarding the situation down there, and
then--"

"Send her first to Washington!""Have her hang
around the lobbies of the Capitol for a while, and meet a lot of those
old sap-heads.What information she won't succeed in worming out of
them isn't in 'em, that's all!""But," objected Hitt, "if she knew that we would use her information
for a personal attack upon Ames, she'd leave us.""There's no objection to her getting the facts, anyway, is there?"demanded Haynerd, waxing hot again.I'll put a mortgage on my Ohio holdings at once.""I don't think I would be afraid," suggested Miss Wall."We might not
use the information Carmen may collect in Avon or Washington, but
something, I am sure, is bound to come out of it.Something always
comes out of what she does."All well and good," put in Haynerd."And yet, if she finds anybody
down there who needs help, even the President himself, she'll throw
the Express to the winds, just as she did in Sidney's case."No, that's true, Ned, for while we preach she's off somewhere
practicing.We evolve great truths, and she applies and demonstrates
them.But she has saved Sidney--her Christ did it through her.And she
has given the lad to us, a future valuable man.""Sure--if we are to _have_ any future," growled Ned."See here," retorted Hitt, brindling, "have we in our numerous
gatherings at Madam Beaubien's spoken truth or nonsense?If you
believe our report, then accept and apply it.Now who's to go to Avon
with Carmen?"Why, if those Magyars down there
discovered he was Ames's son, they'd eat him alive!"Then, turning to his
companions:

"Waite says he wants a meeting to-night.He'd like to report on his
research work.No
telling when we may get together again, if the girl--" He became
suddenly silent, and sat some time looking vacantly out through the
window."She goes to Avon to-morrow," he abruptly announced, "alone."His
thought had been dwelling on that'something not ourselves' which he
knew was shielding and sustaining the girl.CHAPTER 10


"We have now arrived at a subject whose interest and significance for
us are incalculable," said Father Waite, standing before the little
group which had assembled in their usual meeting place in the first
hours of the morning, for only at that time could Hitt and Haynerd
leave the Express."We have met to discuss briefly the meaning of that
marvelous record of a whole nation's search for God, the Bible.As
have been men's changing concepts of that'something not ourselves
that makes for righteousness,' so have been individuals, tribes, and
nations.The Bible records the development of these concepts in
Israel's thought; it records the unquenchable longings of that people
for truth; it records their prophetic vision, their sacred songs,
their philosophy, their dreams, and their aspirations.To most of us
the Bible has long been a work of profound mystery, cryptical,
undecipherable.And largely, I now believe, because we were wont to
approach it with the bias of preconceived theories of literal, even
verbal, inspiration, and because we could not read into it the record
of Israel's changing idea of God, from a wrathful, consuming Lord of
human caprice and passions, to the infinite Father of love, whom Jesus
revealed as the Christ-principle, which worked through him and through
all who are gaining the true spiritual concept, as is this girl who
sits here on my right with the lad whom you have seen rescued by the
Christ from the pit of hell."His voice choked when he referred to Carmen and Sidney.But he quickly
stifled his emotion, and went on:

"In our last meeting Mr.Hitt clearly showed us how the so-called
human mind has seemed to develop as the suppositional opposite of the
mind that is God; and how through countless ages of human reckoning
that pseudo-mind has been revealing its various types, until at
length, rising ever higher in the scale of being, it revealed its
human man as a mentality whose consciousness is the suppositional
activity of false thought, and which builds, incessantly, mental
concepts out of this kind of thought and posits them within itself as
material objects, as its own body, its universe, its all.And he
showed us how, little by little, that human mind's interpretations of
the infinite mind's true ideas became better, under the divine
infiltration of truth, until at last there developed a type, now known
to us as the Jewish nation, which caught a clearer glimpse of truth,
and became conscious of that'something not ourselves' which makes
for right-thinking, and consequent correct mental concepts and
externalizations.This, then, was the starting point of our religion.These first glimpses of truth, and their interpretations, as set forth
in the writings of the early Jewish nation, constitute the nucleus of
our Bible."But were these records exact statements of truth?The
primitive human mind could only lisp its wonderful glimpses of truth
in legend and myth.And so in fable and allegory the early Israelites
sought to show the power of good over evil, and thereby stimulate a
desire for right conduct, based, of course, on right-thinking.And
thus it is that the most significant thing in their sacred records is
their many, many stories of the triumph of the spiritual over the
material.Their right-thinking
became externalized outwardly in material abundance and physical
comfort.But the people's understanding was not sufficiently great to
shield them from the temptation which material wealth and power always
constitute.The mist of
materialism spread over it.Those wonderful flashes of truth ceased to
dart across their mental horizon.Their god became a magnified concept
of the human man, who dickered with them over the construction of his
temples, and who, by covenants, bribes, and promises, induced them to
behave themselves.And at length the beautiful vision
faded quite away."Then followed four hundred human years, during which the vicissitudes
of the Hebrew nation were many and dark.But during those long
centuries there developed that world wonder, a whole nation's united
longing for a deliverer!The prophets promised a great change in their
fallen fortunes.Though
their concept of Him had grossly degenerated, yet the deliverer would
come, he _must_!In the depths of their night--in the midst of the
heaviest darkness that ever lay over the world--there arose a great
light.Through the densest ignorance of the human mind filtered the
Christ-principle, and was set forth by the channel through which it
came, the man Jesus.Had there been a conference among God, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, to debate the sending of salvation to mankind, as
recorded by the poet Milton?what a crude, materialistic
conception.Had God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son?But God _is_ Love, infinite, unchanging.And His unique Son, the
Christ-principle, available to all mankind, was 'before Abraham.'Had
a great, dimly perceived principle been demonstrated, namely, that,
if we yearn long and earnestly for the right, it comes?Had the Jewish
nation 'demonstrated' the Christ?Had their centuries of looking and
expecting resulted in a saviour being manifested to them?It was a
period in the unfolding of human thought when civilization had reached
its lowest depths.Morality had evaporated to the dregs.Rome was
become the world's harlot.A few years more, and Nero would drag his
vulpine immorality across the stage.Paganism was virtue in comparison
with the lust of men in that dark hour.And yet, in the very midst of
it, appeared the most venerated, the most beloved man in all history,
bearing the Christ-message like a flaming torch!"'Always our being is descending into us,' said Emerson.But our true
being can be none other than infinite mind's idea of itself.Our true
individuality must be the way that mind regards us.And thus it was
that Israel's true being descended, filtering in through the thick
mists of error.That true being was the deliverer, _par excellence_,
for it was the message of truth that bade men deny themselves, their
carnal selves, and know but the one God, infinite mind.That was the
grace sufficient for them, that would have solved their problems, that
would have enabled them to lay off the 'old man' and his woes and
afflictions, and put on the 'new man,' divine mind's image.But the
carnal mind sought a material kingdom.It wanted, not spirit, but
matter.It cruelly rejected the message-bearer, and sought to kill his
message by slaying him on the cross.And thereby the Jewish nation
rent itself asunder, and sank into carnal oblivion.Ah, how they have
been cursed by the crucifixion of Jesus!"Men ask to-day: Did Jesus really live?Or is he a mythical character,
like the gods of pagan Rome?Let us ask, in making our reply, how
truth comes to mankind?Then the great sayings attributed to Jesus at least came from a human
being.Let us go further: it is the common history of mankind that
truth comes to the human mind only after a period of preparation.Not
conscious preparation, necessarily, but, rather, a preparation forced
by events.The truth of a mathematical principle can not come to me
unless I am prepared to receive it.And the greatest good comes to men
only after they have learned the nothingness of the material ambitions
and aims which they have been pursuing.By its own rottenness the
world had been made fallow for truth.The awfulness of its own
exposure in its rampant, unlicensed revels, had shown as never before
the human mind's absolute nothingness--its nothingness as regards real
value, permanence, and genuine good--in that first century of our
so-called Christian era.And when the nothingness of the carnal mind
was made plain, men saw the reality of the truth, as revealed in the
Christ, back of it all.The divine message was whispered to a human
mentality.And that mentality expanded under the God-influence, until
at last it gave to the sin-weary world the Christ-principle of
salvation.Let us call that human mentality, for convenience, the man
Jesus."And now, was he born of a virgin?It
was common enough in his day for virgins to pretend to be with child
by the Holy Ghost; and so we do not criticise those who refuse to
accept the dogma of the virgin birth.But a little reflection in the
light of what we have been discussing throws a wonderful illumination
upon the question.If matter and material modes are real, then we must
at once relegate the stories of the virgin birth, the miracles, the
resurrection, and the ascension to the realm of myth.If the so-called
laws of matter are real, irrefragable laws, then we indulgently, pass
by these stories as figments of heated imaginations.But, regarding
matter as a human, mortal concept, entirely mental, and wholly subject
to the impress and influence of mind, and knowing, as we do now, that
_mental concepts change with changed thought_, we are forced to look
with more favor upon these questions which for centuries caused men to
shed their fellows' blood.Hitt pointed out in our last meeting that mortal beings are
interpretations in mortal or human mind of the infinite mind, God, and
its ideas.The most perfect human interpretation of God's greatest
idea, Man, was Christ Jesus.The _real_ selfhood of every one of us is
God's idea of us.The world calls it the
'soul,' the 'divine essence,' and the 'immortal spark.'The Christ was
the real, spiritual selfhood of the man Jesus.So the Christ is the
real selfhood of each of us.It is not
conceived and brought forth in conformity with human modes.Now was
this great fact externalized in the immaculate conception and birth?It does not grow and decay and pass away in death.It is the 'unique'
Son of God which is back of each one of us.But the world has seen it
only once in its fullness, and then through the man Jesus."Something happened in that first century of the so-called Christian
era--something of tremendous significance.It was the
birth of the Christ-idea into the human consciousness.Was the
Christ-idea virgin-born?Aye, that it was, for God, infinite Mind,
alone was its origin and parent.The speculation which has turned
about that wonderful first century event has dealt with the human
channel through which the Christ-idea flowed to mankind.But let us
see what light our deductions throw even upon that."Referring all things to the realm of the mental, where we now
know they belong, we see that man never fell, but that Israel's idea
of God and man did fall, woefully.We see that the Christ-principle
appeared among men; we see that to-day it works marvels; we must
admit that throughout the ages before Jesus it had done so; we
know now that the great things which Israel is recorded to have
done were accomplished by the Christ-principle working through
men, and that when their vision became obscured they lost the
knowledge of that principle and how to use it.History records the
working of great deeds by that same Christ-principle when it was
re-born in our first century; and we also can see how the obscuring
of the spiritual by the material in the Emperor Constantine's time
caused the loss of the Church's power to do great works.We are
forced to admit the omnipotence, immanence, and eternality of the
Christ-principle, for it is divine mind, God himself.Moses, Elisha,
Elijah, the ancient prophets, all had primitive perceptions of truth,
and all became channels for the passing of the Christ-principle to
mankind in some degree.But none of these men ever illustrated that
principle as did the man Jesus.He is the most marvelous manifestation
of God that has ever appeared among mankind; so true and exact was
the manifestation that he could tell the world that in seeing him
they were actually seeing the Father.It is quite true that many
of his great sayings were not original with him.Great truths have
been voiced, even by so-called pagans, from earliest times.But he
demonstrated and made practical the truth in these sayings.And he
exposed the nothingness of the human mental concept of matter by
healing disease, walking the waves, and in other wonderful ways.It
is true that long before his time Greek philosophers had hit upon the
theory of the nothingness of matter.Plato had said that only ideas
were real.But Jesus--or the one who brought the Christ-message--was
the clearest mentality, the cleanest human window-pane, to quote
Carmen, that ever existed.Through him the divine mind showed with
almost unobscured fullness.God's existence had been discerned and
His goodness proved from time to time by prophets and patriarchs, but
by no means to the extent that Jesus proved it.There were those
before him who had asserted that there was but one reality, and that
human consciousness was not the real self.There were even those who
believed matter to be created by the force of thought, even as in
our own day._But it remained for Jesus to make those ideas
intensely practical, even to the overcoming and dissolution of his
whole material concept of the universe and man._ And it remained
for him to show that the origin of evil is in the lie about God.It
was his mission to show that the devil was 'a man-killer from the
beginning,' because it is the supposition that there is power apart
from God.It was his life purpose to show mankind that there is
nothing in this lie to cause fear, and that it can be overcome by
overcoming the false thought which produces it.By overcoming that
thought he showed men the evanescent nature of sickness and death.And sin he showed to be a missing of the mark through lack of
understanding of what constitutes real good."Turn now again to the Bible, that fascinating record of a whole
people's search for God and their changing concept of Him.Note that,
wherever in its records evil seems to be made real, it is for the
purpose of uncovering and destroying it by the vigorous statements of
truth which you will almost invariably find standing near the
exposition of error.So evil seemed very real in the first century of
our era; but it was uncovered by the coming of Jesus.The exposure of
evil revealed the Christ, right at hand.""But," protested Haynerd, "let's get back to the question of the
virgin birth.""But let us first consider what
human birth is.""Now you are touching my lifelong
question.If I am immortal, where was I before I was born?""Of which 'I' are you speaking, Ned?""The real
'I' is God's image and likeness, His reflection.It was never born,
and never dies.And therefore it will
cease to be.The human mind makes its own laws, and calls them laws of
nature, or even God's laws.Because
God is both Father and Mother to His children, His ideas, the human
mind has decreed in its counterfeiting process that it is itself both
male and female, and that the union of these two is necessary in order
to give rise to another human mind.Do you see how it imitates the
divine in an apish sort of way?And so elements of each sex-type of
the human mind are employed in the formation of another, their
offspring.The process is wholly mental, and is one of human belief,
quite apart from the usage of the divine Mind, who'spake and it was
done,' mentally unfolding a spiritual creation.The real 'you,' Ned,
has always existed as God's idea of Himself.It will come to light as the material 'you' is put off.The
material 'you' did not exist before it was humanly born.It was
produced in supposition by the union of the parent human minds, which
themselves were reflections of the male and female characteristics of
the communal mortal mind.It thus had a definite, supposititious
beginning."And so I'm doomed to annihilation, eh?"Your mortal sense of existence, Ned, certainly is doomed to
extinction.Oh, it doubtless
will not all be destroyed when you pass through that change which we
call death.It may linger until you have passed through many such
experiences.And so it behooves you to set about getting rid of it
as soon as possible, and thus avoid the unpleasant experience of
countless death-throes.You see, Ned, an error in the premise will
appear in the conclusion.Now you are starting with the premise that
the human 'you' is real.All that you reflect of divine mind will
endure permanently, but whatever you reflect of the lie regarding
that mind will pass away.Human beings know nothing of their origin,
nor of their existence._Because there is nothing to know
about them; they are entirely supposititious!_ Paul says, in his
letter to the Romans: 'They which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God.'The birth of the children of the
flesh is wholly a human-mind process.The infant mentality thus
produced knows nothing whatsoever of itself.It has no knowledge; is
not founded on truth.It will later manifest hereditary beliefs,
showing the results of prenatal mesmerism.Then it will receive the
general assortment of human thought and opinion--very little of it
based on actual truth--which the world calls education.Then it
learns to regard itself as an individual, a separate being.And soon
it attributes its origin to God.But the prenatal error will appear
in the result.The being manifests every gradation of human thought;
it grows; it suffers and enjoys materially; it bases its very
existence upon matter; it manifests the false activity of human
thought in material consciousness; and then it externalizes its
beliefs, the consentaneous human beliefs, upon its body and in its
environment; and finally, the activity of the false thought which
constitutes its consciousness ceases--and the being dies.Yes, its
death will be due to sin, to '_hamartio_,' missing the mark.And that, Ned, is human life, so-called."Death is not in any sense a cessation of life.The being who dies
never knew what it was to live.Death is the externalization of
human, mortal beliefs, which are not based upon real knowledge, truth.Paul said: 'They that are after
the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the
spirit the things of the spirit.'In other words, mankind are striving
terribly, desperately, to keep alive a sense of material, fleshly
existence.They are foredoomed to failure,
despite the discovery of antitoxins.In the book of Job we read: 'The
spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given
me life.'Where, then, is the reality in prenatal mesmerism and the
drag of heredity?It is all supposition, all a part of the one lie,
the'man-killer.'"The change called death comes to all mortals.It is the culmination
of the human mind's sense of limitation.It does not usher them into
immortal, illimitable bliss.It but leaves them upon another seeming
plane of mortal thought, there to drag out another sense of existence,
unless they have so learned the lesson which Jesus taught as to enable
them to overcome death.Why, then, do we waste our time
in trivial things; in the heaping up of useless money; in the vain
strife for sensual pleasures?The mortal will live and die, and live
and die, until at last he is beaten into line and forced to
demonstrate the Christ-principle.Hadn't we better begin that right
here and now?Wishing to die doesn't solve our problems.Suicide only
makes us start again, worse off than before.We shall overcome death
when we have overcome sin, for the physical manifestation called death
is but the externalization in conscious experience of spiritual
death--lack of a demonstrable understanding of Life, Truth, Spirit,
which is God, unlimited good.""And the Church, Protestant and Catholic, with their ceremonies, their
Masses, and--"

"They have woefully missed the mark, Ned.But I see protest rising in our good friends, Doctor Siler and
Reverend Moore, so I will hasten on, for we have much ground still to
cover."Now, knowing that birth is a humanly mental process, is it possible
that the man Jesus was 'born of a virgin'?Quite so; but, more, _no
man ever conceived and born in the way human beings are generated has
ever begun to approach Jesus in degree of spirituality_.If he had
been born in human ways, is it likely that he would ever have
developed such intense spirituality?Well, not in a brief thirty-three
years or so!And, on the other hand, if he had come into the world in
some way other than by being born of a woman, would he have been
understandable at all to the human mind?He would have
been wholly in the realm of the mental, far above human perception.If
he had been conceived by the union of the two sexes, as is the
mortal-mind mode of generation, would he not have been too material to
have so quickly developed that spirituality which made him the light
of the world at the age of thirty-three?The theory of the virgin birth at least seems to meet the
need of a sort of middle course, whereby the man should not be too
human to be the channel for the great measure of spirituality with
which he was endowed, and yet should be human enough to be appreciable
to other human minds."Remember, the Jesus who has been reported to us must have regarded
matter as unreal, as nothingness.And
they as plainly show that he came from the Father.His whole life was
such as to render the virgin birth almost a necessity, as I see it.And from a study of the Gospels I
simply can not avoid the conclusion that his knowledge of the allness
of God rendered matter such a nonentity to him that he overcame all
material laws, overcame the world of matter, and even at the last
dematerialized his material body.It's an astonishing thought--and
yet, who can show that it is not true?There are some things that
reason insists on our accepting, despite the paucity of human
records."Waite," said Doctor Morton, "that the Gospels
according to Mark and John make no mention of the virgin birth."And I will go further: Biblical
research during the past few years seems to have established the
conclusion that Mark's Gospel antedates the others, but that prior to
it there existed a collection of sayings by Jesus, called the _Logia_.This collection of sayings seems to have been originally written in
Aramaic, the language Jesus spoke.Now Matthew Arnold tells us that
the Gospel narratives passed through at least fifty years of oral
tradition before they became fixed in the form in which we now have
them.Of course it is quite possible that the story of the virgin
birth arose during those fifty years, for we can imagine how the life
of Jesus was then discussed!Matthew and Luke alone speak of the
virgin birth.Mark's Gospel we believe to have been written by Mark
himself.And we believe that Papias, who wrote about the middle of the
second century, spoke truly when he said: 'Mark having become (or
having been) Peter's interpreter, wrote all that he remembered (or all
that Peter related) though he did not (record) in order that which
was said or done by Christ.'In other words, even as Renan admits,
the Gospel of Mark must be taken as authentically his.Now Matthew's
Gospel depends for most of its data upon Mark and the Collection of
sayings.Mark's Gospel does not mention the virgin birth; the
Collection probably did.Also, Matthew probably did not write the
Gospel attributed to him; but he almost certainly did write the
Collection of sayings, from which in part the present Gospel according
to Matthew was compiled.Luke's Gospel was undoubtedly written by the
physician Luke, Paul's companion, and depended largely for its data
upon Mark's Gospel and the Collection of Matthew.Yet we can not say
that the omission of mention in the Gospels according to Mark and John
of the virgin birth renders the story a legend, in view of our own
present great knowledge of the constitution of matter, of material
laws, and of the fact that the virgin birth is at least rendered
credible by the subsequent very extraordinary career of Jesus.Moreover, remember that our New Testament is a small book, and that it
is quite probable that a great mass of literature existed on the
subject of Jesus and his work, and that it is possible that other of
the disciples wrote treatises, perhaps many of them.How many of these
touched on the subject of the virgin birth we may never know.But this conclusion at least we must accept: the
validity of the story of the virgin birth does _not_ rest with the
four Gospels which have come down to us out of the great mass of
literature which probably once existed.Rather is the probability of
the immaculate conception a function of our present knowledge of
matter, its pseudo-laws, and the great fact that the entire life of
Jesus as reported in all the Gospels lends weight to the belief that
his birth was not in the ordinary mortal-mind manner.""And I," said Carmen, "can not see that the origin of the human
channel through which the Christ-principle flowed to mankind is of any
consequence.Jesus said that it
existed before Abraham."It has been said that the
immaculate conception was the result of Mary's realization that real
man is the son of God.Certainly Jesus
did seem to manifest some such metaphysical idea.Perhaps Mary was a
woman of tremendous force of character.Perhaps it did come to her
that her son should be the Messiah of his race.Jesus certainly did
acquire the messianic consciousness--and thereby upheaved the world.But, whatever the human mode of birth, certainly the Christ-principle
was brought into the world because of the world's tremendous need.It is only the confusing of the Christ with the
man Jesus that is so largely responsible for the weakness of orthodox
theology."But now, referring again to the Bible, let me say that the Pentateuch
is composed of a variety of documents written by various authors.We
have no positive proof that Moses had aught to do with its authorship,
although parts of it may be based on data which either he originated
or sanctioned.The books of Samuel exhibit a plurality of sources.The
book of Isaiah was written to record the sayings of at least two
persons, both men of marvelous spiritual vision.The Song of Solomon
was originally probably a Persian love-poem.The book of Job
illustrates the human-mind problem of suffering, and the utter
inadequacy of philosophy to heal it.It is a ringing protest against
conventional theology."But it is with the New Testament that we are particularly concerned,
for we believe it to contain the method of salvation from human ills.None of the original documents are extant, of course.And yet, the
most searching textual criticism goes to show that the New Testament
books as we have them to-day are genuine reproductions of the original
documents, with but very little adulteration of erroneous addition by
later hands.I have already spoken of the first
three Gospels.The book of Acts certainly was written by the author of
the third Gospel, Luke.First Peter was composed by the disciple
Peter, or was written under his sanction.The Gospel of John and the
book of First John were written by one and the same author--but
whether by the disciple John or not, I can not say.If this great
disciple did not write the Fourth Gospel, at least his influence seems
to be felt all through it.The probability is that he knew what was in
it, and approved of it, although the actual composition may have been
by another, possibly a very learned Greek.To me, the Fourth Gospel is
the most masterly work ever composed by man.The criticism that John, being a Jew, could not have composed
it, falls before the greater truth that, having become a Christian, he
was no longer a Jew.For how could he have been
other, seeing that he had lived with Jesus?"And now as to Paul, who contributes about one-third of the New
Testament.I have mentioned the letters to the Thessalonians,
Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans as indisputably his.To these we
can add, with scarcely less weight of authenticity, Colossians,
Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians.As to the Epistles to Timothy
and Titus, there is still doubt.These letters were written to the
various Churches chronologically, as I have mentioned them.It has
been said that Jesus was way over the heads of his reporters.But--and
here is the important fact for us--Paul's letters exhibit a
marvelous spiritual growth in the man, and show him at last to be the
grand master-metaphysician of the Christian era.Has it ever
occurred to you that what the Gospels tell about is almost wholly
spiritual?The material is all but neglected by their composers.Indeed, with the questions of time and place, the Gospel narrators
seemed to have been but slightly concerned.But with the delineation
of the Christ--ah!In the light of
this great truth the apparent lack of harmony in the Gospel
narratives loses significance.And how little there is in the
Gospels of theology, of institution, of organization!How trifling are
creed and doctrine, how little are Catholicism and Protestantism,
compared with the stupendous fact that God is, and that His truth,
the Christ-principle, is still here to-day and available!"And so with Paul, he was expounding the'method and secret' of the
Christ.And he first had to work up to it himself.He may have
thought, when he wrote his first letter to the Thessalonians, that the
man Jesus would come again in the skies, with great pomp and
surrounded by the Saints.But in his second letter he states plainly
that the Christ will come when the 'old man' is laid off.Not much
occasion for misunderstanding there, I think.Indeed, after Jesus so
clearly stated that the kingdom of heaven was within men, the marvel
is that there could have arisen any confusion whatsoever on the
subject of the second coming of the Christ.""I believe," interposed Reverend Moore, "that the Epistle to the
Hebrews contains statements of belief in a judgment after death, in a
heaven, a hell, and everlasting life, not wholly consistent with your
remarks.""The Epistle to the Hebrews," returned Father Waite, "was not written
by Paul, nor is it quite consistent with his letters.But, read Paul's
wonderful eighth chapter of Romans.Read his third chapter of First
Corinthians.Read all his letters in the order in which I have
mentioned them, which was as they were written, and you can not fail
to grasp his marvelous expanding perception of the Christ-principle;
the nothingness of the material concept; the impotence of the lie that
opposes God, and constitutes all evil; and the necessity of
right-thinking if one would work out his salvation from the errors
that assail mankind.Paul shows that he passed through a 'belief
period,' and that he emerged into the light of demonstrable
understanding at last.If men had followed him they never could have
fallen into the absurd theological beliefs of foreordination, infant
damnation, the resurrection of the flesh, and all the other
theological horrors and atrocities of the centuries."Yes, the Bible is, as Arnold said, based on propositions which all
can verify.The trouble is, _mankind have not tried to verify them_!They have relegated all that to the life beyond the grave.I fear a
sorry disappointment awaits them, for, even as Paul says, they will be
after the change called death only what they were before.It is like
recovering from a case of sickness, for sickness and death are alike
manifestations of mortal thought.We awake from each still human,
still with our problems before us.We must break the mesmerism of the
belief that the practical application of Jesus' teachings must be
relegated to the realm of death, or to the unattainable.We must apply
the Christ-principle, and learn to hit the mark, for sin is always
weakness, never strength."And remember this: having acquired a knowledge of the Christ, we are
bidden to acknowledge him--that is, to _act-our-knowledge_.Many of
the world's philosophers have worked out great truths.But they have
rested content with that.Many scientists, knowing that matter is
unreal, nevertheless conduct themselves _as if it constituted the one
and only real fact of existence_!Then its
opposite _can not_ be real.The human mentality holds the belief that
there is something apart from God, spirit.That belief becomes
objectified in the human mentality as matter.And within matter is
contained all evil of every sort and name.Evil is not, as the
philosophers would have us believe, a lower form of good.It is not
'good in the making.'It is always error, the direct opposite of
truth.And if truth is real and eternal, error can not be.See the
grave mistake in which Emerson became enmeshed.He said: 'There seems
to be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms.'Now
follow that out to its logical conclusion.If spirit is synonymous
with God, then God manifests Himself in both good and evil, fair and
foul, life and death--and which is good, and which bad?No, my friends, rather accept Jesus' statement
that evil is the lie, of which no man need be afraid, and which all
must and shall overcome.And the 'old man,' with all his material
concepts of nature and the universe, must and will be laid off, thus
revealing the spiritual man, the image and likeness of the one divine
Mind."Now, just a few words about miracles, the great stumbling block to
the acceptance of the Gospels.Are they, together with the entire
Gospel narrative, legendary?If so, they must have arisen during
those fifty years between Jesus and the recording of the narratives.But this very period is covered by Paul's letters, which record his
thought.And even the most relentless of Bible critics admit the
genuineness of Paul's authorship of the Epistles to the Romans,
the Corinthians, the Thessalonians, and the Galatians.If the
Gospel narratives are legends, they grew up and found acceptance in
fifty years.A pretty fair miracle in itself, when we take into
consideration the inherent incredulity of the human mind!As Dean
Farrar says: 'Who would have _invented_, who would have merely
_imagined_, things so unlike the thoughts of man as these?'"Now Paul must have been acquainted with men who had seen and known
Jesus.And we are forced to admit that Paul was a very strong, sane
man.These legends could not have grown up in his day and been
accepted by him.And as long as there were men living who had known
Jesus--and that must have been as late as the last quarter of the
first century--the true events of Jesus' life could hardly have given
way to a set of childish legends.As a matter of recorded fact, the
various Christian Churches had accepted Jesus within thirty years of
the crucifixion.And, too, the words of Paul and the Synoptists were
written at a time when the sick were still being healed and even the
dead raised by the practical application of Jesus' teachings.Hence,
miracles did not astonish them."Our own inability to perform the works attributed to Jesus is hardly
sufficient ground for denying the belief that he really did them.Certainly that the greater portion of the New
Testament was written by a few fishermen, a publican, and a tentmaker
is one of the most stupendous miracles on record!And the miracle of
miracles is Jesus Christ himself!Because Jesus is reported to have
healed the sick, raised the dead, and walked the waves, all in
opposition to material laws--the so-called laws of nature--the world
says the reports are fantastic, that they are fables, and that his
reporters were hypnotized, deluded!And yet I tell you that he did not
break a single law!He did act in defiance of the so-called testimony
of the physical senses, which has always been accepted by mankind as
law.We now know what that sense-testimony is--human, mortal thought.And because he did so,
he instantaneously healed the sick.A miracle expresses, not the
beliefs of the human mind, but the law of God, infinite mind, and
makes that law conceivable to the human mentality.God's laws are
_never_ set aside, for by very definition a law is immutable, else it
ceases to be law.But when the human mind grows out of itself
sufficiently to perceive those laws and to express them to its
fellow-minds, the result is called a miracle.Moreover, the ability to
perform miracles is but a function of spirituality.A miracle is a
sign of one's having advanced to such a degree of spirituality as to
enable him to rise above material consciousness and its limitations,
which are called laws.The consciousness that knows no evil will
perform miracles.These works
were the'signs following,' and attested their knowledge of the
allness of God.Carmen--"

"Lewis!"Carmen _knew_ that no power opposed to God
could hold Sidney.She broke a human-mind, so-called law, a limitation.She
proved God's law of harmony and holiness--wholeness--to be omnipresent
and omnipotent.And, mark me, friends, _every one of us must learn to
do likewise_!Not only must the Church obey Jesus and do the works
which he did, but every individual will have to do them himself.""His works were done for a special reason, Mr.Waite," interposed
Reverend Moore."They were to testify to his messiahship.Father Waite silently regarded the minister for some moments.Then he
went on gently:

"It seems incredible that the plain teachings of Jesus could have
been so warped and twisted as they have been by orthodox theology.Why should even the preachers themselves
condemn the one who seeks to obey Christ?Moore, the real man
is God's highest idea of Himself.The human mind makes mental concepts
of God's man.And Jesus was the grandest concept of God's idea of
Himself that the human mind has ever constructed by means of its
interpretations.One of his grandest
characteristics was his implicit obedience to his vision of the
Father.And he demanded just as implicit obedience from us.But he
bade us, again and again, _heal the sick and raise the dead_!"And Asa had his physicians to whom he turned--with the result
that he'slept with his fathers.'There is no more ironical statement
in the whole Bible than that.We turn to our physicians because we
have no faith in God._Materia medica_ physicians do _not_ heal the
sick.They sometimes succeed in causing the human mind temporarily to
substitute a belief of health for a belief of disease that is all.But Jesus and the early Christians healed by true prayer--the prayer
of affirmation, the prayer that denied reality to evil, and affirmed
the omnipotence of God.And that was done through an understanding of
God as immutable law, or principle."demanded Reverend Moore, with a note
of contempt in his voice."I prefer my own concept of God, as one who
hears our petitions, and pities us, and not as a lifeless principle!"Moore," replied Father Waite, "in that He is
'_that by which all is_.'And in order to be such He must be, as the
Bible says, 'the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.'He must be
immovable, regardless of human pleading and petition.And so true
prayer, the prayer that draws an answer, is not an objective appeal to
Him, but is an intelligent application of the Christ-principle to all
our problems and needs.Such prayer will remove mountains in
proportion to the understanding and motive back of it.And such prayer
does not seek to inform the Almighty of the state of affairs here
among men, informing Him that evil is real and rampant, and begging
that He will stoop down and remove it.It is the prayer that manifests
man's oneness with the infinite mind as its image, reflecting a
knowledge of the allness of good and the consequent unreality and
powerlessness of evil, the lie about it.It was healing by such
prayer, Mr.Moore, that the Episcopal Synod rejected only recently.Instead of doing the healing themselves by means of the principle
given them, they still plead with God, the immovable and immutable, to
do it for them, provided the very uncertain science of _materia
medica_ fails."The true method of prayer was employed by the early Christians, until
the splendid vision of the Christ became obscured and finally lost to
the Church by its bargaining with Constantine for a mess of pottage,
namely, temporal power.Then began to rise that great worldly
institution, the so-called Holy Church.In the first half of the sixth
century Justinian closed the schools of philosophy at Athens.For a
while Judaizing Christianity continued its conflict with Gnosticism.And then both merged themselves into the Catholic form of faith, which
issued forth from Rome, with Christian tradition grafted upon
paganism.Theology and ritualism divided the gospel of healing the
sick and saving the sinner into two radically different systems,
neither of which is Christian, and neither of which can either heal or
save.Since then, lip-service and ceremonial have taken the place of
healing the sick and raising the dead.The world again slipped back
steadily from the spiritual to the material, and to-day ethics
constitutes our religion, and stupid drugs hold sway where once sat
enthroned the healing Christ-principle."Waite, that I have Catholic leanings myself,"
said Doctor Siler."I don't like to hear either my religion or my
profession abused.""My criticism, Doctor," replied Father Waite, "is but an exposure of
the entrenched beliefs and modes of the human mind.""But, sir, the Church is a great social force, and a present
necessity.""The worth of a belief as a social force, Doctor, must be ascertained
from its fruits.The Roman Church has been an age-long instigator of
wars, disorders, and atrocious persecutions throughout the world.Its
assumption that its creed is the only religious truth is an insult to
the world's expanding intelligence.Its arrogant claim to speak with
the authority of God is one of the anomalies of this century of
enlightenment.Its mesmeric influence upon the poor and ignorant is a
continuous tragedy."Are you unmindful of the Church's schools and
hospitals?"Nor am I ignorant of the fact that the success of
Christianity is _not_ measured by hospitals.Rather, their continuance
attests the lamentable failure of its orthodox misinterpretation.I do not want to see this splendid country
forced into the iron shackles of priestcraft."cried Haynerd, pounding the table with his
fist."The time has passed when a man can say, 'My church, be she
right or wrong, but my church!'and insist that it shall be forced
upon us, whether we like it or not!""Doctor," continued Father Waite, "the Romanist has always missed the
mark.He prayed to a God of love to give him power to exterminate
heretics--those who differed with him in belief.But he prayed with
iniquity, hatred, murder in his heart; and God, who is too pure to
know evil, heard him not.Prayer is the affirmation of omnipotent
_good_.Is it good to murder one's fellow-men?The Psalmist wrote: 'If
I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.'That is why
the Church's prayers and curses have failed, and why she herself is a
failing institution to-day.I say this in pity, not in malice.""I, sir, believe in a religion that can hate," returned the doctor."Christianity is as much a religion of hate as of love--hatred of all
that is evil and opposed to the revealed Word of God.""And thereby your religion will fail, and has failed, for God is love.You, by your hatred of what you consider evil, make evil real.Indeed,
the Church has always emphasized evil as a great and living reality.How could it ever hope to overcome it then?Your Church, Doctor, has
little of the meekness of the Christ, and so, little of his strength.Its numbers and great material
wealth do not constitute power.Its assumptions remind me of the
ancient Jews, who declared that God spent much of His time reading
their Talmud.You will have to lay aside, Doctor, all of it, and turn
to the simple, demonstrable teachings of Jesus.When you have learned
to do the works he did, then will you have justified yourself and your
faith."While Father Waite was speaking, Carmen had quietly risen and taken
her place at the piano.When he concluded, she began to play and sing
softly.As the sweet melody flowed out through the room the little
group became silent and thoughtful.Again it was that same weird
lament which the girl had sung long before in the Elwin school to
voice the emotions which surged up in her during her loneliness in the
great city.In it her auditors heard again that night the echoing
sighs of the passive Indians, enslaved by the Christian Spaniards.Hitt's head sank upon his breast as he listened.Haynerd tried to
speak, but choked.The Beaubien buried her face in her hands and wept
softly.The lines about Doctor Siler's mouth relaxed, and his lips
trembled.He rose quietly and went around to where Father Waite sat."My friend--" He bent and took Father Waite's hand.Father Waite sprang to his feet and threw an arm about the doctor."We
are more than that, Doctor," he whispered.And in
reality we are both, here and now, beloved children of God."Then he nodded to the others, and took his
departure.As he passed the piano Carmen rose and seized his hand."You know, Doctor, that we love you, don't you?""Your love," he murmured, as he bent over her hand, "is from the
Christ.Nay, it _is_ the Christ himself among us!"He would have said more, but his voice broke.When Hitt, Reverend Moore, and Doctor Morton had left, Haynerd, who
had remained for a moment to speak to Father Waite, turned to the
Beaubien."Madam," he said, "Mr.But--" He stopped and looked at Carmen."Well,
if I mistake not, his quietness this evening indicated his belief that
this might be our last meeting for some time."Then, abruptly:

"Telephone me, Carmen, if anything of interest comes up to-morrow in
Avon."The Beaubien turned quickly to the girl."You are going to Avon
to-morrow?There was a look of fear in her
eyes.Carmen drew the woman to her, then stooped and kissed her cheek."Mother dearest, I go to Avon with my God."CHAPTER 11


The town of Avon, two hours from New York, lay along Avon creek, from
which its first manufacturing industries derived their motive power.Years before, when it was little more than a barren stretch of sand,
some enterprising soul had built a cotton mill there, with only a few
primitive looms.As the years passed, and kindly Congresses reared
about the industry a high protective wall, the business prospered
marvelously.But shortly after the death of the senior Ames the
company became involved, through mismanagement, with the result that,
to protect itself, the house of Ames and Company, the largest
creditor, was obliged to take over its mills.At first, J. Wilton Ames was disposed to sell the assets of the
defunct company, despite the loss to his bank.But then, after a visit
of inspection, and hours of meditation on certain ideas which had
occurred to him, he decided to keep the property.The banging of the
looms, the whirr of the pickers, the sharp little shrieks of the
spinning machines, fascinated him, as he stood before them.They
seemed to typify the ceaseless throbbing of his own great brain.They
seemed, too, to afford another outlet for that mighty flood of
materialistic thought and energy which flowed incessantly through it.And so he set about reorganizing the business.He
familiarized himself with every detail of the cotton market.He was
already well versed in the intricacies of the tariff.And soon the
idle machinery was roaring again.Soon the capacity of the mills was
doubled.And soon, very soon, the great Ames mills at Avon had become
a corporate part of our stupendous mechanical development of the
century just closed.When Carmen stepped from the train that morning she stood for a moment
looking uncertainly about her.Everywhere on one side as far as she
could see were low, ramshackle frame houses; a few brick store
buildings stood far up the main street; and over at her right the
enormous brick mills loomed high above the frozen stream.The dull
roar of the machinery drifted through the cold air to her ears.Up the
track, along which she had just come, some ragged, illy clad children
were picking up bits of coal.She went directly to them, and asked their names."Anton Spivak," answered one of the children dully, when she laid a
hand on his shoulder."Over dere," pointing off to the jungle of decrepit sheds."Me an'
him, we worked in de mills; but dere ain't no work fer us now."Take me to your home," she said firmly."Dere ain't nobody to home," he
replied."De ol' man an' woman works in de mills daytimes.""Come-a home wi' me," spoke up the boy's companion, a bright-faced
little urchin of some ten years who had given his name as Tony Tolesi.Carmen looked at him for a moment.Up the main street of the town they went for a short distance, then
turned and wended their course, through narrow streets and byways,
down toward the mills.In a few minutes they were in the district
where stood the great frame structures built by the Ames company to
house its hands.Block after block of these they passed, massive,
horrible, decrepit things, and at last stopped at a grease-stained,
broken door, which the little fellow pushed open.Carmen followed shivering, close after the boy, while
he trotted along, proud of the responsibility of conducting a visitor
to his home.At the far end of the hall the lad plunged into a narrow
staircase, so narrow that a stout man could not have mounted it.Up
four of these broken flights Carmen toiled after him, and then down a
long, desolate corridor, which sent a chill into the very marrow of
her bones."Dis is where we lives, Missy," announced the little fellow."Miss-a
Marcus, she live in dere," pointing to the door directly opposite.He pushed open the door before which they had halted.A rush of foul
air and odors of cooking swept out.They enveloped the girl and seemed
to hurl her back.A black-haired woman, holding a crying baby in her
arms, rose hastily from an unmade bed at one side of the room.Two
little girls, six or eight years of age, and a boy still younger,
ranged about their mother and stared in wide-eyed wonder."Dis-a lady, she come to visit," announced Carmen's guide abruptly,
pointing a dirty finger at her.The woman's face darkened, and she spoke harshly in a foreign tongue
to the little fellow."She say," the boy interpreted, as a crestfallen look spread over his
face, "she say she don't spik _Inglese_.""But I speak your language," said the girl, going quickly to her and
extending a hand.Then, in that soft tongue which is music celestial
to these Neapolitan strangers upon our inhospitable shores, she added,
"I want to know you; I want to talk to you."A littered, greasy cook stove
stood in one corner.Close to it at either end were wooden couches,
upon which were strewn a few tattered spreads and blankets, stained
and grimy.A broken table, a decrepit chest of drawers, and a few
rickety chairs completed the complement of furniture.The walls were
unadorned, except for a stained chromo of the Virgin, and the plaster
had fallen away in many places.Several of its panes were broken and stuffed with rags and papers.At the sound of her own language the woman's expression changed.A
light came into her dull eyes, and she awkwardly took the proffered
hand.Then, sweeping
the girl's warm attire with a quick glance, "You are rich!I am rich, yes, but not in money."The woman turned to her children and sent the little brood scattering.At another sharp command little Tony set out a soiled, broken chair
for Carmen.But before the girl could take it the woman's voice again
rose sharply."You are--what do
you say?You come with your gay party to look us over and go
away laughing!But reaching out, she gently lifted the heavy
baby from the woman's arms and sat down with it.For a moment she
patted its cheeks and bent tenderly over it.Then she looked up at the
bewildered mother."I have come here," she said softly, "because I love you."She turned dully and sat down
on one of the begrimed beds.Her little ones gathered about her, their
soiled fingers in their mouths, or clutching their tattered gowns, as
they gazed at the beautiful creature who had suddenly come into their
midst."I am not from the mission," replied the girl gently."I have come to
talk, not of heaven, but of earth, and of you, and of Tony," smiling
down into the eager face of the little boy as he stood before her."You can't take
any of my children!The judge took Pietro Corrello's boy last
week--but you can't have mine!"I don't want your children," said Carmen, smiling up at the
frightened, suspicious mother.I want you to help me to
help all of these people here who need us.The mills are running only
half time, aren't they?But we,
you and I, are going to make things better for them, for everybody
here, aren't we?"But first," she went on hastily, to further allay the poor woman's
fears and to check additional protest, "suppose we plan our dinner.Let's see, Tony, what would you like?"He glanced
inquiringly at his mother; but no sign came from her.Then he could no
longer contain himself:

"Spaghetti!"Carmen drew out her purse and turned to the woman."While we are gone, Tony and the children will wash the dishes
and set the table.For a moment the woman looked uncomprehendingly at the girl, then at
her children, and then about the miserable room in which they were
huddled.Amazement and confusion sat upon her heavy features.Then
these gave way to another dark look of suspicion.She opened her
mouth--

But before she could voice her resentment, Carmen rose and threw an
arm about her.Then the girl quickly drew the startled woman to her
and kissed her on the cheek."Come," she whispered, "get your shawl.God's universal language is the language of love.All nations, all
tribes understand it.The flood-gates, long barred, swiftly opened,
and the tired, miserable woman sank sobbing upon the bed.She could
not comprehend what it was that had come so unannounced into her
dreary existence that cold winter morning.People were not wont to
treat her so.Her life had been an endless, meaningless struggle
against misery, want, grinding oppression.People did not put their
arms around her and kiss her thus.They scoffed at her, they abused
her, they fought with her!She hated them, and the world in which she
lived!"I know, I know," whispered Carmen, as she drew the sobbing woman's
head upon her shoulder.She drew back, and a frightened, superstitious look came into her
face."Yes," said Carmen softly, taking the cue, "I am an angel, right from
heaven.Now you are no longer afraid of me, are you?The woman rose mechanically and took up her thin shawl.Carmen gave a
few directions to the gaping children.And as she went out into the
bleak hall with the woman she heard one of them whisper in tones of
awe:

"Tony, she said she--she was--an angel!Get down on your knees
and cross yourself!"*       *       *       *       *

Upward to the blue vault of heaven, like the streaming mists that
rise through the tropic moonlight from the hot _llanos_, goes the
ceaseless cry of humanity.Oh, if the god of the preachers were real,
his heart must have long since broken!Upward it streams, this
soul-piercing cry; up from the sodden, dull-brained toiler at the
crashing loom; up from the wretched outcast woman, selling herself
to low passions to escape the slavery of human exploitation; up from
the muttering, ill-fed wreck, whose life has been cashed into
dividends, whose dry, worthless hulk now totters to the scrap heap;
up from the white-haired, flat-chested mother, whose stunted babes
lie under little mounds with rude, wooden crosses in the dreary
textile burial grounds; up from the weak, the wicked, the ignorant,
the hopeless martyrs of the satanic social system that makes
possible the activities of such human vultures as the colossus
whose great mills now hurled their defiant roar at this girl, this
girl whose life-motif was love.Close about her, at the wretched little table, sat the wondering group
of children, greedily gorging themselves on the only full meal that
they could remember.And with them sat the still bewildered mother,
straining her dark eyes at the girl, and striving to see in her a
human being, a woman like herself.At her right sat the widow Marcus,
who lived just across the hall.Her husband had been crushed to death
in one of the pickers two years before.The company had paid her a
hundred dollars, but had kept back five for alleged legal fees.She
herself had lost an arm in one of these same pickers, long ago,
because the great owner of the mills would not equip his plant with
safety devices.said the mother at length, as a sense of the reality of
life suddenly returned to her.Tony hurriedly swept the contents of his plate into his mouth, and
went for the battered dinner pail."My man goes to work at six-thirty in the morning," she explained to
Carmen, when the little fellow had started to the mills with the pail
unwontedly full."And he does not leave until five-thirty.He was a
weaver, and he earned sometimes ten dollars a week.And so he had to take a job as carder.He earns
about eight dollars a week now."But you can't live on that, with your children!""Yes, we could," replied the woman, "if the work was steady.You see, if I could work steady, and the children too, we could
live.And I am not nearly so worn out as he is.I
have several years left in me yet."The widow Marcus, who spoke the language from an association with
Italian immigrants since childhood, added her comments from time to
time.She was a gray-haired, kindly soul, bearing no enmity toward the
man to whom she had yielded her husband's life and her own."A man's no good in the mills after he's fifty," she said."You see,
Miss, it's all piece-work, and a man has to be most terribly spry and
active.The strain is something awful, day after day, in the noise and
bad air, and having to keep your eyes fixed on your work for ten hours
at a stretch; and he wears out fast.Then he has to take a job where
he can't make so much.And when he's about fifty he's no good for the
mills any more.""Well, if he hasn't any children, he goes to the poor-house.But, if
he has, then they take care of him.""Yes, they've got to, Miss.The little ones must work in the mills,
too.These mills here take them on when they are only twelve, or even
younger.Tony has worked there, and he is only ten.It's against the
law; but Mr.The company paid me some money two years ago, and I
haven't spent all of it yet.I'm pretty
spry with one arm.""But--you do not pay rent for your home?"Ames--the man whose machines killed your
husband and took off your arm--you still pay rent to him, for one
little room?"Why, his company gave me almost a
hundred dollars, you know!I was lucky, for when Lizzie Sidel's man
lost his hand in the cog wheels he went to law to sue the company, and
three years afterward the case was thrown out of court and he had to
pay the costs himself.But he was a picker-boss, and got nine dollars
a week."A little hand stole up along Carmen's arm.She looked down into the
wondering face of the child."I--I just wanted to see, _Signorina_, if
you were real.""I have been wondering that myself, dear," replied the girl, as her
thought dwelt upon what she had been hearing."I must go now, Miss," said the widow Marcus, rising."I promised to
drop in and look after Katie Hoolan's children this afternoon."Then I will go with you," Carmen announced."But I will come back
here," she added, as some little hands seized hers."If not to-day,
then soon--perhaps to-morrow."Marcus, and entered the doorway
which led to the little inner room where dwelt the widow.There were a
dozen such rooms in the building, the latter informed her.This one in
particular had been shunned for many years, for it had a bad
reputation as a breeder of tuberculosis.But the rent was low, and so
the widow had taken it after her man was killed.It contained a broken
stove, a dirty bed, and a couple of unsteady chairs.The walls were damp, and the paper which had once covered them
was molding and rotting off."It won't stay on," the widow explained, as she saw the girl looking
at it.The
creek overflows and runs into the basement.They call this the
'death-room.'"Carmen shuddered when she looked about this fearful human
habitation.Yet, "The only death to be feared," said Paracelsus, "is
unconsciousness of God."Was this impoverished woman, then, any less
truly alive than the rich owner of the mills which had robbed her of
the means of existence?And can a civilization be alive to the Christ
when it breeds these antipodal types?"Ames's
methods are the epitome of hell!But he is ours, and the worthy
offspring of our ghastly, inhuman social system.We alone are to
blame that he debauches courts, that he blinds executives, and that he
buys legislatures!We let him make the laws, and fatten upon the
prey he takes within their limits.Aye, he is the crafty, vicious,
gold-imbruted manifestation of a whole nation's greed!"Nay, more, he
is the externalization of a people's ignorance of God.Carmen's throat filled as she watched the old woman bustling about the
wretched room and making a feeble attempt at order."You see," the widow went on, happy in the possession of an auditor,
"there is no use making apologies for the looks of my room; I couldn't
make it look much better if I tried.We have
to get water from the hydrant down back of the house.It is pumped
there from the creek, and it's a long climb up these stairs when
you've got only one arm to hold the bucket.And I have to bring my
coal up, too.The coal dealer charges extra for bringing it up so
far."Carmen sat down on an empty box and watched her.The woman's lot
seemed to have touched the depths of human wretchedness, and yet there
burned within her soul a something that the oppression of human
avarice could not extinguish."It's the children, Miss, that I think about," she continued."It's
not so bad as when I was a little one and worked in the cloth mills in
England.I was only six when I went into the mills there.I worked
from seven in the morning until after six at night.And the air was so
bad and we got so tired that we children used to fall asleep, and the
boss used to carry a stick to whip us to keep us awake.My parents
died when I was only eight.They worked in the Hollow-ware works, and
died of lead poisoning.People only last four or five years at that
work.""How many children are employed in these mills here?""I want to see them," said the girl, and there was a hitch in her
voice as she spoke."You can go down and watch them come out about six this evening.But now I must hurry to look after the Hoolan
babes."When she again reached the street Carmen turned and looked up at the
hideous structure from which she had emerged; then she drew a long
breath.The foul air of the "death-room" seemed to fill her lungs as
with leaden weights.The dim light that lay over the wretched hovel
hung like a veil before her eyes."Katie lives a block down the street," said the widow, pointing in the
direction.These tenements don't have
fire-escapes, and the one she lived in burned to the ground in an
hour.She lived on the second floor, and got out.It seemed to Carmen as she listened to the woman that the carnal
mind's chamber of horrors was externalized there in the little town of
Avon, existing with the dull consent of a people too ignorant, too
imbruted, too mesmerized by the false values of life to rise and
destroy it.All that cold winter afternoon the girl went from door to door.There
was no thought of fear when she met dull welcomes, scowls, and
menacing glances.In humble homes and wretched hovels; to Magyar,
Pole, Italian alike; to French Canadian, Irish and Portuguese; and to
the angry, the defiant, the sodden, the crushed, she unfolded her
simple banner of love, the boundless love that discriminates not, the
love that sees not things, but the thoughts and intents of the heart
that lie behind them.And dark looks faded, and tears came; withered
hearts opened, and lifeless souls stirred anew.She knew their
languages; and that knowledge unlocked their mental portals to her.She knew their thoughts, and the blight under which they molded; and
that knowledge fell like the sun's bright rays upon them.She knew
God, their God and hers; and that knowledge began, even on that dull,
gray afternoon, to cut into the chains of human rapacity which
enslaved them.At six that evening she stood at the tall iron gate of the mill yard.Little Tony was at her side, clutching her hand.A single electric
lamp across the street threw a flickering, yellow light upon the snow.The great, roaring mills were ablaze with thousands of glittering
eyes.Suddenly their monster sirens shrieked, a blood-curdling yell.Then their huge mouths opened, and a human flood belched forth.They were not the image and likeness
of God, these creatures, despite the doctrinal platitudes of the
Reverend Darius Borwell and the placid Doctor Jurges.They were not
alive, these stooping, shuffling things, despite the fact that the
religiously contented Patterson Moore would argue that God had
breathed the spirit of life into the thing of dust which He created.And these children, drifting past in a great, surging throng!Fathers
and mothers of a generation to come!Carmen knew that many of them,
despite their worn looks, were scarcely more than ten years old.These
were the flesh and blood upon which Ames, the jungle-beast, waxed
gross!Upon their thin life-currents floated the magnificent
_Cossack_!Yes, she was right, evil can _not_ be
really known.There is no principle by which to explain the hideous
things of the human mind.And then she wondered what the Reverend
Darius Borwell did to earn that comfortable salary of ten thousand a
year in his rich New York church."It's quite a sight, ain't it, Miss?"He was a man of medium height,
young, and of Irish descent."It's a great sight," he continued, with a touch of brogue in his
tones.he cried, catching a passing workman's arm."He ain't worked to-day, Father," replied the man, stopping and
touching his cap.The young priest uttered an exclamation of displeasure.Then, as the
workman started away:

"You'll be at the Hall to-night, Fagin?The man addressed nodded and gave an affirmative grunt, then passed on
into the darkness."It's trying to reach a few of 'em I am," remarked the priest.When a man's stomach's empty he hasn't much respect
for morality.And I can't feed the lot of 'em!"Carmen gazed into the kindly blue eyes of the priest and wondered."No--but I am interested in my fellow-beings."I've some rooms, some on Main street,
which I call the Hall, and some down in the--well, the bad district,
which I call the Mission.They're reading rooms, places for men to meet,
and get acquainted, and rest, and talk.The Hall's for the fellows
who work, like this Fagin.The Mission's for the down-and-outs.""But--are your rooms only for--for men of your faith?""Race or
religion don't figure.It's to give help to every man that needs it.""And you are giving your life to help these people?""I want to see your Hall and Mission.Take me to them," she abruptly
demanded.He looked down at little Tony,
and then up at Carmen again."We will leave the boy at his door, and then go to
your Mission and Hall.Now tell me, you are a Roman Catholic priest?""Yes," he said mechanically, following her as she started away."How did you happen to get into this sort of work?""Oh, I've been at it these ten years!"he returned, now recovered from
his surprise, and pleased to talk about his work."I'd had some
experience in New York in the Bowery district.I came to the
conclusion that there were mighty few down-and-outs who couldn't be
set upon their pins again, given half a chance by any one sufficiently
interested.You see, Miss, I believe in my
fellow-men.Oh, it's only
temporary, I know.It ain't going to change the whole social system.But it helps a bit--and I like it."But," he continued more seriously, "there's going to be trouble here.And it's going to be a bad one."I've written him several times of late.But it's not
much I see he's doing, except to go on sucking the blood from these
poor devils down here!"They soon reached the tenement where Tony lived, and Carmen asked the
priest to go up with her."No," he said, "the good woman doesn't like priests.And my labors
don't reach the women anyway, except through the men.It was only by making many promises that Carmen could at last get away
from the little group on the fourth floor.But she slipped a bill into
Tony's hands as she went out, and then hurriedly crossed the hall and
opened the unlocked door of the widow Marcus's room.Carmen pinned a five-dollar bill upon the pillow and hastened
out."Now," said the priest, when the girl had joined him in the street
below, "it ain't right to take you to the Mission--"

"We'll go there first," the girl calmly announced.By the way, there's a telephone in your place?I want to call up
the health officer.I want to report the condition of these
tenements.""It won't do any good, Miss.I've camped on his
heels for months.If he
gets too troublesome to those higher up, why, he gets fired.He isn't here to report on conditions, but to
overlook 'em."You mean to say that nothing can be done in regard to those awful
buildings which Mr.Ames owns and rents to his mill hands?""It's criminal to let such buildings stand.Meanwhile, the priest was
studying his fair companion, and wondering who she might be.At length
he inquired if she had ever been in Avon before."Haven't seen Pillette's house then?He's resident manager of the Ames
mills.We can go a little out of our way and have a look at it."A few minutes later they stood at the iron gate of the manager's
residence, a massive, brown stone dwelling, set in among ancient trees
in an estate of several acres, and surrounded by shrubs and bushes."Does he know all about those tenements
down there?""Ah, that he does; and cares less.And he knows all about the terrible
hot air in his mills, and the flying lint that clogs the lungs of the
babies working there.He sees them leave the place, dripping with
perspiration, and go out into the zero temperature half naked.And
when they go off with pneumonia, well he knows why; and cares less.He
knows that the poor, tired workers in that great prison lose their
senses in the awful noise and roar, and sometimes get bewildered and
fall afoul of belts and cogs, and lose their limbs or lives.And he wouldn't put safety devices
over his machines, because he doesn't care.I've written to him a
dozen times about it.But--

"And then Pillette," he continued; "I've asked him to furnish his
hands with decent drinking water.They work ten and twelve hours in
that inferno, and when they want to drink, why, all they have is a
barrel of warm water, so covered with lint that it has to be pushed
aside in order to get at the water.Why, Pillette don't even give 'em
change rooms!He won't give 'em decent toilet rooms!Seems to me that when a man can give a ball and send
out invitations on cards of solid gold, he can afford to give a
thought to the thousands who have toiled and suffered in order to
enable him to give such a ball, don't you?"The memory came back now
in hot, searing thoughts."Oh, he catches 'em coming and going!""You see,
he manipulates Congress so that a high tariff law is passed,
protecting him from imported goods.Then he runs up the prices of his
output.That hits his mill hands, for they have to pay the higher
prices that the tariff causes.Oh, no, it doesn't result in increased
wages to them.He is
the only one who profits by high tariff on cotton goods.She might not know that Ames periodically appeared
before Congress and begged its protection--nay, threatened, and then
demanded.She might not know that Senator Gossitch ate meekly from the
great man's hand, and speciously represented to his dignified
colleagues that the benefits of high protective duties were for "the
people" of the United States.She might not know how Hood, employed to
evade the laws enacted to hedge and restrain his master, bribed and
bought, schemed and contrived, lobbied, traded, and manipulated, that
his owner might batten on his blood-stained profits, while he kept his
face turned away from the scenes of carnage, and his ears stopped
against the piteous cries of his driven slaves.But she did know how
needless it all was, and how easy, oh!how pitiably easy, it would be
to remedy every such condition, would the master but yield but a
modicum of his colossal, mesmeric selfishness.She did not know, she
could not, that the master, Ames, made a yearly profit from his mills
of more than two hundred per cent.But she did know that, were he less
stupidly greedy, even to the extent of taking but a hundred per cent
profit, he would turn a flood of sunshine into hundreds of sick,
despairing, dying souls."This is the place," she heard the priest say, his voice seeming to
come from a long distance.They were in front of an old,
two-story building, decrepit and forbidding, but well lighted.While
she gazed, the priest opened the door and bade her enter."This down here is the reading room," he explained.Upstairs is my office, and sleeping rooms for men.Also a
stock of old clothes I keep on hand for 'em when I send 'em out to
look for work.I've clothed an average of four men a day during the
past year, and sent 'em out to look for jobs.I board 'em, and keep
'em going until they land something.Sometimes I have to lend 'em
money.No, I never bother about a
man's religion.Carmen climbed the rough steps to the floor above and entered the
small but well-kept office of the priest."Now here," he said, with a touch of pride, "is my card-index.I keep
tab on all who come here.When they get straightened up and go out to
hunt work, I give 'em identification cards.Just as soon as I can get
funds I'm going to put a billiard table back there and fit up a little
chapel, so's the Catholic men who drift in here can attend service.You know, a lot of 'em don't have the nerve to go to a church.Carmen looked at the man in admiration."We haven't either of us asked the other's name," she said."I've been dying to know yours," he
replied."I'm Father Magee, Daniel Magee.Oh, give any name; it doesn't matter,
just so's I'll know how to address you."And I am from South America," said the girl
simply.*       *       *       *       *

An hour later the girl rose from her chair."I shall have to wait and
visit the Hall another time," she said."I must catch the eight-thirty
back to the city.But--"

"I'll never see you go down this tough street to the depot alone!"averred the priest, reaching for his hat.But she gratefully accepted the proffered escort.Two
of Father Magee's assistants had come in meanwhile, and were caring
for the few applicants below."You're right, Miss Carmen," the priest said, as they started for the
train.It eats my heart out to
see the suffering of these poor people!"At eleven o'clock that night Carmen entered the office of the city
editor of the Express."Ned," she said, "I've been with Dante--no,
Danny--in Inferno.I want expense
money--a good lot--so that I can leave to-morrow night."Haynerd's eyes dilated as he stared at the girl.But what did you find down in Avon?""I'll write you a detailed report of my trip to-morrow.I'm going home
now," she replied.CHAPTER 12


It is sometimes said of the man who toils at forge or loom in this
great commonwealth that he is fast forgetting that Washington is
something more significant to him than what is embraced in the
definition of the gazetteers.Not so, however, of that class of the
genus _homo_ individualized in J. Wilton Ames.He leaned not upon such
frail dependence as the _Congressional Record_ for tempered reports of
what goes on behind closed legislative doors; he went behind those
doors himself.He needed not to yield his meekly couched desires to
the law-builders whom his ballot helped select; he himself launched
those legislators, and gave them their steering charts.But, since the
interpretation of laws was to him vastly more important than their
framing, he first applied himself to the selection of judges, and
especially those of the federal courts.With these safely seated and
instructed at home, he gave himself comfortably to the task of holding
his legislators in Washington to the course he chose.Carmen had not spent a day at the Capital before the significance of
this fact to the common citizen swept over her like a tidal wave.If
the people, those upon whom the stability of the nation rests, looked
as carefully after appointments and elections as did Ames, would their
present wrongs continue long to endure?And after she
had spent the day with the Washington correspondent of the Express, a
Mr.Sands, who, with his young wife, had just removed to the Capital,
she knew more with respect to the mesmerism of human inertia and its
baneful effects upon mankind than she had known before.And yet, after that first day of wandering through the hallowed
precincts of a nation's legislative halls, she sat down upon a bench
in the shadow of the Capitol's great dome and asked herself the
questions: "What am I here for, anyway?And
instinct with her, as we have said, was unrestrained dependence upon
her own thought, the thought which entered her mentality only after
she had first prepared the way by the removal of every obstruction,
including self.At the breakfast table the second morning after her arrival in the
city, Mr.Sands handed her a copy of the Express.Among the editorials
was her full report upon conditions as she had found them in Avon,
published without her signature.Following it was the editor's
comment, merciless in its exposition of fact, and ruthless in its
exposure of the cruel greed externalized in the great cotton industry
in that little town.Carmen rose from the table indignant and protesting.Hitt had said he
would be wise in whatever use he made of her findings.But, though
quite devoid of malignity, this account and its added comment were
nothing less than a personal attack upon the master spinner, Ames.And
she had sent another report from Washington last night, one comprising
all she had learned from Mr.She
must get in touch with him at once.So she set out to find a telegraph
office, that she might check the impulsive publisher who was openly
hurling his challenge at the giant Philistine.When the message had gone, the girl dismissed the subject from her
thought, and gave herself up completely to the charm of the glorious
morning and her beautiful environment.For some time she wandered
aimlessly about the city; then bent her steps again toward the
Capitol.At the window of a florist she stopped and looked long and lovingly at
the gorgeous display within.In the midst of the beautiful profusion a
single flower held her attention.It was a great, brilliant red rose,
a kind that she had never seen before."We call it the 'President' rose, Miss," said the salesman in response
to her query.And when she went out with the splendid flower burning on her bosom
like living fire, she was glad that Hitt had not been there to see her
pay two dollars for it.The great Capitol seemed to fascinate her, as she stood before it a
few moments later.The mighty
sentiments and motives which had actuated the framers of the
Constitution seemed to loom before her like monuments of eternal
stone.Had statesmanship degenerated from that day of pure patriotism
into mere corruption?"Why, my dear girl,
the people of your great State are represented in the national Senate
by--whom?By the flies on the panes; by the mice in
the corners; by the god, perhaps, to whom the chaplain offers his
ineffectual prayers; but not by men.No; one of your Senators
represents a great railroad; the other an express company!Those Senators know no such ridiculous creature as 'the people'!"She turned from the Capitol, and for an hour or more strolled in the
brilliant sunlight."An economic disease," she murmured at length.And, like all disease, it is mental.It is a
disease of the human conscience.It comes from the fear of separation
from good.It all reduces to the belief of separation from God--the
belief that upon men's own human efforts depend all the happiness and
satisfaction they can have.Why, I have never known anything but
happiness and abundance!And yet, _I have never made a single effort
to acquire them_!"For the girl saw not the past vicissitudes of her
life except as shadowy mists, which dimmed not the sun of her joy.There was a tramping of horses' feet.It struck her, and brushed her to one side.She strove to hold
herself, but fell.The man and his companion were off their horses instantly, and
assisted the girl to her feet.asked the one who had been riding ahead."I called to
you, but you didn't seem to hear."laughed the girl, recovering her breath, and stooping to
brush the dust from her dress."Well, I'm glad to hear that!Perhaps you had better come in with
us."The girl raised her head and looked into his face with a bright smile.The man's anxious expression slowly changed into one of wonder, and
then of something quite different.The girl's long, thick hair had
been loosened by the fall, and was hanging about her shoulders.Framed
in the deep brown profusion was the fairest face he had ever looked
upon; the most winning smile; the most loving, compassionate glance."You'll have to come in now, and let the maid help you," he said
firmly."And I'll send you home in an auto."New York," replied Carmen, a little confused as she struggled vainly
with her hair."Oh, I'm not going to fuss with it any more!""Yes, I'll go with you, and let the maid do it up.She glanced about her, and then up the avenue toward which the men had
been riding.A flush suddenly spread over her face, and she turned and
looked searchingly at the man."You--you--live--in--there?"she stammered, pointing toward the
distant house."And you are--"

"Yes," he replied, coming to her assistance, but evidently greatly
enjoying her embarrassment, "I am the President."Then her hand stole mechanically to the rose flaming upon her bosom."I--I guess I know why I bought this now," she said softly.Quickly
unpinning it, she extended it to the man."I was bringing it to you,
wasn't I?"The picture was one that would have rejoiced an artist: the simple
girl, with her tumbled hair and wonderful face, standing there in the
glorious sunlight, holding out a single rose to the chief executive of
a great nation.The President bowed low and took the proffered flower.But the one who gives it is far more so."Then he bade his companion take the two horses to the stable, and
motioned to Carmen to accompany him."I was just returning from my morning ride," he began again, "when you
happened--"

"Things _never_ happen," interrupted the girl gently.He looked at her with a little quizzical side glance."Then you didn't
happen to be in the way?""I was obeying the law of cause and
effect.""A desire to see you, I guess.Or, perhaps, the _necessity_ of seeing
you.And because I wanted to see you in the interests of good, why,
evil seemed to try to run over me.""But why should you wish to see me?""Because you are the head of a wonderful nation.Then:

"You came down from New York to talk with me?""I think I came all the way from South America to see you," she said.There is a revolution in progress down there now.Did you
come to see me about that?I can do nothing--"

The girl shook her head."No," she said, "it's to prevent a revolution
here in your own country that I think I have come to see you."They had by now reached the door of the Executive Mansion.Entering,
the President summoned a maid, and turned the big-eyed girl over to
her."Bring her to my office," he directed, "when she is ready."A little later the nameless girl from Simiti again stood before the
President of the United States."I have an important conference at ten," he said, glancing at a clock."But we have a few minutes before that time.Will you--may I ask you
to tell me something about yourself?"he added, looking
apprehensively at her while he set out a chair.The girl drew the chair close to his desk and sat down."I know
nothing about accidents," she said quietly.Then, turning quite from
that topic, she drew the President quickly into her thought and
carried him off with her as on a magic carpet.From time to time he turned and
stared at his strange visitor.At other times he made notes of points
which impressed him.Once he interrupted, when she made reference to
her past life."This priest, Jose de Rincon, might he not have been
imprisoned as a political offender?""I do not know," the girl replied tenderly."My foster-father,
Rosendo, did not mention him in the two letters which I have
received."The President nodded; and the girl went rapidly on.Soon she was deep
in the problem presented by Avon.But at the mention of that town, and of its dominating genius, the
President seemed to become nervous.At length he raised a hand, as if
to end the interview."I fear I can do nothing at present," he said with an air of
helplessness."But," she protested, "you have the public welfare at heart.And can
you not see that public welfare is the welfare of each individual?"Ames well," the President replied, somewhat irrelevantly."He, like all men of great wealth, presents a serious problem,
doubtless.But he himself, likewise, is confronted by problems of very
trying natures.We must give him time to work them out.""It's like getting at the essence of Christianity,"
she said."The world has had nearly two thousand years in which to do
that, but it hasn't made much of a start as yet."But," the President resumed reflectively, "after all, it is the
people who are wholly responsible for the conditions which exist among
them.They have the means of remedying every economic situation, the
ballot.It is really all in their hands, is it not?They elect their
public officers, their judges, and their lawmakers.""You too," she said, "take refuge in the cant
of the age.Yes, the people do try to elect public servants; but by
some strange anomaly the servant becomes master the moment he enters
the door of office.And then
they, and you, sit helplessly back and cry, No use!And if the people
rise, their servants meet them with a hail of lead.It's really
childishly ridiculous, isn't it?when you stop to consider it
seriously."She leaned her elbows upon the desk, and sat with chin in her hands,
looking squarely into the eyes of the President."So you, the head of this great nation, confess to utter helplessness,"
she slowly said.A servant entered at that moment with a card.The President glanced at
it, and bade him request the caller to wait a few moments.Then, after
some reflection:

"The people will always--"

The door through which the servant had passed was abruptly thrown
open, and a harsh voice preceded the entrance of a huge bulk."I am not accustomed to being told to wait, Mr.President," said the
ungracious voice."My appointment was for ten o'clock, and I am here
to keep it."Then the newcomer stopped abruptly, and stared in amazement at the
young girl, sitting with her elbows propped upon the desk, and her
face close to that of the President.His
attention was centered upon the girl who sat looking calmly up at him.A dark, menacing scowl drew his bushy eyebrows together, and made the
sinister look which mantled his face one of ominous import to the
person upon whom it fell.Carmen was the first to break the tense silence.With a bright smile
illuming her face she rose and held out a hand to the giant before
her."We meet pretty often, don't
we?"Ames ignored both the greeting and the extended hand.Turning upon the
President, he said sharply: "So, the Express seeks aid in the White
House, eh?"Ames," said Carmen quickly, answering for the President."It
seeks to aid the White House.""Might I ask," he said in a tone of mordant
sarcasm, "how you learned that I was to be here this morning?I would
like to employ your methods of espionage in my own business.""I would give anything if you _would_ employ my methods in your
business," returned the girl gently.The President looked in embarrassment from one to the other."I think,
Miss Carmen," he said, "that we must consider our interview ended.A peculiar expression had come into Ames's features.President," he said in a tone pregnant with
meaning."I am glad to have a representative of the New York press
with us to hear you express your attitude toward the cotton
schedule."His
indignation mounted, but he checked it."The schedule has been reported out of committee," he replied briefly."I am aware of that," said Ames."And your influence with Congress in
regard to it?""Shall the Avon mills be closed pending a decision?Or, on the
assumption that Congress will uphold the altered schedule, must the
Spinners' Association begin immediate retrenchment?As president of
that Association, I ask for instructions.""My influence with Congress, as you well know, Mr.Ames, is quite
limited," replied the hectored executive."It is not a question of the _amount_ of your influence with that
body, Mr.President," returned Ames coldly, "but of how you will
employ that which you have."Silence lay upon them all for some moments.Then Ames resumed:

"I would remind you," he remarked with cruel insinuation, "that--or,"
glancing at the girl, "perhaps I should not make this public."He
paused and awaited the effect of his significant words upon the
President.Then, as the latter remained silent, he went on evenly:

"Second-term prospects, you are aware, are often very greatly
influenced by public facts regarding the first election.Of course we
are saying nothing that the press might use, but--well, you must
realize that there is some suspicion current as to the exact manner in
which your election was--"

"I think you wish to insinuate that my election was due to the
Catholic vote, which you controlled in New York, and to your very
generous campaign contributions, do you not?I see no reason for
withholding from the press your views on the subject.""But, my friend, this is an age of investigation, and of suspicion
toward all public officials.And such rumors wouldn't look well on the
front pages of the press throughout the country.Of course, our young
friend here isn't going to mention them to her superiors; but,
nevertheless, they ought to be suppressed at once.Their effect upon
your second-term prospects would be simply annihilating.Now I am in a
position to greatly assist in the matter of--well, in fact, I have
already once offered my aid to the Express.And I stand ready now to
join with it in giving the lie to those who are seeking to embarrass
the present administration.Miss Carmen is with us--"

"Mr.Ames," the girl quietly interrupted, "I wish _you_ were with
_us_.""But, my dear girl, have I--"

"For then there would be no more suffering in Avon," she added.Then it was you who wrote that misleading stuff in the Express,
eh?May I ask," he added with a contemptuous
sneer, "by whose authority you have visited the houses occupied by my
tenants, without my permission or knowledge?I take it you were down
there, although the cloudy weather must have quite dimmed your
perception.""Yes," she answered in a low voice, "I have been there.Yes, I visited your charnel houses and your cemeteries.I held their trembling hands, and stroked their
hot brows.I fed them, and gave them the promise that I would plead
their cause with you."But you first come here to--"

"It was with no thought of seeing you that I came to Washington, Mr.If I cross your path often, it must be for a purpose not yet
revealed to either of us.Perhaps it is to warn you, to awaken you, if
not too late, to a sense of your desperate state."You are drunk, you know, drunk with greed.And such continuous
drunkenness has made you sick unto death.It is the same dread disease
of the soul that the wicked Cortez told the bewildered Mexicans he
had, and that could be cured only with gold.Ames, that you are mesmerized by the evil which is always using you."She stood close to the huge man, and looked straight up into his face.He remained for a moment motionless, yielding again to that
fascination which always held him when in her presence, and of which
he could give no account to himself.That slight, girlish figure--how
easily he could crush her!"But you couldn't, you know," she said cryptically, as she shook her
head.He recoiled a step, struck by the sudden revelation that the girl had
read his thought.Ames," she continued, "what a craven error is before
truth.It makes a coward of you, doesn't it?Your boasted power is
only a mesmerism, which you throw like a huge net over your victims.You and they can break it, if you will.""We really must consider our
interview ended."I guess the appointment was made for to-day," the girl said softly."And by a higher power than any of us.Ames is the type of man who
is slowly turning our Republican form of government into a despotism
of wealth.He boasts that his power is already greater than a czar's.You bow before it; and so the awful monster of privilege goes on
unhampered, coiling its slimy tentacles about our national resources,
our public utilities, and natural wealth.I--I can't see how you, the
head of this great nation, can stand trembling by and see him do it.He made as if to reply, but restrained himself.A stern look then came into the
President's face.Then he
turned again to his desk and sat down."Please be seated," he said, "both of you.I don't know what quarrel
there is between you two, and I am not interested in it.But you, Miss
Carmen, represent the press; Mr.The things which have
been voiced here this morning must remain with us alone.Now let us
see if we can not meet on common ground.Is the attitude of your
newspaper, Miss Carmen, one of hostility toward great wealth?""The Express raises its voice only against the folly and wickedness of
the human mind, not against personality," replied the girl.We attack only the human thought which manifests in him.We
oppose the carnal thought which expresses itself in the folly, the
madness of strife for excessive wealth.It is that strife that makes
our hospitals and asylums a disgraceful necessity.It makes the
immigrant hordes of Europe flock here because they are attracted by
the horrible social system which fosters the growth of great fortunes
and makes their acquisition possible.Our alms-houses and prisons
increase in number every year.It is because rich men misuse their
wealth, trample justice under foot, and prostitute a whole nation's
conscience."They do not all--"

"It is a law of human thought," said Carmen in reply, "that mankind in
time become like that which has absorbed their attention.Rich men
obey this law with utmost precision.They acquire the nature and
character of their god, gold.They rapidly grow to be like that which
they blindly worship.They grow
metallic, yellow, calloused, unchanging, and soulless, like the coins
they heap up.There is the great danger to our country, Mr.And it is against the human thought that produces such beings--thought
stamped with the dollar mark--that the Express opposes itself."She hesitated, and looked in the direction of Ames.Then she added:

"Their features in time reveal to the world their metallic thought.Their veins shrivel with the fiery lust of gold.And then, at last, they crumble and sink into the dust of
which their god is made.And still their memories continue to poison
the very sources of our national existence.You see," she concluded,
"there is no fool so mired in his folly as the man who gives his soul
for great wealth.""A very enjoyable little sermon, preached for my benefit, Miss
Carmen," interposed Ames, bowing to her."And now if you have finished
excoriating my poor character," he continued dryly, "will you kindly
state by whose authority you publish to the world my affairs?"The maudlin sentimentalism of such as you make us all suffer!""Hadn't we better sing a hymn
now?You'll be wiser in a few years, I hope."Ames, by what right you own
mines, and forests, and lands?"By the divine right of law, most assuredly," he retorted.I have learned," she
continued, turning to the President, "that a bare handful of men own
or control all the public utilities of this great country.But," abruptly, "you believe in God, don't you?"He nodded his head, although with some embarrassment.His religion
labored heavily under political bias.She looked down at the floor, and sat silent for a while."Divine
right," she began to murmur, "the fetish of the creatures made rich by
our man-made social system!'The heavens are thine, the earth also is
thine: as for the world and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded
them.'But, oh, what must be the concept of God held by the rich, a
God who bestows these gifts upon a few, and with them the privilege
and divine consent to oppress and crush their fellow-men!What a low
order of intelligence the rich possess!An intelligence wherein the
sentiments of love and justice have melted into money!"President," put in Ames at this juncture, "I think we have spent
quite enough time moralizing.Suppose you now indicate your attitude
on the cotton tariff.Her sparkling eyes looked right into the
President's."I admire the man," she said,
"who dares to stand for the right in the face of the great taboo!There are few men nowadays who stand for anything in particular."exclaimed Ames, aware now that he had made a mistake in
permitting the girl to remain, "I wish my interview to be with you
alone, Mr."I have embarrassed you both, haven't I?"But first--"

She went to Ames and laid a hand on his arm."I wish--I wish I might
awaken you," she said gently."There is no victim at Avon in so
desperate a state as you.More gold will not cure you, any more than
more liquor can cure a slave to strong drink.You do not know that you
are hourly practicing the most despicable form of robbery, the
wringing of profits which you do not need out of the dire necessities
of your fellow-beings."She stopped and smiled down into the face of the man.This girl always dissected his soul with a smile on
her face."I wish I might awaken you and your poor victims by showing you and
them that righteousness makes not for a home in the skies, but for
greater happiness and prosperity for everybody right here in this
world.Don't you really want the little babies to have enough to eat
down there at Avon?Do you really want the President to support you in
the matter of the cotton schedule, and so increase the misery and
sorrow at your mills?that one's greatest
happiness is found only in that of others."She stood looking at him
for a few moments, then turned away.The President rose and held out his hand to her.She almost laughed as
she took it, and her eyes shone with the light of her eager, unselfish
desire."I--I guess I'm like Paul," she said, "consumed with zeal.Anyway,
you'll wear my rose, won't you?""And--you are not a bit afraid about a second term, are you?As for
party principle, why, you know, there is only _one_ principle, God.He
is the Christ-principle, you know, and that is way above party
principle."Under the spell of the girl's strange words every emotion fled from
the men but that of amazement."Righteousness, you know, is right-thinking.And that touches just
that about which men are most chary, their pocketbooks."Then she arched her brows and said naively:
"You will find in yesterday's Express something about Avon.You will
not use your influence with Congress until you have read it, will
you?"A deep quiet fell upon the men, upon the great executive and the great
apostle of privilege.It seemed to the one that as the door closed
against that bright presence the spirit of night descended; the other
sat wrapped in the chaos of conflicting emotions in which she always
left him."She's the bastard daughter of a <DW64> priest," replied Ames in an
ugly tone.cried the thoroughly angered Ames, bringing a huge
fist down hard upon the desk.And, what's
more, she's head over heels in love with another renegade priest!"But that's neither here nor there," he continued savagely."I want to
know what you are going to do for us?""I--I do not see, Mr.Ames, that I can do anything," replied the
President meditatively."Well--will you leave the details to us, and do as we tell you then?"the financier pursued, taking another tack."Yes--about the girl, you--"

"Damn the girl!""I've got proofs that will ruin
her, and you too--and, by God, I'll use 'em, if you drive me to it!You seem to forget that you were elected to do our bidding, my
friend!"For a long time he sat
staring at the floor."It was wonderful," he said,
"wonderful the way she faced you, like David before Goliath!There
isn't a vestige of fear in her make-up.I--we'll talk this matter over
some other time, Mr.roared Ames, his self-control flying to the
winds."I can ruin you--make your administration a laughing-stock--and
plunge this country into financial panic!Do you do as I say, or
not?"The President looked the angry man squarely in the eyes."I do not,"
he answered quietly.CHAPTER 13


"It's corking!cried Haynerd, when he and Hitt had
finished reading Carmen's report on her first few days in Washington."Makes a fellow feel as if the best thing Congress could do would be
to adjourn for about fifty years, eh?But
she's a wonder, Hitt!And she's booming the Express to the skies!That's why she is so--as the
Mexicans say--_simpatico_.""Well, not with you, I hope!""No, unfortunately," replied Haynerd, assuming a dejected mien, "but
with that Rincon fellow--and he a priest!He's got a son down in
Cartagena somewhere, and he doesn't write to her either.She's told
Sid the whole story, and he's working it up into a book during his odd
moments.But, say," turning the conversation again into its original
channel, "how much of her report are we going to run?You know, she
tried to head us off.As if she
hadn't already attacked him and strewn him all over the field!""We'll have to be careful in our allusions to the President," replied
Hitt."I'll rewrite it myself, so as not to offend her or him.her reports are the truth, and they rightfully
belong to the people!The Express is the avowed servant of the
public!I see no reason for
concealing a thing.Did I tell you that I had two inquiries from
Italian and German papers, asking permission to translate her reports
into their own columns?"Did you wire her to see
Gossitch and Mall?""Yes, and Logue, as well as others.And I've put dozens of senators
and congressmen on our mailing list, including the President himself.I've prepared letters for each one of them, calling attention to the
girl and her unique reports.She certainly writes in a fascinating
vein, doesn't she?Meanwhile, she's circulating around down there and
advertising us in the best possible manner.he finished, slapping the city editor roundly upon the back."Confine your enthusiasm to words, my
friend.Say, what did you do about that liquid food advertisement?""Discovered that it was beer," replied Hitt, "and turned it firmly
down."Not that we care to advertise it, but--"

Hitt laughed."When that fellow Claus smoothly tried to convince me
that beer was a food, I sent a sample of his stuff to the Iles
chemical laboratory for analysis.They reported ninety-four per cent
water, four per cent alcohol--defined now as a poisonous drug--and
about two per cent of possible food substance.If the beer had been of
the first grade there wouldn't have been even the two per cent of
solids.You know, I couldn't help thinking of what Carmen said about
the beer that is advertised in brown bottles to preserve it from the
deleterious effects of light.Light, you know, starts decay in beer.Well, light, according to Fuller, is 'God's eldest daughter.'Emerson
says it is the first of painters, and that there is nothing so foul
that intense light will not make it beautiful.Thus the light of truth destroys the fermentation which
is supposed to constitute the human mind and body.So light tries to
purify beer by breaking it up.The brewers have to put it into brown
bottles to preserve its poisonous qualities.As Carmen says, beer
simply can't stand the light.It's astonishing that so many so-called reputable papers will
take their advertising stuff.It's just as bad as patent medicine
ads."And I note that the American public still spend their annual
hundred million dollars for patent medicine dope.Most of this is
spent by women, who are largely caught by the mail-order trade.I
learned of one exposure recently made where it was found that a widely
advertised eye wash was composed of borax and water.The cost was
somewhere about five cents a gallon, and it sold for a dollar an
ounce.Nice little profit of some two hundred and fifty thousand per
cent, and all done by the mesmerism of suggestive advertising.Speaking of parasites on
society, Ames is not the only one!""And yet those fellows howl and threaten us with the boycott because
we won't advertise their lies and delusions.It's as bad as
ecclesiastical intolerance!"Then she returned to New York and
went directly to Avon.What she did there can only be surmised by a
study of her reports to Hitt, who carefully edited them and ran them
in the Express.Again, after several days, she journeyed back to
Washington.Her enthusiasm was boundless; her energy exhaustless; her
industry ceaseless; and her persistency doggedly unshakable.In
Washington she made her way unhindered among those whom she deemed
essential to the work which she was doing.Doubtless her ability to do
this and to gain an audience with whomsoever she might choose was in
great part due to her beauty and charming simplicity, her grace of
manner, and her wonderful and fearless innocence, combined with a
mentality remarkable for its matured powers.Hitt and Haynerd groaned
over her expenses, but promptly met them."She's worth it," growled the latter one day."She's had four
different talks with the President!How on earth do you suppose she
does it?And how did she get Mall and Logue to take her to dinner and
to the theater again and again?And what did she do to induce that
doddering old blunderbuss, Gossitch, to tell her what Ames was up to?How do you suppose she found out that
Ames was hand in glove with the medical profession, and working tooth
and nail to help them secure a National Bureau of Health?Say, do you
know what that would do?It would foist allopathy upon every chick and
child of us!Have
we come to that in this supposedly free country?By the way, Hitt,
Doctor Morton has been let out of the University.He says Ames
did it because of his association with us."I think, my friend," replied Hitt, "that it is a very serious matter,
and one that impinges heavily upon the rights of every one of us, when
a roaring lion like Ames is permitted to run loose through our
streets."I've centered my hopes in Carmen," sighed Haynerd.If she can't stop him, then God himself can't!"A few moments later he came out
again and handed an opened letter to Haynerd."Some notes she's sent
from Washington.Mentions the National Bureau of Health project.It
hasn't escaped her, you see.Say, will you tell me where she picks up
her information?""The Lord gives it to her, I guess," said Haynerd, glancing over the
letter."'Reverend Borwell and Doctor Siler are down here lobbying for the
  National Bureau of Health bill.Also, Senator Gossitch dropped a
  remark to me yesterday which makes me believe that he and other
  Senators have been approached by Tetham with reference to sending
  an American ambassador to the Vatican.Haynerd handed the letter back to Hitt and plunged into the papers on
his desk."This
country's going stark, staring mad!We're crazy, every mother's son of
us!""It's the human mind that is crazy, Ned, because it is wholly without
any basis of principle," returned Hitt with a sigh.*       *       *       *       *

"Doctor Siler!exclaimed that worthy person, looking up from
the gutter, whither he had hastened after his silk hat which had been
knocked off by the encounter with the young girl who had rounded the
corner of Ninth street into Pennsylvania avenue and plunged full into
him."Oh, I'm so sorry, Doctor!I was coming from the Smithsonian
Institution, and I guess--"

"Don't mention it, Miss Carmen.It's a privilege to have my hat
knocked off by such a radiant creature as you."And I want to offer
my--"

"Look here, Miss Carmen, just offer yourself as my guest at luncheon,
will you?That will not only make amends, but place me hopelessly in
your debt.""I was on my way to a
restaurant."I've got a little place around the corner here
that would have made Epicurus sit up nights inditing odes to it."The girl laughed merrily, and slipped her arm through his.A few
minutes later they were seated at a little table in a secluded corner
of the doctor's favorite chophouse."By the way, I met a friend of yours a few minutes ago," announced the
doctor, after they had given their orders."He was coming out of the
White House, and--were you ever in a miniature cyclone?That's twice to-day I've been sent to the gutter!"He laughed heartily
over his experiences, then added significantly: "You and he are both
mental cyclones, but producing diametrically opposite effects."The doctor went on chatting
volubly."Ames and the President don't seem to be pulling together
as well as usual.The President has come out squarely against him
now in the matter of the cotton schedule.Ames declares that the
result will be a general financial panic this fall.Sands, the Express correspondent, seems to be getting mighty close
to administration affairs these days.Where did he get that data
regarding a prospective National Bureau of Health, do you suppose?""I gave it to him," was the simple reply.The doctor dropped his fork, and stared at the girl."Well--of course you naturally would be opposed to it.But--"

"Tell me," she interrupted, "tell me candidly just what you doctors
are striving for, anyway.Are your activities
all quite utilitarian, or--is it money and monopoly that you are
after?It makes a lot of difference, you know, in one's attitude
toward you.If you really seek the betterment of health, then you are
only honestly mistaken in your zeal.But if you are doing this to make
money--and I think you are--then you are a lot of rascals, deserving
defeat.""Miss Carmen, do you impugn my motives?"He began to color slightly under her keen
scrutiny."Well," she finally continued, "let's see.If you doctors
have made the curative arts effective, and if you really do heal
disease, then I must support you, of course.But, while there is
nothing quite so important to the average mortal as his health, yet I
know that there is hardly anything that has been dealt with in such a
bungling way.The art of healing as employed by our various schools of
medicine to-day is the result of ages and ages of experimentation and
bitter experience, isn't it?And its cost in human lives is simply
incalculable.No science is so speculative, none so hypothetical, as
the so-called science of medicine.""But we have had to learn," protested the doctor."Do you realize, Doctor," she resumed, "that the teaching and
preaching of disease for money is one of the greatest curses resting
upon the world to-day?I never saw a doctor until I was on the boat
coming to New York.And then I thought he was one of the greatest
curiosities I had ever seen.I followed him about and listened to him
talk to the passengers.And I learned that, like most of our young
men, he had entered the practice of medicine under the pressure of
dollars rather than altruism.Money is still the determining factor in
the choice of a profession by our young men.And success and fortune
in the medical profession, more than in any other, depend upon the
credulity of the ignorant and helpless human mind.""Do you deny that great progress has been made in the curative arts?""See what we have done with diphtheria, with typhoid,
with smallpox, and malaria!""Surely, Doctor, you can not believe that the mere temporary removing
of a disease is _real_ healing!You render one lot of microbes
innocuous, after thousands of years of experimentation, and leave
mankind subject to the rest.Do
you expect to go on that way, making set after set of microbes
harmless to the human body, and thus in time, after millions of years,
eradicate disease entirely?Do you think that people will then cease
to die?All the time you are working only in matter and through
material modes.Do you expect thereby to render the human sense of
life immortal?Your patients
get well, only to fall sick again.And death to you is still as
inevitable as ever, despite your boasted successes, is it not so?"He broke into a bantering laugh, but did not reply."Doctor, the human mind is self-inoculated.It will keep on
making them, until it is educated out of itself, and taught to do
better.Then it will give place to the real reflection of divine mind;
and human beings will be no more.Why don't you realize this, you
doctors, and get started on the right track?Your real work is in the
_mental_ realm."Well, I for one have little respect for faith cure--"

"Nor I," she interposed."Dependence upon material drugs, Doctor, is
reliance upon the _phenomena_ of the human mind.Faith cure is
dependence upon the human mind itself, upon the _noumenon_, instead of
the _phenomenon_.Hypnotism is mental
suggestion, the suggestions being human and material, not divine
truth.The drugging system is an outgrowth of the belief of life in
matter.Faith cure is the belief of life and power inherent in the
human mind.The origin of healing is
shrouded in mythology, and every step of its so-called progress has
been marked by superstition, dense ignorance, and fear.The first
doctor that history records was the Shaman, or medicine-man, whose
remedies reflected his mental status, and later found apt illustration
in the brew concocted by Macbeth's witches.And think you he has
disappeared?Unbelievable as it may seem, it was only a short time ago
that a case was reported from New York where the skin of a freshly
killed black cat was applied as a remedy for an ailment that had
refused to yield to the prescribed drugging!And only a few years ago
some one applied to the Liverpool museum for permission to touch a
sick child's head with one of the prehistoric stone axes there
exhibited.""That was mere superstition," retorted the doctor."But _materia medica_ is superstition incarnate.And because of the superstition that life and virtue and power are
resident in matter, mankind have swallowed nearly everything known to
material sense, in the hope that it would cure them of their own
auto-infection.You remember what awful recipes Luther gave for
disease, and his exclamation of gratitude: 'How great is the mercy of
God who has put such healing virtue in all manner of muck!'""Miss Carmen," resumed the doctor, "we physicians are workers, not
theorists.We handle conditions as we find them, not as they ought to
be.""You handle conditions as the
human, mortal mind believes them to be, that's all.You accept its
ugly pictures as real, and then you try desperately through
legislation to make us all accept them.Yet you would bitterly resent
it if some religious body should try to legislate its beliefs upon
you."Now listen, you doctors are rank materialists.Perhaps it is because,
as Hawthorne puts it, in your researches into the human frame your
higher and more subtle faculties are materialized, and you lose the
spiritual view of existence.Your only remedy for diseased matter is
more matter.Why, ignorance and
superstition have given rise to by far the larger number of remedies
in use by you to-day!And all of your attempts to rationalize medicine
and place it upon a systematic basis have signally failed, because the
only curative property a drug has is the credulity of the person who
swallows it.And that is a factor which varies with the individual.""The most advanced physicians give little medicine nowadays, Miss
Carmen.""They are beginning to get away from it, little by little," she
replied."In recent years it has begun to dawn upon doctors and
patients alike that the sick who recover do so, not because of the
drugs which they have taken, but _in spite of them_!One of the most
prominent of our contemporary physicians who are getting away from the
use of drugs has said that eighty-five per cent of all illnesses get
well of their own accord, no matter what may or may not be done for
them.In a very remarkable article from this same doctor's pen, in
which he speaks of the huge undertaking which physicians must assume
in order to clear away the _materia medica_ rubbish of the ages, he
states that the greatest struggle which the coming doctor has on his
hands is with drugs, and the deadly grip which they have on the
confidence and affections both of the profession and of the public.Among his illuminating remarks about the drug system, I found two
drastic statements, which should serve to lift the veil from the eyes
of the chronic drug taker.These are, first, 'Take away opium and
alcohol, and the backbone of the patent medicine business would be
broken inside of forty-eight hours,' and, second, 'No drug, save
quinine and mercury in special cases, will cure a disease.'In words
which he quotes from another prominent physician, 'He is the best
doctor who knows the worthlessness of most drugs.'"The hundreds of drugs listed in books on _materia medica_ I find are
gradually being reduced in number to a possible forty or fifty, and
one doctor makes the radical statement that they can be cut down to
the'six or seven real drugs.'Still further light has been thrown
upon the debasing nature of the drugging system by a member of the
Philadelphia Drug Exchange, in a recent hearing before the House
Committee on municipal affairs right here.He is reported as saying
that it makes little difference what a manufacturer puts into a patent
medicine, for, after all, the effect of the medicine depends upon the
faith of the user.The sick man who turns to patent medicines for
relief becomes the victim of 'bottled faith.'If his faith is
sufficiently great, a cure may be effected--and the treatment has been
_wholly mental_!The question of ethics does not concern either the
patent medicine manufacturer or the druggist, for they argue that if
the sick man's faith has been aroused to the point of producing a
cure, the formula of the medicine itself is of no consequence, and,
therefore, if a solution of sugar and water sold as a cure for colds
can stimulate the sufferer's faith to the point of meeting his need,
the business is quite legitimate.'A bunch of bottles and sentiment,'
adds this member of the Drug Exchange, 'are the real essentials for
working healing miracles.'"exclaimed the doctor, again sitting back and regarding her with
amazement."But, Doctor, I am intensely interested in my fellow-men.I want to
help them, and show them how to learn to live.""And I am doing all I can, the very best I
know how to do.""I guess you mean you are doing what you are prompted to do by every
vagrant impulse that happens to stray into your mentality, aren't
you?""You haven't really seriously thought out your
way, else you would not be here now urging Congress to spread a
blanket of ignorance over the human mind.If you will reflect
seriously, if you will lay aside monetary considerations, and a little
of the hoary prejudice of the ages, and will carefully investigate our
present medical systems, you will find a large number of schools of
medicine, bitterly antagonistic to one another, and each accusing the
other of inferiority as an exact science, and as grossly ignorant and
reprehensibly careless of life.But which of these warring schools can
show the greatest number of cures is a bit of data that has never been
ascertained.A recent writer says: 'As important as we all realize
health to be, the public is receiving treatment that is anything but
scientific, and the amount of unnecessary suffering that is going on
in the world is certainly enough to make a rock shed tears.'He
further says that, 'at least seventy-five per cent of the people we
meet who are apparently well, are suffering from some chronic ailment
that regular medical systems can not cure,' and that many of these
would try further experimentation were it not for the criticism that
is going on in the medical world regarding various curative systems.The only hope under the drugging system is that the patient's life and
purse may hold out under the strain of trying everything until he can
light upon the right thing before he reaches the end of the list.""And do you include surgery in your general criticism?""Surgery is no less an outgrowth of the belief of sentient matter than
is the drugging system," she replied."It is admittedly necessary in
the present stage of the world's thought; but it is likewise admitted
to be 'the very uncertain art of performing operations,' at least
ninety per cent of which are wholly unnecessary."You see," she went on, "the effect upon the _moral_ nature of the
sick man is never considered as rightfully having any influence upon
the choice of the system to be employed.If Beelzebub can cast out
demons, why not employ him?For, after all, the end to be attained is
the ejection of the demon.And if God had not intended minerals and
plants to be used as both food and medicine, why did He make them?Besides, man must earn his bread in some way under our present crude
and inhuman social system, and if the demand for drugs exists we may
be very sure it will be supplied by others, if not by ourselves.Again, the influence of commercialism as a determining factor in the
choice of a profession, is an influence that works to keep many in the
practice of a profession that they know to be both unscientific and
harmful.The result is an inevitable lowering of ideals to the lust of
material accumulation.""You certainly are hard on us poor doctors!And
we have done so much for you, too, despite your accusations.Think of
the babies that are now saved from diphtheria alone!""And think of the children who are the victims of the medical mania!""Think how they are brought up under the tyranny of
fear!Fear of this and of that; fear that if they scratch a finger
blood poisoning will deprive them of life; fear that eating a bit of
this will cause death; or sitting in a breeze will result in wasting
sickness!As for diphtheria antitoxin, it is in the
same class as the white of an egg.It is the
result of human belief, the belief that a horse that has recovered
from diphtheria can never again be poisoned by the microbe of that
disease.The microbe, Doctor, is the externalization in the human
mentality of the mortal beliefs of fear, of life and power in matter,
and of disease and death.The microbe will be subject, therefore, to
the human mind's changing thought regarding it, always.""Well then," said the doctor, "if people are spiritual, and if they
really are a consciousness, as you say, why do we seem to be carrying
about a body with us all the time--a body from which we are utterly
unable to get away?""It is because the mortal mind and body are one, Doctor.The body is
a lower stratum of the human mind.Hence, the so-called mind is
never distinct from its body to the extent of complete separation,
but always has its substratum with it.And, Doctor, the mind can not
hold a single thought without that thought tending to become
externalized--as Professor James tells us--and the externalization
generally has to do with the body, for the mind has come to center
all its hopes of happiness and pleasure in the body, and to base its
sense of life upon it.The body, being a mental concept formed of
false thought, passes away, from sheer lack of a definite principle
upon which to rest.Therefore the sense of life embodied in it passes
away with it.You know, the ancients had some idea of the cause of
disease when they attributed it to demons, for demons at least are
mental influences.But then, after that, men began to believe that
disease was sent by God, either to punish them for their evil deeds,
or to discipline and train them for paradise.Think
of regarding pain and suffering as divine agents!I don't wonder
people die, do you?Humboldt, you know, said: 'The time will come
when it will be considered a disgrace for a man to be sick, when the
world will look upon it as a misdemeanor, the result of some
vicious thinking.'Many people seem to think that thought affects
only the brain; but the fact is that _we think all over_!""But look here," put in the doctor."Here's a question I intended to
ask Hitt the other night.He said the five physical senses did not
testify truly.Well now, if, as you say, the eyes do not testify to
disease, then they can't testify to cures either, eh?"He sat back
with an air of triumph."The physical senses testify only to
belief.In the case of sickness, they testify to false belief.In the
case of a cure, they testify to a changed belief, to a belief of
recovered health, that is all.It is all on the basis of human belief,
you see."But--nerves feel--"

"Nerves, Doctor, like all matter, are externalizations of human
thought.Can the externalization of thought talk back to thought?You are still on the basis of mere human belief."At that moment the doctor leaned over and tapped upon the window to
attract the attention of some one in the street.Carmen looked out and
caught sight of a tall, angular man dressed in clerical garb.The man
bowed pleasantly to the doctor, and cast an inquiring glance at the
girl, then passed on."Yes, Tetham," said the doctor."Oh, is that the man who maintains the lobby here at the Capital for
his Church?He--well, it is his business to see
that members of his Church are promoted to political office, isn't it?He trades votes of whole districts to various congressmen in return
for offices for strong church members.He also got the parochial
schools of New York exempt from compulsory vaccination.The
Express--"

"Eh?Wales in his work on the cotton schedule.And so
we heard from Father Tetham.He is supporting the National Bureau of
Health bill.He is working for the Laetare medal.He--"

"Say, Miss Carmen, will you tell me where you pick up your news?Do you know something about everybody here in
Washington?""I have learned much here," she said, "about popular
government as exemplified by these United States.But it is especially saddening to see our
constitutional liberties threatened by this Bureau of Health bill, and
by the Government's constant truckling to the Church of Rome.Doctor,
can it be that you want to commit this nation to the business of
practicing medicine, and to its practice according to the allopathic,
or'regular' school?The American Medical Association, with its
reactionary policies and repressive tendencies, is making strenuous
endeavors to influence Congress to enact certain measures which would
result in the creation of such a Department of Health, the effect of
which would be to monopolize the art of healing and to create a
'healing trust.'If this calamity should be permitted to come upon the
American people, it would fall as a curtain of ignorance and
superstition over our fair land, and shut out the light of the dawning
Sun of Truth.It would mean a reversion to the blight and mold of the
Middle Ages, in many respects a return in a degree to the ignorance
and tyranny that stood for so many centuries like an impassable rock
in the pathway of human progress.The attempt to foist upon a
progressive people a system of medicine and healing which is wholly
unscientific and uncertain in its effects, but which is admittedly
known to be responsible for the death of millions and for untold
suffering and misery, and then to say, '_Thou shalt be cured thereby,
or not be cured at all_,' is an insult to the intelligence of the
Fathers of our liberties, and a crime upon a people striving for the
light.It smacks of the Holy Inquisition: You accept our creed, or you
shall go to hell--after we have broken you on the rack!Why, the
thought of subjecting this people to years of further dosing and
experimentation along the materialistic lines of the'regular' school,
of curtailing their liberties, and forcing their necks under the yoke
of medical tyranny, should come to them with the insistence of a
clarion call, and startle them into such action that the subtle evil
which lurks behind this proposed legislative action would be dragged
out into the light and exterminated!To permit commercialism and
greed, the lust of mammon, and the pride of the flesh that expresses
itself in the demand, 'Who shall be greatest?'to dictate the course
of conduct that shall shape the destinies of a great people, is to
admit the failure of free government, and to revert to a condition of
mind that we had thought long since outgrown.To yield our dear-bought
liberties to Italian ecclesiastics, on the other hand--well, Doctor,
_it is just unthinkable_!"Well, at least you are delightfully frank with me.Yet you have
the effect of making me feel as if--as if I were in some way behind a
veil.That--"

"Well, the human mind is very decidedly behind a veil--indeed, behind
many of them.Mankind just grope
about all their lives back of these veils, not knowing that God is
right before them all the time.God has got to be everything, or else
He will be nothing.With or without drugs, it is God 'who healeth all
thy diseases.'The difficulty with physicians is that they are densely
ignorant of what healing means, and so they always start with a
dreadful handicap.They believe that there is something real to be
overcome--and of course fail to permanently overcome it.Many of them
are not only pitiably ignorant, but are in the profession simply to
make money out of the fears and credulity of the people.Doctor, the
physician of to-day is in no way qualified to handle the question of
public health--especially those doctors who say: 'If you won't take
our medicines we'll get a law passed that will make you take them.'To
place the health of the people in their hands would be a terrible
mistake.The agitation for a federal Department of Health is based
upon motives of ignorance and intentional wrong.If the people
generally knew this, they would rise in a body against it.Make what
laws you wish for yourself, Doctor.The human mind is constantly
occupied in the making of ridiculous laws and limitations.But do not
attempt to foist your laws upon the people.Tell me, why all this
agitation about teaching sex-hygiene in the public schools?Why not,
for a change, teach Christianity?But even
the Bible has been put out of the schools.By your
Church, that its interpretation may continue to be falsely made by
those utterly and woefully ignorant of its true meaning!"For some moments they continued their meal in silence.Then the girl
took up the conversation again."Doctor," she said, "will you come out
from among them and be separate?""Ah, that is the rub, then!Yes, oppose ignorance and falsity, even
though incarnate in Mr."He ruins everybody who
stands in his way!The cotton schedule has gone against him, and the
whole country will have to suffer for it!""But how can he make the country suffer because he has been blocked in
his colossal selfishness?""That I can not answer," said the doctor."But I do know that he has
intimated that there will be no cotton crop in this country next
year."Ames stands as the claim of omnipotent
evil," was his laconic reply.And when the meal was ended, the girl went her way, pondering deeply.But that was something too
dark to be reported to the Express.*       *       *       *       *

Three weeks from the day he had his brush with Carmen in the presence
of the President, Ames, the great corruptionist, the master
manipulator, again returned from a visit to Washington, and in a
dangerous frame of mind.What might have been his mental state had he
known that the train which drew his private car also brought Carmen
back to New York, can only be conjectured.It was fortunate, no doubt,
that both were kept in ignorance of that fact, and that, while the
great externalization of the human mind's "claim" of business sulked
alone in his luxurious apartments, the little follower after
righteousness sat in one of the stuffy day coaches up ahead, holding
tired, fretful babies, amusing restless children, and soothing away
the long hours to weary, care-worn mothers.When the financier's car drew into the station his valets breathed
great sighs of relief, and his French chef and <DW64> porter mopped the
perspiration from their troubled brows, while silently offering peans
of gratitude for safe delivery.When the surly giant descended the car
steps his waiting footman drew back in alarm, as he caught his
master's black looks.When he threw himself into the limousine, his
chauffeur drew a low whistle and sent a timidly significant glance in
the direction of the lackey.And when at last he flung open the doors
of his private office and loudly summoned Hood, that capable and
generally fearless individual quaked with dire foreboding."The Express--I want a libel suit brought against it at once!"Yes, sir," responded the lawyer meekly.Then, in a voice trembling with
anger: "Have you read the last week's issues?"She has no financial interest in the paper, sir.And, as for the
reports which they have published--I hardly think we can establish a
case from them--"

"What?If you and he can't make out a case
against them, then I'll get a judge and a lawyer who can!I want that
bill filed to-morrow!""Very well, sir," assented Hood, stepping back."Another thing," continued Ames, "see Judge Hanson and have the
calling of the Ketchim case held in abeyance until I am ready for it.I've got a scheme to involve that <DW64> wench in the trial, and drag
her through the gutters!So, she's still in love with Rincon, eh?Well, we'll put a crimp in that little affair, I guess!Has Willett
heard from Wenceslas?""I'll lift the scalp from that blackguard Colombian prelate if he
tries to trick me!But the detectives report that he has been in Spain
recently."he exclaimed in a voice that began
high and ended in a whisper.He lapsed into a reflective mood, and for some moments his thoughts
seemed to wander far.Then he pulled himself together and roused out
of his meditations."You told Jayne that I would back the Budget to any extent, provided
it would publish the stuff I sent it?"You and Willett set about at once getting up daily
articles attacking the Express.I want you to dig up every move ever
made by Hitt, Haynerd, that girl, Waite, Morton, and the whole
miserable, sneaking outfit!Rake up every scandal, every fact, or
rumor, that is in any way associated with any of them.I want them
literally cannonaded by the Budget!Haynerd was a bum before he got the Social Era!Waite is an unfrocked
priest!That girl--that girl is
a--Did you know that she used to be in a brothel down in the red-light
district?Great record the publishers of the Express
have, eh?I want you and Jayne to bury that whole outfit
under a mountain of mud!I'm ready to spend ten millions to do it!"I think we can do it, Mr.Now, another matter: I'm out to get the President's
scalp!Begin with those New York papers which we
can influence.I'll get Fallom and Adams over here for a conference.Meanwhile, think over what we'd better say to them.Our attacks upon
the President must begin at once!I've already bought up a Washington
daily for that purpose.They have a few facts now that will discredit
his administration!"Ah--a--there is a matter that I must mention as
soon as you are ready to hear it, Mr.It seems
that the reports which that girl has made have been translated into
several languages, and are being used by labor agitators down there to
stir up trouble.The mill hands, you know, never really understood
what your profits were, and--well, they have always been quite
ignorant, you know, regarding any details of the business.But now
they think they have been enlightened--they think they see how the
tariff has benefited you at their expense--and they are extremely
bitter against you.That priest, Father Danny, has been doing a lot of
talking since the girl was down there."cried Ames, rising from his chair, then sinking back again.Ames," the lawyer continued, "the situation is fast
becoming acute.The mill hands don't believe now that you were ever
justified in shutting down, or putting them on half time.And, whether
you reduce wages or not, they are going to make very radical demands
upon you in the near future, unless I am misinformed.These demands
include better working conditions, better tenements, shorter hours,
and very much higher wages.Also the enforcement of the child labor
law, I am sorry to say."Ames, you know you have said that it would
strengthen your case with Congress if there should be a strike at
Avon."I am
distinctly out of favor with the President--owing to that little <DW64>
wench!And Congress is going against me if I lose Gossitch, Logue, and
Mall!That girl has put me in bad down there!By G--"

"But, Mr.Ames, she can be removed, can she not?"But--if we can drive the
Express upon the shoals, and then utterly discredit that girl, either
in the libel suit or the Ketchim trial, why, then, with a little show
of bettering things at Avon, we'll get what we want.Say, is--is Sidney with the Express?"Hood started, and shot a look of mingled surprise and curiosity at his
master.Was it possible that Ames--

"You heard my question, Mr.Yes, sir--Sidney is still with them.He--a--they say
he has quite conquered his--his--"

"You mean, he's no longer a sot?"Don't sit there like a smirking Chinese god!"Ames, I learn that Sidney has been cured of his habits, and
that the--that girl--did it," stammered the nervous lawyer.Ames's mouth jerked open--and then snapped shut.His
head slowly sank until his chin touched his breast.And as he sat thus
enwrapped, Hood rose and noiselessly left the room.Alone sat the man of gold--ah, more alone than even he knew.Alone
with his bruised ambitions, his hectored egoism, his watery aims.Alone and plotting the ruin of those who had dared bid him halt in his
mad, destroying career.Alone, this high priest of the caste of
absolutism, of the old individualism which is fast hurrying into the
realm of the forgotten.Alone, and facing a new century, with whose
ideals his own were utterly, stubbornly, hopelessly discrepant.Alone he sat, looking out, unmoved, upon the want and pain of
countless multitudes gone down beneath the yoke of conditions which he
had made too hard for them.Looking, unmoved, unhearing, upon the
bitter struggles of the weak, the ignorant, the unskilled, the gross
hewers of wood and drawers of water.Looking, and knowing not that in
their piteous cry for help and light was sounded his own dire peril.The door opened, and the office boy announced the chief stenographer
of the great bank below.Ames looked up and silently nodded permission
for the man to enter.Ames," the clerk began, "I--I have come to ask a favor--a
great favor.I am having difficulty--considerable difficulty in
securing stenographers, but--I may say--my greatest struggle is
with myself.Ames, I can not--I simply can not continue to
hire stenographers at the old wage, nine dollars a week!I know how
these girls are forced to live.Ames, with prices where they
are now, they can not live on that!Say,
ten or twelve dollars to start with?""Why do you come to me with your request?""Yes, sir, I know," replied the young man with hesitation."But--I--did
speak to him about it, and--he refused.""I can do nothing, sir," returned Ames in a voice that chilled the
man's life-current.I refuse to remain here and hire
stenographers at that criminal wage!""Very well, sir," replied Ames in the same low, freezing tone.Again the guardian of the sanctity of private property was left alone.Again, as he lapsed into dark revery, his thought turned back upon
itself, and began the reconstruction of scenes and events long since
shadowy dreams.And always as they built, the fair face of that young
girl appeared in the fabric.And always as he retraced his course, her
path crossed and crossed again his own.Always as he moved, her
reflection fell upon him--not in shadow, but in a flood of light,
exposing the secret recesses of his sordid soul.He dwelt again upon the smoothness of his way in those days, before
her advent, when that group of canny pirates sat about the Beaubien's
table and laid their devious snares.It was only the summer before she
came that this same jolly company had merged their sacred trust assets
to draw the clouds which that autumn burst upon the country as the
worst financial panic it had known in years.And so shrewdly had they
planned, that the storm came unheralded from a clear sky, and at a
time when the nation was never more prosperous.They had wagered that he could not put it
through.How neatly he had turned the trick, filled his pockets, and
transformed their doubts into wondering admiration!Oh, yes, there had been some suffering, he had been told.How surprised the people of these United
States would be some day to learn that this tropic struggle was in
essence an American war!The smug and unthinkingly contented in this
great country of ours regarded the frenzied combat in the far South as
but a sort of _opera bouffe_.And he,
when that war should end, would control navigation on the great
Magdalena and Cauca rivers, and acquire a long-term lease on the
emerald mines near Bogota.Untold suffering--countless
broken hearts--indescribable, maddening torture--he had not given that
a thought.His trip to Washington had been
exhausting.His eyes had been bloodshot,
and there had been several slight hemorrhages from the nose.His
physician had shaken his head gravely, and had admonished him to be
careful--

But why did that girl continue to fascinate him?Why now,
in all his scheming and plotting, did he always see her before him?Was it only because of her rare physical beauty?If he wrote or read,
her portrait lay upon the page; if he glanced up, she stood there
facing him.There was never accusation in her look, never malice, nor
trace of hate.No; but always she
smiled--always she looked right into his eyes--always she seemed to
say, "You would destroy me, but yet I love you."Aye, much more so than he did her.She would scorn the use of his
methods.He had to admit _that_, though he hated her, detested her,
would have torn her into shreds--even while he acknowledged that he
admired her, yes, beyond all others, for her wonderful bravery and her
loyal stand for what she considered the right.He must have dozed while he sat there in the warm office alone.Surely, that hideous object now floating before his straining gaze,
that thing resembling the poor, shattered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, was not
real!It was but a shadow, a flimsy thing of thought!And that
woestricken thing there, with its tenuous arms extended toward
him--was that Gannette?But, that other shade--so like his wife, a few months dead, yet alive
again!Whence came that look of horror in a face once so haughty!It
was unreal, ghastly unreal, as it drifted past!Ah, now he knew that
he was dreaming, for there, there in the light stood Carmen!Oh, what
a blessed relief to see that fair image there among those other
ghastly sights!He would speak to her--

But--_God above_!_What was that?_ A woman--no, not Carmen--fair
and--

Her white lips moved--they were transparent--he could see right
through them--and great tears dropped from her bloodless cheeks when
her accusing look fell upon him!Slowly she floated nearer--she stopped before him, and laid a hand
upon his shoulder--it was cold, cold as ice!He tried to call out--to
rise--to break away--

And then, groaning aloud, and with his brow dripping perspiration, he
awoke.Hood entered, but stopped short when he saw his master's white face.Ames passed a hand across his wet forehead."A--a little tired, that's
all, I guess.The lawyer laid a large envelope upon the desk."There's a delegation of Avon mill hands in the outer office.Again he
seemed to see that smiling girl before him.His jaw set, and his face
drew slowly down into an expression of malignity.Then, without
examining its contents, he tore the envelope into shreds, and cast the
pieces into the waste basket."Wire Pillette at
once to discharge these fellows, and every one else concerned in the
agitation!If those rats down there want to fight, they'll find me
ready!"CHAPTER 14


The immense frame of J. Wilton Ames bent slightly, and the great legs
might have been seen to drag a bit, as the man entered his private
elevator the morning after his rejection of the mill hands' demands,
and turned the lever that caused the lift to soar lightly to his
office above.And a mouse--had the immaculate condition of his
luxurious _sanctum_ permitted such an alien dweller--could have seen
him sink heavily into his great desk chair, and lapse into deep
thought.Hood, Willett, and Hodson entered in turn; but the magnate
gave them scant consideration, and at length waved them all away, and
bent anew to his meditations.Truth to tell--though he would not have owned it--the man was now
dimly conscious of a new force at work upon him; of a change, slowly,
subtly taking place somewhere deep within.He was feebly cognizant of
emotions quite unknown; of unfamiliar sentiments, whose outlines were
but just crystallizing out from the thick magma of his materialistic
soul.And he fought them; he hated them; they made him appear unto himself
weak, even effeminate!His abhorrence of sentimentalism had been among
the strongest of his life-characteristics; and yet, though he could
not define it, a mellowing something seemed to be acting upon him that
dull, bitterly cold winter morning, that shed a soft glow throughout
his mental chambers, that seemed to touch gently the hard, rugged
things of thought that lay within, and soften away their sharp
outlines.He might not know what lay so heavily upon his thought, as
he sat there alone, with his head sunk upon his breast.And yet the
girl who haunted his dreams would have told him that it was an
interrogation, even the eternal question, "What shall it profit a
man--?"Had ever such heavenly music touched his ears before!He would have held out his arms to her if he could.And yet, how dared she come to him?How dared she, after what she had
done?To
stand within the protection which her sex afforded and vivisect anew
his tired soul?But, whatever her motives, this girl did the most
daring things he had ever seen a woman do."Isn't it funny," she said, as she stood before him with a whimsical
little smile, "that wherever I go people so seldom ask me to sit
down!"Ames sank back into his seat without speaking.Carmen stood for a
moment looking about her rich environment; then drew up a chair close
to him."You haven't the slightest idea why I have come here, have you?"she
said sweetly, looking up into his face."I must confess myself quite ignorant of the cause of this unexpected
pleasure," he returned guardedly, bending his head in mock deference,
while the great wonder retained possession of him."Well," she went on lightly, "will you believe me when I tell you that
I have come here because I love you?"So this was an attack from
a different quarter!Hitt and Haynerd had invoked her feminine wiles,
eh?With one blow the unfamiliar sentiment which had been
shedding its influence upon him that morning laid the ugly suspicion
dead at his feet.A single glance into that sweet face turned so
lovingly up to his brought his own deep curse upon himself for his
hellish thought."You know," she bubbled, with a return of her wonted airy gaiety, "I
just had to run the gauntlet through guards and clerks and office boys
to get here.Aren't you glad I didn't send in my card?For then you
would have refused to see me, wouldn't you?""If I
had known you were out there," he said more gently, "I'd have sent out
and had you dragged in.I--I have wanted something this morning; and
now I am sure it was--"

"Yes," she interrupted, taking the words out of his mouth, "you wanted
_me_.You see, it's just absolutely impossible to
oppose anybody who loves you.You know, that's the very method Jesus
gave for overcoming our enemies--to love them, just love them to
pieces, until we find that we haven't any enemies at all any more.Well, that's the way I've been doing with
you--just loving you."The man's brows knotted, and his lips tightened.Or was there aught but the deepest sincerity expressed
in the face from which he could not take his eyes?And
yet, did ever human being talk so strangely, so weirdly, as she?"I thought you looked upon me as a human monster."After all,
there was a note of pathos in the question.Carmen laid her hand upon
his."It's the _real_ you that I love," she answered gently."The monster
is only human thought--the thought that has seemed to mesmerize you.But you are going to throw off the mesmerism, aren't you?I'll help
you," she added brightly."You're going to put off the 'old man'
completely--and you're going to begin by opening yourself and letting
in a little love for those poor people down at Avon, aren't you?At the mention of the people of Avon his face became stern and dark.She had not mentioned the Beaubien,
Miss Wall, the Express, nor herself."You see, you don't understand, Mr.You'll be, oh, so surprised
some day when you learn a little about the laws of thought--even the
way human thought operates!For you can't possibly do another person
an injury without that injury flying back and striking you.You may not feel the effects of its return right
away--but it does return, and the effects accumulate.And then, some
day, when you least expect it, comes the crash!But, when you love a
person, why, that comes back to you too; and it never comes alone.It
just brings loads of good with it.Ames," she cried, suddenly rising and seizing both his hands,
"you've just _got_ to love those people down there!You can't help it,
even if you think you can, for hate is not real--it's an awful
delusion!"It was not so much an appeal which the girl made as an affirmation of
things true and yet to come.The mighty _Thou shalt not!_ which Moses
laid upon his people, when transfused by the omnipotent love of the
Christ was transformed from a clanking chain into a silken cord.The
restriction became a prophecy; for when thou hast yielded self to the
benign influence of the Christ-principle, then, indeed, thou shalt not
desire to break the law of God.Carmen returned to her chair, and sat eagerly expectant.Ames groped
within his thought for a reply.And then his mental grasp closed upon
the words of Hood."They are very bitter against me--they hate me!""They reflect in kind your thought of
them.Your boomerangs of greed, of exploitation, of utter indifference
which you have hurled at them, have returned upon you in hatred.Do
you know that hatred is a fearful poison?And do you know that
another's hatred resting upon you is deadly, unless you know how to
meet and neutralize it with love?For love is the neutralizing
alkaloid.""Love is--weakness," he said in a low tone.Why, there is no such mighty power in the whole
universe as love!"We argue from different
standpoints," he said."I am a plain, matter-of-fact, cold-blooded
business man."And that," she replied in a voice tinged with sadness, "is why
business is such chaos; why there is so much failure, so much anxiety,
fear, loss, and unhappiness in the business world.Ames, you
haven't the slightest conception of real business, have you?"Then, brightly, "I am in business,
Mr.The business of
attempting to annihilate me!""I am in the business of reflecting good to you, and to all mankind,"
she gently corrected."Then suppose you manifest your love for me by refraining from
meddling further in my affairs.Suppose from now on you let me
alone.""Why--I am not meddling with you, Mr.He opened a drawer of the desk and took out several copies of
the Express."I am to consider that this is not strictly meddling,
eh?"he continued, as he laid the papers before her."No, not at all," she promptly replied."That's uncovering evil, so's
it can be destroyed.All that evil, calling itself you and your
business, has got to come to the surface--has got to come up to the
light, so that it can be--"

"Ah!Then I, the monster, must be exposed, eh?And the mines and mills which I
own--"

"You own nothing, Mr.Ames, except by consent of the people whom you
oppress.They will wake up some day; and then state and national
ownership of public utilities will come, forced by such as you.""And that desideratum will result in making everybody honest, I
suppose?"All our
present troubles, whether domestic, business, civic, or social, come
from a total misapprehension of the nature of God--a misunderstanding
of what is really _good_.We have _all_ got to prove Him.And we are
very foolish to lose any more time setting about it, don't you think
so?"You see," she went on, while he sat studying her, "those poor people
down at Avon don't know any more about what is the real good than you
do.And that's why their thoughts and yours center upon the false
pleasures of this ephemeral existence called life--this existence of
the so-called physical senses--and why you both become the tools of
vice, disease, and misfortune.They build up such men as you, and then
you turn about and crush them.And in the end you are both what the
Bible says--poor, deluded fools.""Well, I'll be--"

"Oh, don't swear!"she pleaded, again seizing his hand and laughing up
into his face."It's time you started to prove God," she said earnestly."Won't you
begin now--to-day?Haven't you yet learned that evil is the very
stupidest, dullest, most uninteresting thing in the world?Won't you turn from your material endeavors now, and take time
to learn to really live?You've got plenty of time, you know, for you
aren't obliged to work for a living."She was leaning close to him, and her breath touched his cheek.Her
soft little hand lay upon his own.And her great, dark eyes looked
into his with a light which he knew, despite his perverted thought,
came from the unquenchable flame of her selfless love.Again that unfamiliar sentiment--nay, rather, that sentiment long
dormant--stirred within him.Again his worldly concepts, long
entrenched, instantly rose to meet and overthrow it.He had not yet
learned to analyze the thoughts which crept so silently into his
ever-open mentality.And to those
which savored of things earthy he still gave the power to build, with
himself as a willing tool."You will--help me--to live?"He thought her the most
gloriously beautiful object he had ever known, as she sat there before
him, so simply gowned, and yet clothed with that which all the gold of
Ophir could not have bought."Yes, gladly--oh, so gladly!"Her eyes sparkled with a rush of tears."Don't you think," he said gently, drawing his chair a little closer
to her, "that we have quite misunderstood each other?"But," with a happy smile
again lighting her features, "we can understand each other now, can't
we?"And hasn't the time come for us to work together,
instead of continuing to oppose each other?""I--I have been thinking so ever since I returned yesterday from
Washington.I am--I--"

"We need each other, don't we?"the artless girl exclaimed, as she
beamed upon him."I can help
you--more than you realize--and I want to.I--I've been sorry for you,
little girl, mighty sorry, ever since that story got abroad about--"

"Oh, never mind that!""We are living in the
present, you know."And I
want to see them straightened out.And you and I can do it, little
one.Madam Beaubien hasn't been treated right, either."We're going to
forget that in the good we're going to do, aren't we?"And you are going to get a square deal.Now, I've got
a plan to make everything right.I want to see you in the place that
belongs to you.I want to see you happy, and surrounded by all that is
rightfully yours.And if you will join me, we will bring that all
about.I told you this once before, you may remember."He stopped and awaited the effect of his words upon the girl.Ames," she replied, her eyes shining with a great hope,
"don't think about me!It's the people at Avon that I want to help.""We'll help them, you and I. We'll make things right all round.And
Madam Beaubien shall have no further trouble."Sidney shall come home--"

With a rush the impulsive girl, forgetting all but the apparent
success of her mission, threw herself upon him and clasped her arms
about his neck."Oh," she cried, "it is love that has done all this!The startled man strained the girl tightly in his arms.He could feel
the quick throbbing in her throat.Her warm breath played upon his
cheek like fitful tropic breezes.For a brief moment the supreme gift
of the universe seemed to be laid at his feet.For a fleeting interval
the man of dust faded, and a new being, pure and white, seemed to rise
within him."Yes," he murmured gently, "we'll take him to our home with us."Slowly, very slowly, the girl released herself from his embrace and
stepped back.she murmured, searching his face for the
meaning which she had dimly discerned in his words.He reached forward and with a quick movement seized her
hand.Not now--no, you
needn't come to me until you are ready.Why, I didn't know until to-day what it was that was making
me over!Don't--"

Carmen had struggled away from him, and, with a look of bewilderment
upon her face, was moving toward the door."Oh, I didn't know," she
murmured, "that you were--were--proposing _marriage_ to me!"We'll begin all over again, you and I!Why, I'll do anything--anything
in the world you say, Carmen, if you will come to me--if you will be
my little wife!"I know--I know," he hastily resumed, as she halted and stood
seemingly rooted to the floor, "there is a great difference in our
ages.But that is nothing--many happy marriages are made between ages
just as far apart as ours.I'll make Madam Beaubien rich!I'll support the
Express, and make it what you want it to be!I'll do whatever you say
for the people of Avon!Think, little girl, what depends now upon
you!"Carmen turned and came slowly back to him."And--you will not do these
things--unless I marry you?"she said in a voice scarcely above a
whisper."I will do them all, Carmen, if you will come to me!""But--oh, you were only deceiving me all the time!And now--if I
refuse--then what?""It depends upon you, entirely--and you will come?Not now--but within
the next few months--within the year--tell me that you will!""But--you will do these things whether I come to you or not?""I've put it all into your hands," he answered shortly.Then
she glanced about in helpless bewilderment."I--I--love--you," she murmured, as she looked off toward the window,
but with unseeing eyes."I would do anything for you that was right.I--love--everybody--everybody; but there are no conditions to _my_
love.she suddenly cried, burying her face in her hands and
bursting into tears."You have tried to _buy_ me!"Taking her by the hand he led her,
unresisting, back to her chair."Listen," he said, bending toward her."Go home now and think it
all over.It was sudden, I admit; I
took you by surprise.But--well, you are not going to prevent the
accomplishment of all that good, are you?She had been crushed; and
another lesson in the cruelty of the human mind--that human mind which
has changed not in a thousand years--had been read to her.But again
she smiled bravely, as she wiped her eyes."It's all right now," she murmured."It was all right all the
time--and I was protected.""Some day," she said gently, and in a voice
that trembled just a little, "you will help the people of Avon, but
not because I shall marry you."Then you refuse my offer, do you?""Remember, all the blame will be upon you.She saw now with a clairvoyance which separated
him from the mask which he had worn.Her glance penetrated until it
found his soul."You have shown me the depths of the carnal mind," she slowly replied."The responsibility is not with me, but with--God.I--I came to-day
to--to help you.But now I must leave you--with Him."He stooped and took up her muff which lay upon the floor.As he did so,
a letter fell out.He seized it and glanced at the superscription.Another little _billet-doux_ to your
priestly lover, eh?"She looked down at the letter which he held."It is money," she said,
though her thought seemed far away."Money that I am sending to a
little newsboy who bears his name."He rose and opened a drawer in his desk.Taking out a paper-bound
book, he held it out to the girl."Here's a
little piece of work which your brilliant lover did some time ago.Do you know the penalty your
clerical paramour paid for that, eh?Then I'll tell you," bending over
close to her ear, "his _life_!"She staggered
a few steps toward the door, then stopped."God--is--is--_everywhere_!"Then she reeled, and fell heavily to the floor.CHAPTER 15


If additional proof of the awful cost of hating one's fellow-men were
required, the strike which burst upon the industrial world that winter
must furnish it in sickening excess.But other facts, too, were
rendered glaringly patent by that same desperate clash which made Avon
a shambles and transformed its fair name into a by-word, to be spoken
only in hushed whispers when one's thought dwells for a moment upon
the madness of the carnal mind that has once tasted blood.The
man-cleft chasm between labor and capital, that still unbridged void
which separates master and servant, and which a money-drunk class
insolently calls God-made, grows wider with each roar of musketry
aimed by a frenzied militia at helpless men and women; grows deeper
with each splitting crack of the dynamite that is laid to tear asunder
the conscienceless wielder of the goad; and must one day fall gaping
in a cavernous embouchure that will engulf a nation.Hitt saw it, and shuddered; Haynerd, too.Ames may have dimly marked
the typhoon on the horizon, but, like everything that manifested
opposition to this superhuman will, it only set his teeth the firmer
and thickened the callous about his cold heart.And she knew--and the world must some day know--that but one tie has
ever been designed adequate to bridge this yawning canon of human
hatred.Aye, well she knew that the world laughed,
and called it chimera; called it idealism, and emotional weakness.And well she knew that the most pitiable weakness the world has ever
seen was the class privilege which nailed the bearer of the creed of
love upon the cross, and to-day manifests in the frantic grasping of a
nation's resources, and the ruthless murder of those who ask that
they, too, may have a share in that abundance which is the common
birthright of all.Do the political bully, the grafter, the tout, know
the meaning of love?Oh, not by the
hypocritical millionaire pietists who prate their glib platitudes to
their Sunday Bible classes, and return to their luxurious homes to
order the slaughter of starving women and babes!They, like their poor
victims, are deep under the spell of that mesmerism which tells them
that evil is good.Nor by the Church, with its lamentable weakness of
knowledge and works.Only by those who have learned something of the
Christ-principle, and are striving daily to demonstrate its
omnipotence in part, can the world be taught a saving knowledge of the
love that solves every problem and creates a new heaven and a newer,
better concept of the earth and its fullness.That morning when Carmen went to see Ames the Express received word of
the walk-out of the Avon mill employes.Almost coincident with the
arrival of the news, Carmen herself came unsteadily into Hitt's
office.The editor glanced up at her, then looked a second time.He
had never before seen her face colorless."What work have you--for me--to-day?"Then, so low that he scarcely caught the
words, "I--I have been with--a friend."Sidney Ames came puffing into the office at that moment."How does it happen you're out riding with
Willett?Saw him help you out of an auto just now.""He brought me here," she answered softly.Hitt and the lad stared at her with open mouths.She turned, and
started for her own room, moving as if in a haze.As she neared the
door she stumbled.Sidney sprang after her and caught her in his arms.When she turned her face, they saw that her eyes were swimming in
tears.Hitt closed the door after him, then took
the girl's hand and led her back to his own chair."Now, little one,"
he said gently, "tell me all about it."Then the tears began to flow; and then she
leaned her head against him and sobbed--sobbed as does the stricken
mother who hangs over the lifeless form of her babe--sobbed as does
the strong man bereft of the friend of his bosom--sobbed as did the
Man of Sorrow, when he held out his arms over the worldly city that
cruelly rejected him.He was the channel for the divine; yet the
wickedness of the human mind broke his great heart.Carmen was not far
from him at that moment.Hitt held her hand, and choked back the lump that filled his throat.Then the weeping slowly ceased, and the girl looked up into his
anxious face."It's all past now," she said brokenly."Jesus forgave them that
killed him.And--"

"You have been with--Ames?"said Hitt in a low, quiet tone."And he
tried to kill you?""He--he knew not what he was doing.Evil used him, because as
yet he has no spiritual understanding."Well, little girl, I am waiting for the whole story.It
didn't happen--it wasn't real.I--I seemed to manifest weakness--and I
fell--to the floor--but I didn't lose consciousness."But what had Ames said to you, Carmen?"persisted Hitt, his face dark
with anger.Ames only as--as God's child," she
murmured."Evil is not real, and it doesn't happen.Now I want to
work--work as I never did before!_I must!_"

"Will you not tell me more about it?"he asked, for he knew now that a
deadly thrust had been made at the girl's life."It didn't happen," was her
reply.A suspicion flashed into Hitt's mind, kindled by the girl's insistence
upon the nothingness of death."Carmen," he asked, "did he tell you
that--some one had died?"She came to him and laid her head against him.I shall overcome it, for God is with me.Promise that no
one but us shall know!The man's eyes grew moist, and his throat filled.He drew the girl to
him and kissed her forehead."It shall be as you wish, little one," he
said in a choking voice.This is another
opportunity to--to prove God!He turned to his desk with a heavy heart."There is work to be done
now," he said."I wonder--"

She took the telegram from his hands and scanned it.At once she
became calm, her own sorrow swallowed up in selfless love."Oh, they
have gone out at Avon!Hitt, I must go there at once!""I thought so," he replied, swallowing hard.But you are in higher hands than mine, Carmen.And we, Sidney and I, will
say nothing of--of your visit to his father."*       *       *       *       *

That night Hitt called up the Beaubien and asked if he and Haynerd
might come and talk with her after the paper had gone to press, and
requesting that she notify Carmen and Father Waite.A few hours later
the little group met quietly in the humble cottage.Miss Wall and
Sidney were with them.And to them all those first dark hours of
morning, when as yet the symbol of God's omnipresence hung far below
the horizon, seemed prescient with a knowledge of evil's further
claims to the lives and fortunes of men."I have asked you here," Hitt gravely announced when they were
assembled, "to consider a matter which touches us all--how deeply, God
alone knows.At ten o'clock to-night I received this message."He
opened the paper which he held in his hand and read:

  "'Property of Hitt oil company, including derricks, pump houses,
  storage tanks, destroyed by fire.Dynamite in pump houses
  exploded, causing wells to cave and choke.The news burst over them like the cracking of a bomb.Haynerd, who,
like the others, had been kept in ignorance of the message until now,
started from his chair with a loud exclamation, then sank back limp.Evil seemed to have chosen that day with
canny shrewdness to overwhelm her with its quick sallies from out the
darkness of the carnal mind."I see in this," he said slowly, "the
culmination of a long series of efforts to ruin the Express.That my
oil property was deliberately wrecked, I have not the slightest doubt.demanded Haynerd, having again found his voice."The Express has stood before the world as a
paper unique and apart.And because of its high ideals, the forces of
evil singled it out at the beginning for their murderous assaults.That the press of this country is very generally muzzled, stifled,
bought and paid for, I have good reason now to know.My constant
brushes with the liquor interests, with low politicians, judges,
senators, and dive-keepers, have not been revealed even to you.Could
you know the pressure which the Church, both Catholic and Protestant,
has tried to exert upon us, you would scarce credit me with veracity.But the Express has stood out firm against feudalism, mediaevalism,
and entrenched ecclesiasticism.It has fearlessly opposed the
legalizing of drugging.It has fought the debauching of a nation's
manhood by the legalized sale of a deadly poison, alcohol.And it has
fought without quarter the pernicious activity of morally stunted
brewers and distillers, whose hellish motto is, 'Make the boys drink!'It has fought the money octopus, and again and again has sounded to
the world the peril which money-drunken criminals like Ames and his
clique constitute.And for that we must now wear the crown of
martyrdom!"Silence, dismal and empty, lay over the little room for a long time."The Express has not been self-supporting.Its
growth has been steady, but it has depended for its deficit upon the
revenue from my oil property.Ames ruined Madam
Beaubien financially, as well as Miss Wall.And now, knowing that we all depended upon my oil wells, he has, I
doubt not, completely removed that source of income.""But," exclaimed Haynerd, "your property was insured, wasn't it?""Yes," replied Hitt, with a feeble attempt at a smile."But with the
proviso that dynamite should not be kept on the premises.You will
note that dynamite wrecked the wells.That doubtless renders my
policies void.But, even in case I should have a fighting chance with
the insurance companies, don't you think that they will be advised
that I purposely set fire to the wells, in order to collect the
insurance?And I shall find myself with a big
lawsuit on my hands, and with no funds to conduct the fight.Ames's
work, you know, is always thorough, and the Express is already facing
his suit for libel.""But you told us you were going to mortgage your property," said Miss
Wall."I stood ready to, should the Express require it.But, with its recent
little boom, our paper did not seem to need that as yet," he
returned."Yes, Ned, God _is_ good!""Can you say that, after all you have
endured, Carmen?"He looked at her for a moment, lost in wonder."An outcast babe," he
murmured, "left on the banks of a great river far, far away; reared
without knowledge of father or mother, and amid perils that hourly
threatened to crush her; torn from her beloved ones and thrust out
into an unknown and unsympathetic world; used as a stepping-stone to
advance the low social ambitions of worldly women; blackened by the
foulest slander, and ejected as an outcast by those who had fawned at
her feet; still going about with her beautiful message of love, even
though knowing that her childhood home is enveloped in the flames of
war, and her dear ones scattered, perhaps lost; spurned from the door
of the rich man whom she sought to save; carrying with her always the
knowledge that the one upon whom her affections had centered had a son
in distant Cartagena, and yet herself contributing to the support of
the little lad; and now, this morning--" He stopped, for he remembered
his promise."This morning," she finished, "shielded by the One who is both Father
and Mother to me.""That One surely ought to love you, Carmen--"

"He does," she answered softly.put in Haynerd, torn with anger and fear."What are we going
to do now?""Everything, Ned, that error seems to tell us not to do," replied the
girl.She reached over to the little table that stood near, and took from it
a Bible.Opening it, she read aloud, very slowly, the entire
fourteenth chapter of Exodus.Then she concluded by reading the last
two verses of the eighth chapter of Romans."Now," she said, looking up, "we know what we are going to do, don't
we?We are going right on, as'seeing Him who is invisible' to men
like Mr."There is no curse, whether of the Church, or of business, or of any
department of human thought, that can overthrow legitimate business;
and we are in the legitimate business of reflecting God to the world.If the physical sense of supply is now lost, we are fortunate, for now
we are obliged to acquire a higher sense.And we become aware of it in our own consciousness.It is there
that we interpret His supply.Ames interprets it one way; we, in a
very different way.God has always been able to prepare a table in the
wilderness of human thought.If we look for supply from without, we
shall not find it, for everything is within.And the very fact that
there is a legitimate demand shows that there is the supply to meet
it, for--though the world hasn't learned this yet--_it is the supply
itself that really creates the demand_!""Money, Ned, is the counterfeit of God.He is
our Principle--infinite, inexhaustible.We are facing a crisis, but, like every seeming disturbance of
the infinite harmony, it will vanish in a little while if we but cling
to the divine Mind that is God for guidance."Hitt folded the telegram and returned it to his pocket."Are you going
to Avon to-morrow?""And when we have in our midst this girl, who has borne,
without one word of complaint or reviling, the world's most poignant
sorrows!I--I really regret that I told you of--of this telegram.I
seemed for a moment to be overwhelmed.But I am on my feet again
now!"He reached into a pocket and took out some bills, which he handed to
Carmen."That will see you through for a day or so down there.Come," he added,
beckoning to Haynerd, "the Express will be issued to-morrow as usual,
and we must get to bed.I've really had quite a strenuous day!"He
turned, then paused and looked at Carmen.The girl caught the meaning in his glance, and went directly to the
piano."Don't," he said, "if you do not feel like it.This day has been a
hard one for you, I know.And--"

"But I do feel like it," she answered, smiling up at him.And," her voice dropped low, "I want to sing to--Him."Hitt gulped down something in his throat."The bravest little girl in
the whole wide world!"*       *       *       *       *

The carnage at Avon was not incidental; it was the logical effect of
definite mental causes.It was the orderly sequence of an endless
train of hatred of man for man, bred of greed and the fear of
starvation.And starvation is the externalized human belief that life
is at the caprice of intelligent matter.But that is an infraction of
the first Commandment, given when the human race was a babe.When the mill hands left their looms at evening of the day following
Ames's rejection of their demands, the master closed the doors behind
them and locked them out.The parrot-cry of the maudlin sentimental!But, four thousand men, women, and little children, with never a
dollar beyond their earnings of the day, thrust out into the blasts of
the bitterest winter the New England states had known in years!True; but why, then, did they strike?For, you see, that of itself
proved the soundness of Ames's single reply to all further appeal:
"There is nothing whatever to arbitrate."In the garden of the human mind waves many a flower, both black and
red, fanned by the foul winds of carnal thought.There grow the
brothel, the dive, the gin-shop, the jail.About these hardier stems
twine the hospital, the cemetery, the madhouse, the morgue.And Satan,
"the man-killer from the beginning," waters their roots and makes
fallow the soil with the blood of fools.But of those for whom the
gardener waits, there is none whose blood is so life-giving to these
noxious plants as that type of the materially rich who, like Ames,
have waxed gross upon the flesh of their own brothers.Ames was a gambler in human lives.They were his chips, by which he
gained or lost, and of themselves were void of intrinsic value.The
world was the table whereon he played; the game _rouge et noir_, with
the whirl of predatory commercialism as the wheel, and the ball
weighted to drop where he might direct.He carried millions on margin,
and with them carried the destinies, for weal or for woe, of millions
of his fellow-men, with not one thought that he did so at the cost of
their honor and morality, not less than their life-blood.It had been his custom to close his mills for several months each
year, in order to save expense when times were dull.And he did this
as casually as he closed the doors of his stables, and with much less
thought for the welfare of those concerned.It is doubtful if he had
ever really considered the fact that these four thousand human beings
were wholly dependent upon him for their very existence.For he was a
business man, and gold was far weightier in the scale of values than
human flesh, and much less easily obtained.Cain's comforting
philosophy was quite correct, else would the business world not have
been so firmly established upon it.Besides, he was terribly busy; and
his life was lived upon a plane high, high above that upon which these
swarming toilers groveled with their snouts in the dust.And now, with the doors of his mills barred against the hungry hordes,
he would frame the terms upon which they should be reopened.The
eight-hour law must not be enforced.Perhaps he could influence the
Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, as depriving the mill
hands of the right to labor as long as they pleased.And the right to organize and band together for their
common good would be contemptuously denied the ignorant rats who
should be permitted to toil for him once more.If they offered
violence, there was the state militia, armed and impatient to slay.Also, this was an excellent opportunity to stamp out trade-unionism
within the confines of his activities.He would win the plaudits of
the whole industrial world by so doing.He therefore immediately got
in touch with the Governor, a Tammany puppet, and received that loyal
henchman's warm assurances of hearty support for any measures which
the great magnate might wish to enforce.He then approached the
officers of the state guard, and secured them to a man.Times were
hard, and they welcomed his favor.He finally posted armed guards in
all his buildings at Avon, and bade them remember that property rights
were of divine institution.Then he sat down and dictated the general
policy to be followed by the Amalgamated Spinners' Association
throughout the country in support of his own selfish ends.His activity in these preparations, as in everything, was tremendous.His agents swarmed over the state like ants.The Catholic Archbishop
was instructed that he must remove Father Danny from Avon, as his
influence was pernicious.But the objection was made that the priest
was engaged only in humanitarian labors.It availed not; Ames desired
the man's removal.The widow Marcus likewise had
been doing much talking.Ames's lawyer, Collins, had her haled into
court and thoroughly reprimanded.And then, that matters might be
precipitated, and Congress duly impressed with the necessity of
altering the cotton schedule in favor of the Spinners' Association,
Ames ordered his agents to raise the rents of his miserable Avon
tenements.There were few, he knew, who dared even attempt to meet the
raise; and those who could not, he ordered set into the streets.It was a wild winter's day that the magnate chose for the enforcement
of this cruel order.A driving blizzard had raged throughout the
night, and the snow had banked up in drifts in places many feet deep.The temperature was freezing, and the strong east wind cut like a
knife.It was Ames's desire to teach these scum a needed lesson, and
he had chosen to enlist the elements to aid him in the righteous
task.For a week, ever since the strike was declared, Carmen had lived among
these hectored people.Daily her reports of the unbearable situation
had gone to Hitt.And through them the editor had daily striven to
awaken a nation's conscience.Ames read the articles, and through the
columns of the Budget sought to modify them to the extent of shifting
the responsibility to the shoulders of the mill hands themselves, and
to a dilatory Congress that was criminally negligent in so framing a
cotton tariff as to make such industrial suffering possible.Nor did
he omit to foully vilify the Express and calumniate its personnel.Amid curses, screams, and despairing wails, the satanic work of
ejecting the tenement dwellers went on that day.Ames's hirelings,
with loaded rifles, assisted the constables and city police in the
miserable work, themselves cursing often because of the keen blasts
that nipped their ears and numbed their well-cased limbs.More than
one tiny, wailing babe was frozen at the breast that dull, drab
afternoon, when the sun hung like a ghastly clot of human blood just
above the horizon, and its weird, yellow light flitted through the
snow-laden streets like gaunt spectres of death.More than one aged,
toil-spent laborer, broken at the loom in the service of his
insatiable master, fell prone in the drifts and lay there till his
thin life-current froze and his tired heart stopped.More than one
frenzied, despairing father, forgetful for the moment of the divine
right of property, rushed at a guard and madly strove with him, only
to be clubbed into complaisance, or, perchance, be left in a welter of
crimson on the drifting snow.She had been to see
Pillette that same morning, and had been laughed from his presence.She did not understand, she was told, what miserable creatures these
were that dared ask for bread and human rights.Wait; they themselves
would show their true colors.And it spurted like fountains
from their veins.And they saw it with dimming eyes, and were glad,
for it brought sweet oblivion.That night there were great fires
built along the frozen creek.Shacks and tents were hastily reared;
and the shivering, trembling women and babes given a desperate
shelter.Then the men, sullen and grim, drew off into little groups,
and into the saloons and gambling halls of the town.And when the
blizzard was spent, and the cold stars were dropping their frozen
light, these dull-witted things began to move, slowly at first,
circling about like a great forming nebula, but gaining momentum and
power with each revolution.More than a thousand strong, they circled
out into the frozen streets of the little town, and up along the main
thoroughfare.Their low
curses welled into a roar.And then, like the sudden bursting of
pent-up lava, they swept madly through the town, carrying everything
to destruction before them.Stores, shops, the bank itself, burst open before this wave of
maddened humanity.Guns and pistols were thrown from laden shelves to
the cursing, sweating mob below.Axes and knives were gathered by
armfuls, and borne out into the streets to the whirling mass.Great
barrels of liquor were rolled into the gutters and burst asunder.Bread and meat were dragged from the shops and savagely devoured.The
police gathered and planted themselves with spitting pistols before
the human surge.They went down like grass under stampeded cattle.Frightened clerks and operators rushed to the wires and sent wild,
incoherent appeals for help to New York.Pandemonium had the reins,
the carnal mind was unleashed.On rolled the mob, straight on to the massive stone house of Pillette,
the resident manager of the great Ames mills.On over the high iron
fence, like hungry dock rats.On up the
broad drive, shouting, shooting, moaning, raving.On over the veranda,
and in through broken windows and shattered doors, swarming like flies
over reeking carrion, until the flames which burst through the peaked
roof of the mansion drove them forth, and made them draw sullenly,
protestingly away, leaving the tattered bodies of Pillette and his
wife and daughters to be consumed in the roaring furnace.Oh, ye workers, ye toilers at loom and forge, it is indeed you who
bear the world's burdens!It is you who create the rich man's wealth,
and fight his battles.So ye fought in the great war between North and
South, and protected the rich man at home, hovering in fright over his
money bags.It is you who put into his hands the bayonet which he
turns against you to guard his wealth and maintain his iniquitous
privilege.It is indeed in your hands that the destinies of this great
nation lie; but what will ye do with your marvelous opportunity?What, with your stupendous, untried strength?Will ye once more set up
the golden calf, and prostrate yourselves before it?Will ye again
enthrone ecclesiastical despotism, and grovel before image of Virgin
and Saint?Will ye raise high the powers of mediaeval darkness, and
bend your necks anew to the yoke of ignorance and stagnation?But
think you now that flames and dynamite will break your present bonds?Aye, America may be made a land without a pauper, without a
millionaire, without industrial strife.But fire and sword will not
effect the transformation.Yes, perhaps, as has been said, our
"comfortable social system and its authority will some day be blown to
atoms."But shall we then be better off than we are to-day?For shall
we know then how to use our precious liberty?Blood-drunk and reeling, the mob turned from the flaming wreckage and
flowed down toward the mills.There were some among them, saner, and
prescient of the dire consequences of their awful work, who counseled
restraint.Down into the creek
bottom rolled the seething tide, with a momentum that carried it up
the far side and crashing into the heavily barred oak doors of the
great mills.A crushing hail of bullets fell upon them, and their
leaders went down; but the mass wavered not.Those within the
buildings knew that they would become carrion in the maws of the
ravening wolves outside, and fought with a courage fed with
desperation.In the solemn hush of death Socrates said, "The hour of departure has
arrived, and we go our ways, I to die and you to live.And mankind through the ages in their last
hours have echoed this sentiment of the gentle philosopher.For all
human philosophy leads to a single end--resignation.The frenzied hordes swarming about the Ames mills knew in their heart
of hearts that death was preferable to life in death under the goad of
human exploitation.In the distance, across the swale, the sky glowed red where the souls
of the agent of predatory wealth and his family had gone out in
withering heat.In the stricken town, men huddled their trembling
loved ones about them and stood with loaded muskets.Somewhere on the
steel bands that linked this scene of carnage with the great
metropolis beyond, a train plunged and roared, leaping over the
quivering rails at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, bringing eager
militiamen and their deadly instruments of civilization.For the Ames
mills were private property.*       *       *       *       *

In his luxurious office in the tower of the Ames building the master
sat that black night, surrounded by his laboring cohorts.Though they
strained under the excitement of the hour, Ames himself remained calm
and determined.He was in constant communication with the Governor at
Albany, and with the municipal officers of both New York and Avon.He
had received the tidings of the destruction of the Pillette family
with a grim smile.But the smile had crystallized into an expression
of black, malignant hatred when he demanded of the Governor that the
New York contingent of the state guard be sent at once to protect his
property, and specified that the bullets used should be of the
"dum-dum" variety.Such
bullets had been prohibited by the rules of modern warfare, it was
true.And Ames, foreseeing it all, had
purchased a hundred thousand rounds of these hellish things for the
militia to exchange for those which the Government furnished.And
then, as an additional measure of precaution, he had sent Hood and
Collins into the United States District Court and persuaded the
sitting judge to issue an injunction, enjoining any possible relief
committees from furnishing food and shelter to such as might enter the
industrial conflict being waged against him.And in the blood-red haze that hung
before his glittering eyes was framed the face of the girl who had
spurned him but a few days before.She was the embodiment of love that
had crossed his path and stirred up the very quintessence of evil
within him.From the first she had
aroused within his soul a conflict of emotions such as he had never
known before.And from the night when, in the Hawley-Crowles box at
the opera he had held her hand and looked down into her fathomless
eyes, he had been tortured with the conflicting desires to possess
that fair creature, or to utterly destroy her.Always she hovered just within his
grasp; and then drew back as his itching fingers closed.Always she
told him she loved him--and he knew she lied not.And such love had
its price--but not hers.And so hope strove with wrath, and chagrin
with despair.And
with it she had laid the giant low and bound him with chains.Though he knew now that she was lost to him forever; though
with foul curses he had seen hope flee; yet with it he had also bidden
every tender sentiment, every last vestige of good depart from his
thought forever more.And:

              "----with hope, farewell fear,
              Farewell remorse: all good to me is lost;
              Evil, be thou my good!"And that night the master slept
not, but sat alone at his desk in the great Fifth Avenue mansion, and
plotted the annihilation of every human being who had dared oppose his
worldly ambitions.Plotted, too, the further degradation and final
ruin of the girl who had dared to say she loved him, and yet would not
become his toy.*       *       *       *       *

There is no need to curse the iniquitous industrial and social system
upon which the unstable fabric of our civilization rests, for that
system is its own fell curse in the rotting fruit it bears.A bit of
that poisonous fruit had now dropped from the slimy branch at Avon.Up
from the yards came the militiamen at double-quick, with rifles
unslung and loaded with the satanic Ames bullets.Behind them they
dragged two machine guns, capable of discharging three hundred times a
minute.The mob had concentrated upon the central building of the mill
group, and had just gained entrance through its shattered doors.Before them the guards were falling slowly back, fighting every inch
of the way.The air was thick with powder
smoke.The roar of battle was
deafening.Quickly swinging into action, the militia opened upon the mill hands.Hemmed in between two fires, the mob broke and fled down the frozen
stream.The officers of the guard then ordered their men to join in
the work of extinguishing the flames, which were beginning to make
headway, fanned by the strong draft which swept through the long
building.Then, the building
saved, they pitched their tents and sought a brief rest.At noon the soldiers were again assembled, for there remained the task
of arresting the leaders of the mob and bringing them to justice.The
town had been placed under martial law with the arrival of the
militia.Its streets were patrolled by armed guards, and a strong
cordon had been thrown around the shacks which the mill hands had
hastily erected the afternoon before.And now, under the protection of
a detachment of soldiers, the demand was made for the unconditional
surrender of the striking laborers.Dull terror lay like a pall over the miserable shacks huddled along
the dead stream.It was the dull, hopeless, numbing terror of the
victim who awaits the blow from the lion's paw in the arena.Weeping
wives and mothers, clasping their little ones to them, knelt upon the
frozen ground and crossed themselves.Young men drew their newly-wed
mates to their breasts and kissed them with trembling lips.Stern,
hard-faced men, with great, knotted hands, grouped together and looked
out in deadly hatred at the heartless force surrounding them.Then out from among them and across the ice went Carmen, up the
slippery hillside, and straight to the multi-mouthed machine gun, at
the side of which stood Major Camp.She had been all night with these
bewildered, maddened people.She had warmed shivering babes at her own
breast.She had comforted widows of a night, and newly-bereaved
mothers.She had bound up gaping wounds, and had whispered tender
words of counsel and advice.And they had clung to her weeping; they
had called upon Virgin and Saint to bless her; and they named her the
Angel of Avon--and the name would leave her no more."Take me," she said, "take me into court, and let me tell all."This beautiful, well-clad girl among
such miserable vermin!"You have demanded their leaders," she continued."I have been trying
to lead them.The major's eyes roved over her face and figure.He could make nothing
out of her words, but he motioned to an aid, and bade him place the
girl under arrest.A wild shout then rose from the shacks, as Carmen moved quietly away
under guard.A dozen men sprang out and rushed, muskets in
hand, up toward the soldiers to liberate her.Their narrow vision could
comprehend but one thing at a time; and they saw in the arrest of the
girl only an additional insult piled upon their already mountainous
injuries.It was answered by a shriek of rage from the hovels, and a murderous
return fire.Then the major gave another loud command, and the machine
guns began to vomit forth their clattering message of death.At the sound of shooting, Carmen's guard halted.Then one of them
fell, pierced by a bullet from the strikers.The others released the
girl, and hurried back to the battle line.Carmen stood alone for a
moment.One sang its death-song almost in her ear.Then she turned and made her way slowly up the hill to the
paralyzed town.Down in the vale beneath, Death swung his scythe with long, sweeping
strokes.The two machine guns poured a flaming sheet of lead into the
little camp below.The tents
caught fire, and were whirled blazing aloft by the brisk wind.Men
dropped like chaff from a mill.Hysterical, screaming women rushed
hither and yon to save their young, and were torn to shreds by the
merciless fusillade from above.Babes stood for a moment bewildered,
and then sank with great, gaping wounds in their little, quivering
bodies.And over all brooded the spirit of the great manipulator,
Ames, for the protection of whose sacred rights such ghastly work is
done among civilized men to-day.*       *       *       *       *

That night, while the stars above Avon drew a veil of gray between
them and the earth below, that they might not see the red embers and
stark bodies, Carmen came slowly, and with bent head, into the office
of the Express.As she approached Hitt's door she heard him in earnest
conversation with Haynerd."Yes," the editor was saying, "I had a mortgage placed on the Express
to-day, but I couldn't get much.And it's a short-term one, at that.Stolz refused point blank to help us, unless we would let him dictate
the policy of the paper.He's still
fighting Ames for control of C. and R. And I learn, too, that the
Ketchim case is called for next week.That probably means an attempt
by Ames to smoke Stolz out through Ketchim.It also means that
Carmen--"

"Yes; what about her?""That she will be forced to go upon the stand as a witness.""And that, as I read it, means a further effort on Ames's part to
utterly discredit her in the eyes of the world, and us through her
association with the Express.""But--where is she, Hitt?No word from her since we got the news of
the massacre at Avon this afternoon!Nothing happened to her, do you
think?"Hitt's face was serious, and he did not answer.Then Carmen herself
came through the open door.Both men rose with exclamations of
gladness to welcome her.The girl's eyes were wet, and her wonted
smile had gone.Hitt," she said, "I want a thousand dollars to-night."Hitt and Haynerd both sat down hard."I must go back to Avon to-morrow," she announced."And the money is
for the--the people down there."Her voice caught, and her words
stumbled.The two men looked at each other blankly.Then Hitt reached out and
took her hand."Tell us," he said, "about the trouble there to-day.""No," she said, "we will not talk about evil.A thousand--"

"I have that much on deposit in the bank now, Carmen," he replied
gravely.His thought was on the mortgage which he had signed that
morning."Then write me a check at once, and I will deposit it in the Avon bank
when I get there to-morrow.I must go home now--to see mother.""But--let me think about it, Carmen.Money is--well, won't less than
that amount do you?"Hitt sighed, but made no further protest.If the Express must founder,
then this money were well spent on the stricken people of Avon.He
took out his book, and immediately wrote the check and handed it to
the girl."Hitt," said Haynerd, after Carmen had left them and he had exhausted
his protests over the size of the check, "something's killing that
girl!And it isn't only the trouble at Avon, either!"She's no longer in this world, Ned.But Hitt would say nothing to further illuminate his cryptic remark,
and Haynerd soon switched to the grim topic of the industrial war in
progress at Avon.A
social and industrial system such as ours, which leaves the masses to
starve and consume with disease under intolerable burdens, that a
handful may rot in idleness and luxury, marks us in this latest
century as hopelessly insane!""Well, Ned, whence came the idea, think you, that it is divine justice
for a majority of the people on earth to be poor in order that a few
may be rich?And how are we going to get that perverted idea out of
the minds of men?"Legislation arouses no faith in me!We are
suffering here because, in our immensely selfish thought of ourselves
only, we have permitted the growth of such men as Ames, and allowed
them to monopolize the country's resources.Future
generations will laugh themselves sick over us!Why, what sane excuse
is there for permitting the commonest necessities of life to be
juggled with by gamblers and unmoral men of wealth?How can we ask to
be considered rational when we, with open eyes, allow 'corners' on
foodstuffs, and permit 'wheat kings' to amass millions by corralling
the supply of grain and then raising the price to the point where the
poor washerwoman starves?The
existence of poverty in a country like America is not only proof
positive that our social system is rotten to the core, but that our
religion is equally so!As a people we deserve to be incarcerated in
asylums!""A considerable peroration, Ned," smiled Hitt."And yet, one that I
can not refute.The only hope I see is in a radical change in the
mental attitude of the so-called enlightened class--and yet they are
the very worst offenders!"Doesn't the militia exist for men like Ames?To-day's work at
Avon proves it, I think!""Apparently so, Ned," returned Hitt sadly."And the only possibility
of a change in enlightened people is through a better understanding of
what is really good and worth while."Seems to me, Hitt, that it ought to stagger our preachers to realize
that nineteen centuries of their brand of Christianity have scarcely
even begun to cleanse society.What do you suppose Borwell thinks,
anyway?""Ned, they still cling to human law as necessarily a compelling
influence in the shaping of mankind's moral nature.""And go right on accepting the blood-stained money of criminal
business men who have had the misfortune to amass a million dollars!And, more, they actually hold such men up as patterns for the youth to
emulate!As if the chief end of endeavor were to achieve the glorious
manhood of an Ames!And he a man who is deader than the corpses he
made at Avon to-day!""The world's ideal, my friend, has long been the man who succeeds in
everything except that which is worth while," replied Hitt."But we
have been bidden to come out from the world, and be separate."Y--e--s, of course.But I can't take my thought from Avon--"

"And thereby you emphasize your belief in the reality of evil.""Then, if that is so, why not resign your position, Ned?Not while the Express has a leg to stand on!Your words are
an offense to me, sir!"Hitt rose and clapped his friend heartily on the back.Things do look very dark for us, if we look only with
the human sense of vision.But we are trying to look at the invisible
things within."Ned, Carmen is not in our hands.*       *       *       *       *

On the following afternoon at three a little group of Avon mill hands
crept past the guards and met in Father Danny's Mission, down in the
segregated vice district.They met there because they dared not go
through the town to the Hall.He had
slipped into town the preceding night, and remained in hiding through
the day.She had gone first to the
Hall, and then to the Mission, when she arrived again in the little
town.And after she had deposited Hitt's check in the bank she had
asked Father Danny to call together some of the older and more
intelligent of the mill hands, to discuss methods of disbursing the
money.Almost coincident with her arrival had come an order from Ames to
apprehend the girl as a disturber of the peace.The hush of death lay
over Avon, and even the soldiers now stood aghast at their own bloody
work of the day before.Carmen had avoided the main thoroughfares, and
had made her way unrecognized.At a distance she saw the town jail,
heavily guarded.Its capacity had been sorely taxed, and many of the
prisoners had been crowded into cold, cheerless store rooms, and
placed under guards who stood ready to mow them down at the slightest
threatening gesture.whispered Father Danny, after he had quietly
greeted the girl.It may be the beginning of the great
revolution we've all known wasn't far off!I just _had_ to get back
here!He sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.But soon he
sprang to his feet."No time for mollycoddling!""Come,
men, we'll give you checks, and do you get food for the babies.Only,
don't buy of the company stores!""We'll have to, Father," said one of them."But they've never taken cash from you there, ye know."Aye, Father, and they've discounted that ten per cent each time.But
if we bought at other stores we were discharged."But now then, Miss
Carmen, we'll begin."For an hour the girl wrote small checks, and the priest handed them
out to the eager laborers.They worked feverishly, for they knew that
at any moment they might be apprehended.cried Father Danny, at last unable to restrain himself."Did ye but know that this grand nation is wholly dependent on such as
you, its common people!Not on the rich, I say, the handful that own
its mills and mines, but on you who work them for your rich masters!"Ah, lass, it's but love that I'm dealin' out to 'em, God knows!And
yet, it's they that are masters of the situation, only they don't know
it!They've no leaders, except such as waste their
money and leave 'em in the ditch!The world's social schemes, Miss
Carmen, don't reach such as these.And they've got
the contempt of the wage-earners.""The Church, Father, could do much for these people, if--"

"Don't hesitate, Miss Carmen.You mean, if we didn't give all our
thought to the rich, eh?But still, it's wholly up to the people
themselves, after all.And, mark me, when they do rise, why, such men
as Ames won't know what's hit 'em!"The door was thrown violently open at that moment, and a squad of
soldiers under the command of a lieutenant entered.Carmen and Father Danny rose and faced them.The mill hands stood like
stone images, their faces black with suppressed rage.The lieutenant
halted his men, and then advanced to the girl."Is a woman named Carmen Ariza here?""I am she," replied the fearless girl."Come with us," he said in a rough voice.cried Father Danny, suddenly pulling the girl
back and thrusting himself before her.The mill hands
quickly formed about the girl.And then, with a yell of rage, they
threw themselves upon the soldiers.For a few minutes the little room was a bedlam.The crazed strikers
fought without weapons, except such as they could wrest from the
soldiers.One of them seized Carmen and
threw her beneath the table at which she had been working.The shouting and cursing might have been
heard for blocks around.Father Danny stood in front of the table,
beneath which lay the girl.He strove desperately to maintain his
position, that he might protect her, meantime frantically calling to
the mill hands to drag her out to the rear, and escape by the back
door.In the midst of the _melee_ a soldier mounted a chair near the door
and raised his rifle.The shot roared out, and Father Danny pitched
forward to the floor.Another shot, and still another followed in
quick succession.Then
they turned and fled precipitately through the rear exit.The lieutenant dragged Carmen from beneath the table and out through
the door.Then, assembling his men, he gave an order, and they marched
away with her up the icy street to the town jail.CHAPTER 16


With the wreckage which he had wrought strewn about him, J. Wilton
Ames sat at his rich desk far above the scampering human ants in the
streets below and contemplated the fell work of his own hands.And
often and anon as he looked, great beads of perspiration welled out
upon his forehead, and his breath came hot and dry.In the waste
basket at his feet lay crumpled the newspapers with their shrieking,
red-lettered versions of the slaughter at Avon.He was not a coward,
this man!But he had pushed that basket around the desk out of his
sight, for when he looked at it something rose before him that sent a
chill to his very soul.At times his vision blurred; and then he
passed his hands heavily across his eyes.He had chanced to read in
the grewsome accounts of the Avon massacre that little children had
been found among those fallen shacks, writhing in their last agonies.And the reports had said that great, red-dripping holes had been
ripped in their thin little bodies by those awful "dum-dum" bullets.And why had the demoniac soldiers down
there blown the brains from harmless women and helpless babes?He
really had not intended to go so far!The brats would have grown up to oppose
the vested privileges of the rich!They, too, would have become
anarchists and rioters, bent on leveling the huge industrial fabric
which such as he had so laboriously erected under the legal protection
afforded their sacred rights!And
the great captains of industry would thank him for the example he had
thus fearlessly set!To think of Avon was for him now to think in terms of blood.And yet
his carnal soul hourly wrestled sore with thoughts of a wholly
different stamp; with those strange emotions which he had felt when in
Carmen's presence; with those unfamiliar sentiments which, had he not
fought them back so bitterly, might have made him anew, and--

But the remembrance maddened him.His face grew black, and his mouth
poured forth a torrent of foul imprecations and threats upon her and
upon those who stood with her.He smote the
desk with his great fist.He fumed, he frothed, he hurled reason from
its throne, and bade the Furies again become his counselors.Upon the desk before him lay the mortgage papers which Hitt had
signed.He had bought the mortgage from the bank which had loaned the
Express the money.He would crush that sheet now, crush it until the
ink dripped black from its emasculated pages!And when it fell into
his hands, he would turn it into the yellowest of sensational
journals, and hoot the memory of its present staff from ocean to
ocean!Then, his head sunk upon his breast, he fell to wondering if he might
not secure a mortgage upon the Beaubien cottage, and turn its
occupants into the street.It was the
lever by which he moved the world, and clubbed its dull-witted
inhabitants into servile obeisance!Who could stand against him--

That girl!That obedient lackey hastened
into his master's presence."Called for this week, sir," replied Hood, glad that the announcement
could not possibly offend his superior."Brought up from Avon, and lodged in the Tombs, sir.""You tell Judge Spencer that if he allows her bail I'll see that his
federal appointment is killed, understand?"Ames regarded the man with a mixture of admiration and utter contempt.For Hood stood before him a resplendent example of the influence of
the most subtle of all poisons, the insidious lure of money.Soul and
body he had prostituted himself and his undoubted talents to it.And
now, were he to be turned adrift by Ames, the man must inevitably sink
into oblivion, squeezed dry of every element of genuine manhood, and
weighted with the unclean lucre for which his bony fingers had always
itched.He knows most about the formation of the defunct
Simiti company.""Well, see him and--you say he's young, and got a wife and baby?Offer
him twenty-five thousand to quit the case.""I'm afraid it wouldn't do, sir," returned Hood, shaking his head
dubiously."I've had men talking with him regarding the trial, and
he--"

"Then get him over here.I'll see if I can't persuade him," growled
Ames in an ugly tone.A few minutes later Reverend Darius Borwell
was ushered into the financier's private office.Ames," cried that gentleman of the cloth, "it's shocking,
terribly so, what those unbridled, unprincipled mill hands have drawn
upon themselves down in Avon!And four members of the Church
of the Social Revolution came to my study last evening and demanded
that I let them speak to my congregation on the coming Sabbath!"And I shall
have policemen stationed at the doors next Sunday to maintain order!To think that it has come to this in America!I would advise--"

"Nobody can get within a block of my house, sir, without ringing a
series of electric bells," replied Ames evenly."I have fifty guards
and private detectives in attendance in and about my premises all the
time.My limousine has been lined with sheet steel.I simply want to keep going
until I can carry out a few plans I have in hand."His thought had
reverted again to the fair girl in the Tombs."But now, Borwell," he continued, "I want to talk with you about
another matter.I am drawing up my will, and--"

"Why, my dear Mr.Ames thought of his physician's constantly iterated warning; but shook
his head."I may get caught in this Avon affair," he said evasively.The President has sent his message to
Congress, as you may be aware.There are unpleasant suggestions in it
regarding dispossession in cases like my own.I'm coming back by
magnanimously willing to Congress a hundred millions, to stand as a
fund for social uplift.""But the little matter I wish to discuss with you is the sum that I am
setting aside for the erection of a new church edifice," continued
Ames, eying the minister narrowly.cried that worthy gentleman, springing up and
clasping the financier's hand.One should not be too precipitate in
accepting tentative benefactions."Ah--we really should have--ah--a
trifle more, Mr.There's the settlement home, and the commons,
you know, and--"

"Humph!Well, we'll start with half a million," replied Ames dryly."By the way, you know Jurges, eh?Er--have
you any particular influence with him, if I may ask?"His sharp eyes
bored straight through the wondering divine."Why--yes--yes, I know the gentleman.And, as for influence--well, I
may--"

"Yes, just so," put in Ames."Now there is a trial coming up this
week, and Jurges will be called to the stand.I want you to give him
the true facts in regard to it.I'll call Hood, and we'll go over them
in detail now.Then you see Jurges this afternoon, and--say, he's
raising a building fund too, isn't he?"The magnate summoned Hood again; and for an hour the trio discussed
the forthcoming trial of the unfortunate Philip O. Ketchim.Then Ames
dismissed the clergyman, and bade his office boy admit the young
lawyer, Cass, who had come in response to Hood's request.For some moments after Cass entered the office Ames stood regarding
him, studying what manner of man he was, and how best to approach him.Then he opened the conversation by a casual reference to the
unsatisfactory business situation which obtained throughout the
country, and expressed wonder that young men just starting in their
professions managed to make ends meet."But," he concluded with deep significance, "better go hungry than
take on any class of business which, though promising good money
returns, nevertheless might eventually prove suicidal."He looked hard
at the young lawyer when he paused."But as I am
particularly busy this morning, may I ask why you have sent for me?Have you anything that I can--"

"I have," abruptly interrupted the financier."We need additions to
our legal staff.I thought perhaps you might like to talk over the
matter with me, with a view to entering our employ."Ames, I--I have never thought of--" The young man's eyes
glistened."Well, suppose you think of it now," said Ames, smiling graciously."I
have heard considerable about you of late, and I must say I rather
like the way you have been handling your work."The work which he had been
doing of late was most ordinary and routine, and called for no display
of legal skill whatever."I'd hate to see you tackle anything at this stage of your career, Mr.And I am afraid your
association with Ketchim is going to do just that.But possibly you do
not intend to handle further business for him?"Ketchim, though long confined in the Tombs, had at length secured
bail, through the not wholly disinterested efforts of his uncle,
Stolz, the sworn enemy of Ames.And, because of his loyal efforts in
behalf of Ketchim, Stolz had insisted that Cass be retained as counsel
for the latter when his trial should come up."I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr.Hood
will take you on at a salary of, say, five thousand to start with.We'll try you out for a few weeks.Then, if we don't mutually fit,
why, we'll quietly separate and say nothing.Half of that salary would have looked large to him
then.But--

"May I ask," he slowly said in reply, "what class of work Mr.Hood
would give me to start with?""Why, nothing of great importance, perhaps, while you are getting into
the harness.You've had experience
in that, eh?"That little house
which he had passed and stopped to look at so wistfully every night on
his way home was now within his grasp.He glanced up at the great man, sitting so calmly before him.Ames," he said, "if I enter your employ, it must be with the
stipulation that I shall have nothing to do with the Ketchim trial.""If you enter my employ, sir, it will
be with the stipulation that you do as I say," he returned coldly.And then the young lawyer saw through the mask.And his anger flamed
high at what he discerned behind it.Ames," said he, "you have made a mistake.I am poor, and I need
business.But I have not as yet fallen so completely under the spell
of fortune-hunting as to sell my honor to a man like you!To enter
your employ, I now see, would mean the total loss of character and
self respect.It would mean a lowering of my ideals, whatever they may
be, to your own vulgar standard.I may have done wrong in becoming
associated with Mr.But I
pledged myself to assist him.And yet, in doing so, I scarcely can
blacken my reputation to the extent that I should were I to become
your legal henchman.But there are some terms upon
which even I can not accept it.Ames gave a snort of anger when Cass went out.Summoning Hood, he
vented his great wrath upon that individual's bald pate."And now," he
concluded, "I want that fellow Cass so wound up that he will sneak off
to a lonely spot and commit suicide!And if you can't do it, then I'll
accept your resignation!"Ames, I have
just learned that Judge Harris, father of the young man who came up
with that girl, is in Colombia.Seems that he's taken some wealthy man
down there to look at La Libertad mine.""They believe you put one over on Ketchim, with the help of Monsignor
Lafelle, and so they've gone down to get titles to that mine.""By G--"

"And they say that--"

"Never mind what they say!""Cable Wenceslas at once to
see that those fellows remain permanently in Colombia.He has ways of
accomplishing that.I guess
Wenceslas can block his little game!"His great frame shook slightly as he stood consuming with rage, and a
slight hemorrhage started from his nostrils.And as he walked, Hood thought his left foot dragged
slightly.*       *       *       *       *

And then, with the way well cleared, came the Ketchim trial, which has
gone down in history as containing the most spectacular _denouement_
in the record of legal procedure in the New World.Had it been
concerned, as was anticipated, only with routine legal procedure
against the man Ketchim, a weak-souled compound of feeble sycophancy
and low morals, it would have attracted slight attention, and would
have been spread upon the court records by uninterested clerks with
never a second thought.But there were elements entering into it of
whose existence the outside world could not have even dreamed.Into it
converged threads which now may be traced back to scenes and events in
three continents; threads whose intricate windings led through
trackless forest and dim-lit church; through court of fashion and hut
of poverty; back through the dark mazes of mortal thought, where no
light shines upon the carnal aims and aspirations of the human mind;
back even to the doors of a palace itself, even to the proudest throne
of the Old World.But none of these elements found expression in the indictment against
the frightened defendant, the small-visioned man who had sought to
imitate the mighty Ames, and yet who lacked sufficient intelligence of
that sort which manifests in such a perversion of skill and power.Ames was a tremendous corruptionist, who stood beyond the laws simply
because of the elemental fact that he himself made those laws.Ketchim
was a plain deceiver.Mingling
his theology with fraud, he employed the unholy alliance for the
purpose of exploiting the credulous who attended his prayer meetings
and commented with bated breath upon his beautiful showing of
religious zeal.He was but one of a multitude afflicted with the
"dollar mania."His misfortune was that his methods were so antique
that they could not long fail of detection.And it was because of his
use of the mails for the purpose of deceit that the indictment had
been drawn against Philip O. Ketchim _et al._ by the long-suffering,
tolerant complainant, called the people.Nominally the people's interests were in the hands of the Public
Prosecutor, a certain smug young worldling named Ellis.But, as that
gentleman owed his appointment to Ames, it is not surprising that at
his right hand sat Hood and his well trained staff.Nominally, too,
Judge Spencer conducted the trial strictly upon its merits, not all of
which lay with the people.But the judge might have been still
prosecuting petty cases back in the unknown little district from
which he came, had it not been for the great influence of Ames, long
since, who had found him on a certain occasion useful.And so the jury
panel contained none but those who, we may be very sure, were amenable
to the tender pressure of a soft hand lined with yellow gold.And only
those points of evidence were sustained which conduced to the
incrimination of the miserable defendant.Ketchim was doomed before
the trial began.And yet, to subserve the dark schemes of Ames, and to lengthen the
period of torture to which his victims should be subjected, the trial
was dragged through many days.Besides, even he and his hirelings were
bound to observe the formalities.It was at the suggestion of Cass that no effort had been made to
procure bail for Carmen after her arrest.The dramatic may always be
relied upon to carry a point which even plain evidence negatives.And
she, acquiescing in the suggestion, remained a full two weeks in the
Tombs before Ames's eager counsel found their opportunity to confront
her on the witness stand and besmirch her with their black charges.The Beaubien was prostrated.But, knowing that for her another hour of
humiliation and sorrow had come, she strove mightily to summon her
strength for its advent.Father Waite toiled with Cass day and night.Hitt and Haynerd, without financial resources, pursued their way, grim
and silent.And
they stood at the helm, stanch to their principles, not yielding an
iota to offers of assistance in exchange for a reversal of the policy
upon which the paper had been launched."We're going down, Hitt," said Haynerd grimly."But we go with the
flag flying at the mast!"He was learning to know as did Carmen, and to
see with eyes which were invisible.It was just when the jury had been impaneled, after long days of petty
wrangling and childish recrimination among the opposing lawyers, that
Stolz came to Ames and laid down his sword.The control of C. and R.
should pass unequivocally to the latter if he would but save Ketchim
from prison.Then Ames lay back and roared with laughter over his great triumph.He would send Stolz' nephew to prison, and then roll a
bomb along Wall Street whose detonation would startle the financial
world clean out of its orbit!Stolz had failed to notice that Ames's
schemes had so signally worked out that C. and R. was practically in
his hands now!The defeated railroad magnate at length backed out of
the Ames office purple with rage.And then he pledged himself to
hypothecate his entire fortune to the rescue of his worthless nephew.Thus, in deep iniquity, was launched the famous trial, a process of
justice in name only, serving as an outlet for a single man's long
nurtured personal animosities.The adulterous union of religion and
business was only nominally before the bar.The victims, not the
defendant only, not the preachers, the washerwomen, the factory girls,
the widows, and the orphans, whose life savings Ketchim had drawn into
his net by the lure of pious benedictions, but rather those
unfortunates who had chanced to incur the malicious hatred of the
great, legalized malefactor, Ames, by opposition to his selfish
caprice, and whose utter defeat and discrediting before the public
would now place the crown of righteous expediency upon his own
chicanery and extortion and his wantonly murderous deeds.Doctor Jurges, utterly
confused by the keen lawyers, and vainly endeavoring to follow the
dictates of his conscience, while attempting to reconcile them with
his many talks with Darius Borwell, gave testimony which fell little
short of incriminating himself.For there were produced letters which
he had written to members of his congregation, and which for subtlety
and deception, though doubtless innocently done, would have made a
seasoned promoter look sharp to his own laurels.He had been summoned from Denver for the
trial.But his stuttering evidence gave no advantage to either side.And then--crowning blunder!--Cass permitted Ketchim himself to take
the stand.And the frightened, trembling broker gave his own cause
such a blow that the prosecution might well have asked the judge to
take the case from the jury then and there.It was a legal _faux pas_;
and Cass walked the floor and moaned the whole night through.Then, as per program, the prosecution called Madam Beaubien.Could not
that sorrowing woman have given testimony which would have aided the
tottering defense, and unmasked the evil genius which presided over
this mock trial?But not one point would the
judge sustain when it bordered upon forbidden territory.It was made
plain to her that she was there to testify against Ketchim, and to
permit the Ames lawyers to bandy her own name about the court room
upon the sharp points of their cruel cross-questions and low
insinuations.But, she protested, her knowledge of the Simiti company's affairs had
come through another person.Ames should give his own testimony--for was it not he who
had, not long since, legally punished the witness on a charge of
defamation of character?And the spectators
knew that it was because the righteous prosecution could no longer
stain its hands with one who bore such a tarnished name as she.And then, taunted and goaded to exasperation, the wronged woman burst
into tears and flayed the bigamist Ames there before the court room
crowded with eager society ladies and curious, non-toiling men.Flayed
him as men are seldom flayed and excoriated by the women they trample.The bailiffs seized her, and dragged her into an ante-room; the judge
broke his gavel rapping for order, and threatened to clear the court;
and then Cass, too young and inexperienced to avoid battle with
seasoned warriors, rose and demanded that Madam Beaubien be returned
to the stand.He turned to
the people, as if seeking their support.A great murmur arose through
the court room.That man, sitting calm
and unimpassioned, nodded his head slightly.And the woman was led
back to the chair."It may have an important bearing upon the case, Your Honor!"cried
the young lawyer for the defense.Ames is to take the stand as an
important witness in this case.If Madam Beaubien brings such a charge
against him, it gives us reason to believe his honor peccable, and his
testimony open to suspicion!"It was a daring statement, and the whole room gasped, and held its
breath."The
lawyer for the defense is in contempt of court!Madam Beaubien has
been shown to be a--"

"The objection is sustained!"_"His first wife's portrait--is in a glass window--in his yacht!"_
cried the hysterical Beaubien.Then she crumpled up in a limp mass,
and was led from the chair half fainting.At the woman's shrill words a white-haired man, dressed in black,
clerical garb, who had been sitting in the rear of the room close to
the door, rose hastily, then slowly sat down again.At his feet
reposed a satchel, bearing several foreign labels.Evidently he had
but just arrived from distant lands.Consternation reigned throughout the room for a few minutes.Then
Cass, believing that the psychological moment had arrived, loudly
called Carmen Ariza to the stand.The dramatic play must be continued,
now that it had begun.The battle which had raged back and forth for
long, weary days, could be won, if at all, only by playing upon the
emotions of the jury, for the evidence thus far given had resulted in
showing not only the defense, but likewise the Beaubien, and all who
had been associated with the Simiti company, including Cass himself,
to be participators in gross, intentional fraud.The remaining witness, the girl herself, had been purposely neglected
by the prosecution, for the great Ames had planned that she must be
called by the defense.Then would he bring up the prostitute, Jude,
and from her wring testimony which must blast forever the girl's
already soiled name.Following her, he would himself take the stand,
and tell of the girl's visits to his office; of her protestations of
love for him; of her embracing him; and of a thousand indiscretions
which he had carefully garnered and stored for this triumphant
occasion.But the judge, visibly perturbed by the dramatic turn which the case
seemed to be taking, studied his watch for a moment, then Ames's face,
and then abruptly adjourned court until the following day.Yet not
until Cass had been recognized, and the hounded girl summoned from her
cell in the Tombs, to take the stand in the morning for--her life!CHAPTER 17


In the days to come, when the divine leaven which is in the world
to-day shall have brought more of the carnal mind's iniquity to the
surface, that the Sun of Truth may destroy the foul germs, there shall
be old men and women, and they which, looking up from their work, peep
and mutter of strange things long gone, who shall fall wonderingly
silent when they have told again of the fair young girl who walked
alone into the crowded court room that cold winter's morning.And
their stories will vary with the telling, for no two might agree what
manner of being it was that came into their midst that day.Even the bailiffs, as if moved by some strange prescience, had fallen
back and allowed her to enter alone.The buzz of subdued chatter
ceased, and a great silence came over all as they looked.Some swore,
in awed whispers, when the dramatic day had ended, and judge and jury
and wrangling lawyer had silently, and with bowed heads, gone quiet
and thoughtful each to his home, that a nimbus encircled her beautiful
head when she came through the door and faced the gaping multitude.Some said that her eyes were raised; that she saw not earthly things;
and that a heavenly presence moved beside her.Nor may we lightly set
aside these tales; for, after the curtain had fallen upon the
wonderful scene about to be enacted, there was not one present who
would deny that, as the girl came into the great room and went
directly to the witness chair, God himself walked at her side and held
her hand."Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou
dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou
goest."Through the mind of that same white-haired man in the clerical garb
ran these words as he watched the girl move silently across the room.She seemed to have taken on a new meaning to him since the previous
day.And as he looked, his eyes grew moist, and he drew out his
handkerchief.But his were not the only eyes that had filled then.Hitt and Haynerd
bent their heads, that the people might not see; Miss Wall and the
Beaubien wept silently, and with no attempt to stay their grief; Jude
buried her head in her hands, and rocked back and forth, moaning
softly.A welter of conflicting emotions
surged through their harassed souls.They seemed to have come now to
the great crisis.And which way the tide would turn rested with this
lone girl.For some moments after she was seated the silence remained unbroken.And as she sat there, waiting, she looked down at the man who sought
to destroy what he might not possess.Some said afterward that as she
looked at him she smiled.Who knows but that the Christ himself smiled
down from the cross at those who had riven his great heart?He was far
from well that morning, and an ugly, murderous mood possessed him.And
yet, judged by the world's standards, he had tipped the crest of
success.He was swollen
with wealth, with material power, with abnormal pride.His tender
sensibilities and sympathies were happily completely ossified, and he
was stone deaf and blind to the agonies of a suffering world.Not a
single aim but had been realized; not a lone ambition but had been
met.Even the armed camp at Avon, and the little wooden crosses over
the fresh mounds there, all testified to his omnipotence; and in them,
despite their horrors, he felt a satisfying sense of his own great
might.The clerk held up the Bible for the girl to give her oath.She looked
at him for a moment, and then smiled."I will tell the truth," she
said simply.The officer hesitated, and looked up at the judge.But the latter sat
with his eyes fixed upon the girl.The clerk did not press the point;
and Carmen was delivered into the hands of the lawyers.Then, yielding to a sudden
impulse, he asked the girl to mention briefly the place of her birth,
her parentage, and other statistical data, leading up to her
association with the defendant.It was but the one she had
told again and again.And when
she had concluded, Cass turned her back again to Simiti, and to
Rosendo's share in the mining project which had ultimated in this
suit.A far-away look came into the girl's eyes as she spoke of that great,
black man who had taken her from desolate Badillo into his own warm
heart.There were few dry eyes among the spectators when she told of
his selfless love.And when she drew the portrait of him, standing
alone in the cold mountain water, far up in the jungle of Guamoco,
bending over the laden _batea_, and toiling day by day in those
ghastly solitudes, that she might be protected and educated and raised
above her primitive environment in Simiti, there were sobs heard
throughout the room; and even the judge, hardened though he was by
conflict with the human mind, removed his glasses and loudly cleared
his throat as he wiped them.Ames first grew weary as he listened, and then exasperated.His lawyer
at length rose to object to the recital on the ground that it was
largely irrelevant to the case.And the judge, pulling himself
together, sustained the objection.Then the prosecution
eagerly took up the cross-examination."Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
bring forth," murmured the white-haired man in the clerical garb far
back in the crowded room.Had he learned the law of Truth to error,
"Thou shall surely die"?Did he discern the vultures gnawing at the
rich man's vitals?Did he, too, know that this giant of privilege, so
insolently flaunting his fleeting power, his blood-stained wealth and
his mortal pride, might as well seek to dim the sun in heaven as to
escape the working of those infinite divine laws which shall effect
the destruction of evil and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven
even here upon earth?The latter drew Ellis down and
transmitted his master's instructions.The atmosphere grew tense, and
the hush of expectancy lay over all."Miss Carmen," began Ellis easily, "your parentage has been a matter
of some dispute, if I mistake not, and--"

Cass was on his feet to object.What had this question to do with the
issue?Cass should have divined it by this time.Ellis cleared his throat and adjusted his glasses."And your
father, it is said, was a <DW64> priest.I believe that has been
accepted for some time."I never knew my earthly father," replied Carmen in a low voice."But you have admitted that it might have been this Diego, have you
not?""It might have been," returned the girl, looking off absently toward
the high windows."Did he not claim you as his daughter?""Now," continued Ellis, "that being reasonably settled, is it not also
true that you used the claim of possessing this mine, La Libertad, as
a pretext for admission to society here in New York?"The girl did not answer, but only smiled pityingly at him.He, too,
had bartered his soul; and in her heart there rose a great sympathy
for him in his awful mesmerism."And that you claimed to be an Inca princess?"admonished the judge, looking severely down upon the silent
girl.Carmen sighed, and drew her gaze away from the windows.She was weary,
oh, so weary of this unspeakable mockery.And yet she was there to
prove her God."I would like to ask this further question," Ellis resumed, without
waiting for her reply."Were you not at one time in a resort conducted
by Madam Cazeau, down on--"

He stopped short.The girl's eyes were looking straight into his, and
they seemed to have pierced his soul."I am sorry for you," she said
gently, "oh, so sorry!The man knew not whether to smile in triumph or hide his head in
shame.Ames alone
met his embarrassed glance, and sent back a command to continue the
attack.What possible relation to the
issue involved could such testimony have?But the judge bade him sit
down, as the counsel for the prosecution doubtless was bringing out
facts of greatest importance.Ellis again cleared his throat and bent to his loathsome task."Now,
Miss Ariza, in reference to your labors to incite the mill hands at
Avon to deeds of violence, the public considers that as part of a
consistent line of attack upon Mr.Ames, in which you were aiding
others from whom you took your orders.May I ask you to cite the
motives upon which you acted?"Ames," she slowly replied, "but only the
things he stands for."A militant brand of social uplift, I
suppose?"And that is the sort of remedy that anarchists apply to
industrial troubles, is it not?""There is no remedy for industrial troubles but Christianity," she
said gently."Not the burlesque Christianity of our countless sects
and churches; not Roman Catholicism; not Protestantism; nor any of the
fads and fancies of the human mind; but just the Christianity of Jesus
of Nazareth, who knew that the human man was not God's image, but only
stood for it in the mortal consciousness.And he always saw behind
this counterfeit the real man, the true likeness of God.And--"

"You are diverging from the subject proper and consuming time, Miss
Ariza!"Carmen did not heed him, but continued quietly:

"And it was just such a man that Jesus portrayed in his daily walk and
words.""No," the girl went calmly on, "Jesus did not stand for the
intolerance, the ignorance, the bigotry, the hatred, and the human
hypothesis, the fraud, and chicanery, and the 'Who shall be greatest?'Nor did he make evil a reality, as mortals do.He knew it seemed awfully real to the deceived human consciousness;
but he told that consciousness to be not afraid.And then he went to
work and drove out the belief of evil on the basis of its nothingness
and its total lack of principle.The orthodox churches and sects of
to-day do not do that.Their
kingdom is wholly temporal, and is upheld by heartless millionaires,
and by warlike kings and emperors.Their tenets shame the intelligence
of thinking men!Yet they have slain tens of millions to establish
them!"To remove the girl meant depriving Ames of
his prey.But if she remained upon the stand, she would put them all
to confusion, for they had no means of silencing her.The judge looked
blankly at Ames; his hands were tied.Ellis hurried to change the current of her talk by interposing another
question."Will you tell us, Miss Carmen, why you have been working--"

"I have been working for God," she interrupted.Her voice was low and
steady, and her eyes shone with a light that men are not wont to see
in those of their neighbors.And for Him I am here to-day."Consternation was plainly discernible in the camp of the prosecution.Cass knew now that he need make no more objections.The defense had
passed from his hands.At this juncture James Ketchim, brother of the defendant, thinking to
relieve the strain and embarrassment, gave audible voice to one of his
wonted witticisms.But the effect was not
what he had anticipated.roared the exasperated judge, bending
far over his desk.And the elder
Ketchim retired in chagrin and confusion."Miss Carmen," pursued Ellis, eager to recover his advantage, for he
saw significant movements among the jury, "do you not think the
unfortunate results at Avon quite prove that you have allied yourself
with those who oppose the nation's industrial progress?"Order had now been restored in the court room, and
Ellis was feeling sure of himself again."You have opposed the constructive development of our country's
resources by your assaults upon men of wealth, like Mr.Ames, for
example, have you not?"Then the girl opened her mouth, and from it came words that fell upon
the room like masses of lead."I stand opposed to any man, Mr.Ellis,
who, to enrich himself, and for the purpose of revenge, spreads the
boll weevil in the cotton fields of the South."And yet it was a silence that
fell crashing upon Ames's straining ears.He sat for a moment stunned;
then sprang to his feet.He held out a
hand, and made as if to speak; then sank again into his chair.Ellis collected himself, and turned to the judge."Your Honor, we regret to state that, from the replies which Miss
Ariza has given, we do not consider her mentally competent as a
witness."I should
like to examine the witness further!"returned the judge, glowering over his spectacles
at the young lawyer."I stand on--"

"Sit down!"called Cass through the rising tumult, "the lawyer for
the prosecution has heaped insults upon you in his low references to
your parentage.Will you--"

The judge pounded upon his desk with the remnant of his broken gavel.he called in a loud, threatening
voice.The judge sat down and mopped his steaming face.Ames was a study of
wild, infuriated passion.Carmen
sat quietly facing the crowded room.She had reached up and was
fondling the little locket which hung at her throat.It was the first
time she had ever worn it.It was not a pretty piece of jewelry; and
it had never occurred to her to wear it until that day.Nor would she
have thought of it then, had not the Beaubien brought it to the Tombs
the night before in a little box with some papers which the girl had
called for.Why she had put it on, she could not say.Slowly, while the silence continued unbroken, the girl drew the
slender chain around in front of her and unclasped it."I--I never--knew my parents," she murmured musingly, looking down
lovingly at the little locket.Then she opened it and sat gazing, rapt
and absorbed, at the two little portraits within."But there are their
pictures," she suddenly announced, holding the locket out to Cass.It was said afterward that never in the history of legal procedure in
New York had that court room held such dead silence as when Cass stood
bending over the faces of the girl's earthly parents, portrayed in the
strange little locket which Rosendo had taken from Badillo years
before.Never had it known such a tense moment; never had the very air
itself seemed so filled with a mighty, unseen presence, as on that day
and in that crisal hour.Without speaking, Hood rose and looked over Cass's shoulder at the
locket.A muffled cry escaped him, and he turned and stared at Ames."Yes, sir," replied Hood in a voice that was scarcely heard.Hood seemed to have frozen to the spot.His hands shook, and his words
gibbered from his trembling lips."The--the woman's portrait, sir--is--is--the one in--in Mr."_

The piercing cry rang through the still room like a lost soul's
despairing wail.Ames had rushed from his seat, overturning his chair,
thrusting the lawyers aside, and seized the locket.For a moment he
peered wildly into it.It seemed as if his eyes would devour it,
absorb it, push themselves clean through it, in their eagerness to
grasp its meaning.His eyes were red; his face ashen; his lips white.His unsteady glance met the girl's.His mouth opened, and flapped like
a broken shutter in the wind.His arms swung wildly upward; then
dropped heavily.Suddenly he bent to one side; caught himself;
straightened up; and then, with a horrifying, gurgling moan, crashed
to the floor.The noise of the tremendous fall reverberated through
the great room like an echo of Satan's plunge into the pit of hell.They rushed forward in a mass, over railings, over chairs
and tables, heedless of all but the great mystery that was slowly
clearing away in the dim light that winter's morning.Through them the
white-haired man, clad in clerical vestments, elbowed his way to the
bar.He tore it from Hood's hand and scanned it eagerly.he murmured, trembling with
excitement.Then, shouting to the judge above the hubbub:

"Your Honor!called the judge in a loud, quavering voice.The woman's
portrait in this little locket is that of Dona Dolores, Infanta,
daughter of Queen Isabella the Second, of Spain!And this girl,"
pointing to the bewildered Carmen, who sat clinging to the arms of her
chair, "is her child, and is a princess of the royal blood!Her father
is the man who lies there--J. Wilton Ames!"CHAPTER 18


Borne on pulsing electric waves, the news of the great _denouement_
flashed over the city, and across a startled continent.Beneath the
seas it sped, and into court and hovel.Madrid gasped; Seville panted;
and old Padre Rafael de Rincon raised his hoary head and cackled
shrilly.To the seething court room came flying reporters and news gatherers,
who threw themselves despairingly against the closed portals.Within,
the bailiffs fought with the excited crowd, and held the doors against
the panic without.Over the prostrate form of Ames the physicians worked with feverish
energy, but shook their heads.In the adjoining ante-room, whither she had been half carried, half
dragged by Hitt when Ames fell, sat Carmen, clasped in the Beaubien's
arms, stunned, bewildered, and speechless.Hitt stood guard at the
door; and Miss Wall and Jude tiptoed about with bated breath, unable
to take their eyes from the girl.In the court room without, Haynerd held the little locket, and plied
Monsignor Lafelle with his incoherent questions.The excited editor's
brain was afire; but of one thing he was well assured, the Express
would bring out an extra that night that would scoop its rivals clean
to the bone!In a few minutes the bailiffs fought the mob back from the doors and
admitted a man, a photographer, who had been sent out to procure
chemicals in the hope that the portrait of the man in the locket might
be cleaned.Ten minutes later the features of J. Wilton Ames stood
forth clearly beside those of the wife of his youth.The picture
showed him younger in appearance, to be sure, but the likeness was
unmistakable.Monsignor, but you are slow!wailed Haynerd, shaking the
churchman's arm in his excitement."I saw the portrait in the Royal
Gallery, years ago, in Madrid.I could not forget the
sad, sweet face.I saw it again in the stained-glass window in the
Ames yacht.There was much whispering, much shaking of heads, but little
information.But this I know: the queen, the great Isabella, had a
lover, a wonderful tenor, Marfori, Marquis de Loja.And one day a babe
was taken quietly to a little cottage in the Granada hills.Rumor said
that it was an Infanta, and that the tenor was its father.One man, perhaps: old Rafael de Rincon.But Rome suddenly recalled
him from Isabella's court, and after that he was very quiet."Ames," he said, "traveled much in
Europe.He bought a vineyard in Granada--the
one from which he still procures his wine.And there--who knows?--he
met the Infanta.But probably neither he nor she guessed her royal
birth.""Well, they eloped--who knows?Whether married or not, I can not say.But it is evident she went with him to Colombia, where, perhaps, he
was seeking a concession from Congress in Bogota.Then came the news of his father's sudden death.Possibly he bade her wait for his return.But a
prospective mother is often excitable.She waited a day, a week--who
knows how long?she was wild
to do such a thing.She died at the little
riverine town of Badillo, after her babe, Carmen, was born."A heritage from her grandfather, the tenor, Marfori," Lafelle
suggested."But--the portraits--what is the name under that of Ames?"Yes, for Guillermo in Spanish is William.Doubtless Ames told her his
name was Will, contracted from Wilton, the name he went by in his
youth.And the nearest the Spanish could come to it was Guillermo.Diego's name was Guillermo Diego Polo.And after he had seen that name
in the locket he used it as a further means of strengthening his claim
upon the girl.""Then--she is--a--princess!""Yes, doubtless, if my reasoning is correct.Not an Inca princess, but
a princess of the reigning house of Spain."Haynerd could hold himself no longer, but rushed madly from the room
and tore across town to the office of the Express.Then came the white-enameled ambulance, dashing and careening to the
doors of the building where Ames lay so quiet.Gently, silently, the
great body was lifted and borne below.And then the chattering,
gesticulating mob poured from the court room, from the halls and
corridors, and out into the chill sunlight of the streets, where they
formed anew into little groups, and went over again the dramatic
events but a few minutes past.Then, too, emerged Carmen, heavily veiled from the curious, vulgar
gaze of the rabble, and entered the waiting limousine, with the
Beaubien and Hitt.Miss Wall and the gasping Jude followed in another.The judge had bidden the girl go on her own recognizance.The arrest
at Avon; the matter of bail; all had merged into the excitement of the
hour and been forgotten.Ketchim went out on Cass's arm.The judge had
ordered the clerk to enter an adjournment.*       *       *       *       *

All that afternoon and far into the night a gaping, wondering
concourse braved the cold and stood about the walk that led up to the
little Beaubien cottage.Within, the curtains were drawn, and Sidney,
Jude, and Miss Wall answered the calls that came incessantly over the
telephone and to the doors.Sidney had not been in the court room, for
Haynerd had left him at the editor's desk in his own absence.But with
the return of Haynerd the lad had hurried into a taxicab and commanded
the chauffeur to drive madly to the Beaubien home.And once through
the door, he clasped the beautiful girl in his arms and strained her
to his breast."My own, my very own little sister!We only
pretended before, didn't we?But now--now, oh, God above!The scarce comprehending girl drew his head down and kissed him."Sidney," she murmured, "the ways of God are past finding out!"Aye, for again, as of old, He had chosen the foolish things of the
world to confound the wise; He had chosen the weak to confound the
mighty; and the base things, and the things despised, had He used to
bring to naught the things that are.That no flesh might
glory in His terrible presence!The girl smiled up at him; then turned away.she kept repeating, groping her way about
the room as if in a haze.The still dazed Beaubien drew the girl into her arms.Yet I
called you that from the very first.And he--that
man--your father!"It--"

Then the Beaubien's heart almost stopped.What,
then, would this sudden turn in the girl's life mean to the lone woman
who clung to her so?"No, mother dearest," whispered Carmen, looking up through her tears."For even if it should be true, I will not leave you.He--he--"

She stopped; and would speak of him no more.But neither of them knew as yet that in that marvelous Fifth Avenue
palace, behind those drawn curtains and guarded bronze doors, at which
an eager crowd stood staring, Ames, the superman, lay dying, his left
side, from the shoulder down, paralyzed.*       *       *       *       *

In the holy quiet of the first hours of morning, the mist rose, and
the fallen man roused slowly out of his deep stupor.And then through
the dim-lit halls of the great mansion rang a piercing cry.For when
he awoke, the curtain stood raised upon his life; and the sight of its
ghastly content struck wild terror to his naked soul.He had dreamed as he lay there, dreamed while the mist was rising.He
thought he had been toiling with feverish energy through those black
hours, building a wall about the things that were his.And into the
design of the huge structure he had fitted the trophies of his
conquest.Gannette toiled with him, straining, sweating, groaning.Together they reared that monstrous wall; and as they labored, the man
plotted the death of his companion when the work should be done, lest
he ask for pay.And into the corners of the wall they fitted little
skulls.These were the children of Avon who had never played.And over
the great stones which they heaved into place they sketched red
dollar-marks; and their paint was human blood.A soft wind swept over
the rising structure, and it bore a gentle voice: "I am Love."But the
toilers looked up and cursed.And over the rim of the wall looked fair faces."We are
Truth, we are Life!"But the men frothed with fury, and hurled skulls
at the faces, and bade them begone!A youth and a tender girl looked
down at the sweating toilers."We ask help; we are young, and times
are so hard!"And then the darkness settled down,
for the wall was now so high that it shut out the sun.And the great
man howled with laughter; the wall was done.So he turned and smote
his companion unto death, and dipped his hands in the warm blood of
the quivering corpse.And then he sought to
mount the wall.But his hands slipped on the human blood of the red,
slimy dollar-marks, and he fell crashing back among his tinkling
treasures.The naked, splitting skulls
leered at him.The toothless jaws clattered, and the eyeless sockets
glowed eerily.He begged that a rope be
lowered.He would go out once more into the sunlit world.But the
chill wind brought him only despairing moans.Then he rushed madly to the wall, and smote it with his bare hands.It
mocked him with the strength which he had given it.He turned and tore
his hair and flesh.He gnashed his teeth until they broke into bits.He cursed; he raved; he pleaded; he offered all his great treasure for
freedom.But the skulls grinned their horrid mockery at him; and the
blood on the stones dripped upon his burning head.And above it all he
heard the low plotting of those without who were awaiting his death,
that they might throw down the wall and take away his treasure.And then his fear became frenzy; his love of gold turned to horror;
his reason fled; and he dashed himself wildly against the prison which
he had reared, until he fell, bleeding and broken.And as he fell, he
heard the shrill cackle of demons that danced their hellish steps on
the top of the wall.Then the Furies flew down and bound him tight."Ah, my God, What might I not have made of Thy fair world Had I
  but loved Thy highest creature here?It was my duty to have loved
  the highest; It surely was my profit had I known."Then he
sought to raise his arms, to move.And then the scream
tore from his dry throat.The physicians bent over him and
sought to soothe his mental agony.The man's torture was fearful to
behold; his weakness, pitiable.But the
sleep was one of unbroken horror; and those in the room stopped in the
course of their duties; and their faces blanched; and they held their
hands to their ears, when his awful moans echoed through the curtained
room.Through his dreams raced the endless panorama of his crowded life.Now
he was wading through muddy slums where stood the wretched houses
which he rented for immoral purposes.And then he hurried to Avon; and there he dug into those fresh
graves--dug, dug, dug, throwing the dirt up in great heaps behind him.And into the face of each corpse as he dragged it out of its damp bed
he peered eagerly.But with awful moans he threw them from him in
turn, for she was not there.Then he fled down, down, far into the burning South; and there he
roamed the trackless wastes, calling her name.And the wild beasts and
the hissing serpents looked out at him from the thick bush, looked
with great, red eyes, and then fled from him with loathing.And,
suddenly, he came upon another mound near the banks of a great river.And over it stood a rude cross; and on the cross he read the dim,
penciled word, _Dolores_.how he cried out for the oblivion
that was not his.But the ghastly mound froze his blood, and he rushed
from it in terror, and fell, whirling over and over, down, down into
eternal blackness filled with dying men's groans!The exhausted attendants stood about
the bed with bated breath.The physicians had called Doctor Morton in
consultation, for the latter was a brain specialist.And while they
sat gazing at the crazed, stricken giant, hopelessly struggling to
lift the inert mass of his dead body, Reverend Darius Borwell entered.He bowed silently to them all; then went to the bedside and took the
patient's hand.A moment later he turned to the physicians and
nurses."Let us ask God's help for Mr.They bowed, and he knelt beside the bed and prayed long and earnestly;
prayed that the loving Father who had made man in His image would take
pity on the suffering one who lay there, and, if it be His will, spare
him for Jesus' sake.He arose from his knees, and they all sat quiet for some moments.Then
Doctor Morton's heavy voice broke the silence of death.Borwell,"
he said in awful earnestness, extending his hand toward the bed, "cure
that man, if your religion is anything more than a name!"A hot flush of indignation spread over the minister's face; but he did
not reply."Gentlemen," he said solemnly, "Mr.Ames, I think, is past our aid.There is nothing on earth that can save him.If he lives, he will be
hopelessly insane.""Upstairs, sir, in her apartments," answered the maid, wiping her red
eyes."See that she remains there," said the doctor gruffly."Gentlemen,"
turning again to the physicians, "I have but one suggestion.Send
for--for--that little girl, Carmen.""It is ill-advised, Doctor," interrupted one of the men."It would
only further excite him."I do not agree with you," returned Doctor Morton."As it is, he is
doomed.With her here--there may be a chance."The others shook their heads; but Doctor Morton persisted stubbornly."If she is sent for, I shall
retire from the case.""Very well," announced Doctor Morton evenly, "then I will take it
myself."He rose and went out into the vestibule where there was a
telephone.Calling for the Beaubien cottage, he gave a peremptory
order that Carmen come at once in the automobile which he was sending
for her.The Beaubien turned from the telephone to the girl."Why--is it--is he--"

"They say he is--dying," the woman whispered.Carmen stood for a minute as if stunned."Why--I--didn't know--that
there was--anything wrong.The Beaubien threw her arms around the girl.Father Waite rose from
the table where he had been writing, and came to them.A few minutes later the great bronze doors of the Ames mansion swung
wide to admit the daughter of the house.Doctor Morton met the wondering girl, and led her directly into the
sick-room."Miss Carmen," he said gravely, "Mr.The girl turned upon him like a flash from a clear sky."You mean, he
_shall_ not live!"Then a sense of her
magnificent environment, of her strange position, and of the vivid
events of the past few hours swept over her, and she became
embarrassed.The nurses and attendants, too, who stood about and
stared so hard at her, added to her confusion."Listen," he said, "I am leaving now,
but you will remain.If I am needed, one of the maids will summon
me."Carmen stood for a moment without speaking.Then she walked slowly to
the bed and looked down at the man.Doctor Morton motioned to the
attendants to withdraw.Then he himself stepped softly out and closed
the door.When the girl turned around, she was alone--with death.CHAPTER 19


A curious, gossiping world, dwelling only in the froth of the human
mind, will not comprehend for many a year to come what took place in
that dim, tapestried chamber of the rich man in those next hours.When
twilight began to steal through the marble halls of the great,
shrouded mansion, the nurse in charge, becoming apprehensive, softly
opened the door of the sick-room and peeped in.Through the darkness
she saw the girl, sitting beside the bed, with the man's right hand
clasped in both of hers, and her head resting upon his shoulder.And
the nurse quickly closed the door again in awe, and stole away.The girl sat there all that day and all that night, nor would leave
but for brief moments to eat, or to reassure the Beaubien over the
telephone that all was well.Doctor Morton came, and went, and came
again.Carmen smiled, and held his hand for a moment each time, but
said little.And, more, his cheeks were stained where
the scalding tears had coursed down them.But the doctor would ask no
questions.And three days and nights passed thus, while Carmen dwelt with the man
who, as the incarnation of error, seeking the destruction of others,
had destroyed himself.Then Doctor Morton announced to a waiting world that his patient would
live--but he would say no more.And the world heard, too, that
Kathleen Ames had left her father's roof--left in humiliation and
chagrin when she learned that Carmen had come there to live--and had
gone to England for a prolonged visit with the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her now thoroughly dismayed son.But Sidney came; and with
him the black-veiled Beaubien.And they both knelt beside the bed of
suffering; and the hand of the now quiet man slowly went out and lay
for a moment upon their bowed heads, while Carmen stood near.Then
Willett was sent for; and he came often after that, and took his
master's scarce audible instructions, and went away again to touch the
wires and keys that ended the war of hatred at Avon; that brought
Father Danny in the master's private car to the great metropolitan
hospital; that sent to the startled Hitt the canceled mortgage papers
on the Express; and that inaugurated that great work of restitution
which held the dwellers in the Ames mansion toiling over musty books
and forgotten records for months to come.What had passed between the man and the sweet-faced girl who hovered
over him like a ray of light, no one may know.That he had trod the
glowing embers of hell, his cavernous, deep-lined face and whitening
hair well testified.It was said afterward that on that third day he
had opened his eyes and looked straight into those of the girl.It was
said that she then whispered but one word, "Father."And that, when
the sound of her low voice fell upon his straining ears, he had
reached out the arm that still held life, and had drawn her head down
upon his breast, and wept like a motherless babe.But what he had
said, if aught, about the abandoned mother who, on the banks of the
distant river, years gone, had yielded her life to him and his child,
no one knew.Of but one thing was there any certainty: the name of
Padre Jose de Rincon had not crossed their lips during those dark
days.Then strong men lifted the giant from his bed
and placed him in a wheel chair; and Carmen drew the chair out into
the conservatory, among the ferns and flowers, and sat beside him, his
hand still clasped in both of hers.That he had found life, no one who
marked his tense, eager look, which in every waking moment lay upon
the girl, could deny.His body was dead; his soul was fluttering
feebly into a new sense of being.But with the awakening of conscience, in the birth-throes of a new
life, came the horrors, the tortures, the wild frenzy of self-loathing;
and, but for the girl who clung so desperately to him, he would have
quickly ended his useless existence.The stage upon which the curtain had risen,
whereon he saw the hourly portrayal of his own fiendish deeds, stood
always before him like a haunting spectre; and as he gazed with
horrified eyes, his hair grew hourly white.And the torture was rendered more poignant by the demands of his
erstwhile associates and henchmen.They had taken fright at the first
orders which had issued from the sick-bed, but now they swooped down
upon the harassed man to learn what might be expected from him in the
future.What were to be his policies now in regard to those manifold
interests which he was pursuing with such vigor a few weeks ago?Was
he still bent upon depriving Senator Gossitch of the seat which the
Ames money had purchased?The
Amalgamated Spinners' Association must know at once his further plans.His great railroad projects, his
mining ventures, his cotton deals, his speculations and gambling
schemes--whither should they tend now?Ward bosses, dive keepers,
bank presidents, lawyers, magnates, and preachers clamored for
admission at his doors when they learned that he would live, but that
a marvelous, incomprehensible change had swept over him.The tired, hectored man turned to Carmen.And she called Hitt and
Waite and the keen-minded Beaubien.The latter's wide business
experience and worldly knowledge now stood them all in good stead, and
she threw herself like a bulwark between the stricken man and the
hounds that roared at his gates.There were those among them who, like
Ames, had bitterly fought all efforts at industrial and social reform,
and yet who saw the dawning of a new era in the realms of finance, of
politics, of religion.There were those who sensed the slow awakening
of the world-conscience, and who resisted it desperately, and who now
sat frightened and angered at the thought of losing their great
leader.Their attitude toward life, like his, had been wrong from the
beginning; they, like him, were striking examples of the dire effects
of a false viewpoint in the impoverishing of human life.But, with
him, they had built up a tremendous material fabric.And now they
shook with fear as they saw its chief support removed.For they must
know that his was a type that was fast passing, and after it must come
the complete breakdown of the old financial order.His world-embracing
gambling--which touched all men in some way, for it had to do with the
very necessities of life, with crops, with railroads, with industries,
and out of which he had coined untold millions--had ceased forever.And to him also came Reverend Darius Borwell, in whose congregation
sat sanctimonious malefactors of vast wealth, whose pockets bulged
with disease-laden profits from the sales of women's bodies and souls.Reverend Borwell came to offer the sufferer the dubious consolations
of religion--and inquire if his beautiful change of heart would affect
the benefaction which he had designed for the new church.Ah, this was the hour when the fallen giant faced the Apostle's awful
question: What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed?_For the end of those things is death!_

And then came Monsignor Lafelle, asking not to see the sick man, but
the girl.And, alone with her in the great library that day, he bent
low over her hand and begged that she would forgive and forget.Ames that flagrantly false tale of the girl's
parentage.He had received it from Wenceslas, in Cartagena.It was he
who, surmising the dark secret of Ames, had concluded that the
supposed Infanta had been his wife.And he had returned to New York
to confront him with the charge, and to make great capital out of it.But he had never suspected for a moment Carmen's connection with the
mystery.And now--

But the girl saw only the image of God in the humiliated man.And when
he kissed her hand and departed, she bade him know, always, that she
loved him as a brother.And he knew it, knew that her love was of the
spirit--it left all for the Christ.A few days later there was delivered at the Ames mansion a cable
message from Cartagena, in reply to one which the master had sent to
the lawyer, Estrella.Ames shook with suppressed excitement when he
read it.Then he bade Carmen send at once for Hitt, Willett, and
Captain McCall, and leave them with him for a private conference.Ames repeated, as the three
men sat leaning eagerly forward an hour later, drinking in every word
he spoke."If the mission is successful, well and good.If it fails,
then our silence now will be justified, for as yet I have said nothing
to her regarding him.Wenceslas has
won--but with--but of that later.When can you get under way,
McCall?"The sudden flash of his old-time energy nearly startled them
from their chairs."And," he added, "you, Mr.Now, Willett, have the door of my limousine widened to accommodate
this wheel chair.I want a dozen men to insure our privacy, and to
keep the way clear.No one not in our confidence must see us depart.""But--Carmen--"

"Goes with us," returned Ames."I can not spare her for a moment.Madam Beaubien will have charge of the house during our absence.We
will be back here, weather favorable, in three weeks--or not at all!""Yet, she will know--"

"Nothing.I take the trip, ostensibly, for the change; to get away
from those who are hounding me here; for recuperation--anything!The man's eyes glistened like live coals, and
his sunken cheeks took on a feverish glow.That night the _Cossack_, enveloped in gloom, steamed noiselessly out
of New York harbor, and turned her prow to the South.And when she
had entered the high sea, Captain McCall from his bridge aloft sent a
message down to the waiting engineer:

"Full speed ahead!"CHAPTER 20


Cartagena's slumber of centuries had been broken by nearly four years
of civil warfare.But on the day that the lookout in the abandoned
convent of Santa Candelaria, on the summit of La Popa, flashed the
message down into the old city that a steam yacht had appeared on the
northern horizon, she was preparing to sink back again into quiet
dreams.For peace was being concluded among the warring political
factions.The country lay devastated and blood-soaked; but the cause
of Christ had triumphed, and the Church still sat supreme in the
councils of Bogota.Cartagena was _en fete_; the last of the political
agitators would be executed on the morrow.And so the lookout's
message was received with indifference, even though he embellished it
with the comment that the boat must be privately owned, as no ships of
the regular lines were due to arrive that day.Quietly the graceful craft swept down past Tierra Bomba and into the
Boca Chica, between the ancient forts of San Fernando and San Jose,
and came to anchor out in the beautiful harbor, a half mile from the
ancient gate of the clock.A few curious idlers along the shore
watched it and commented on its perfect lines.And the numerous
officials of the port lazily craned their necks at it, and yawningly
awaited the arrival of the skiff that was immediately lowered and
headed for the pier.The tall American who stepped from the little boat and came at once to
them to show his papers, easily satisfied their curiosity, for many
tourists of the millionaire class dropped anchor in Cartagena's
wonderful harbor, and came ashore to wander among the decaying
mementos of her glorious past.And this boat was not a stranger to
these waters.On the yacht itself, as they glanced again toward it,
there was no sign of life.Even the diminishing volume of smoke that
rose from its funnels evidenced the owner's intention of spending some
time in that romantic spot.From the dock, Hitt passed through the old gateway in the massive
wall, quickly crossed the _Plaza de Coches_, and lost himself in the
gay throngs that were entering upon the day's festivities.Occasionally he dropped into wine shops and little stores, and
lingered about to catch stray bits of gossip.Then he slowly made his
way up past the Cathedral and into the _Plaza de Simon Bolivar_.For a while, sitting on a bench in front of the equestrian statue of
the famous _Libertador_, he watched the passing crowds.From time to
time his glance strayed over toward the Cathedral.Once he rose, and
started in that direction; then came back and resumed his seat.It was
evident that he was driven hard, and yet knew not just what course to
pursue.Finally he jumped to his feet and went over to a little cigar store
which had caught his eye.He bent over the soiled glass case and
selected several cigars from the shabby stock.Putting one of them
into his mouth, he lighted it, and then casually nodded to a
powerfully built man standing near.The latter turned to the proprietor and made some comment in Spanish.Hitt immediately replied to it in the same tongue.The man flushed
with embarrassment; then doffed his hat and offered an apology."I
forget, senor," he said, "that so many Americans speak our language."Hitt held out his hand and laughed heartily at the incident.Then his
eye was attracted by a chain which the man wore."_Cierto_, _senor_," returned the man cordially."It came from an
Indian grave up in Guamoco.I am a _guaquero_--grave digger--by
profession; Jorge Costal, by name."Somehow he seemed to be familiar with that
name.Somewhere he seemed to have heard it."Suppose," he said, in his excellent Spanish, "that we cross
the _Plaza_ to yonder wine shop.You may be able to tell me some of
the history of this interesting old town.And--it would be a great
favor, senor."The man bowed courteously and accepted the invitation.A few moments
later they sat at a little table, with a bottle between them,
commenting on the animated scene in the street without."Peace will be concluded to-day, they say," reflected Hitt, by way of
introduction."Yes," returned the man grimly, "there is but little more blood to
let."The other is--"

He stopped and eyed Hitt furtively.But the American manifested only a
casual interest."They were posted this morning," said the man."Amado Jesus Fanor and
Jose de Rincon.""A liberal general and an ex-priest."It is the custom to--to shoot ex-priests down
here, eh?"But this man--senor, why do you ask?""Well--it struck me as curious--that's all," returned Hitt, at a loss
for a suitable answer."You didn't happen to know these men, I
presume?""_Na_, _senor_, you seek to involve me.Who are you, that you ask such
questions of a stranger?"The man reflected the suspicious caution of
these troublous times."Why, _amigo_, it is of no concern to me," replied Hitt easily,
flicking the ashes from his cigar."I once knew a fellow by that name.Learned that he afterward went to Simiti.But
I--"

"Senor!""Are you the _Americano_, the man
who explored?""I am," said Hitt, bending closer to him."And we are well met, for
you are Don Jorge, who knew Padre Jose de Rincon in Simiti, no?"The man cast a timid glance around the room."Senor," he whispered,
"we must not say these things here!I leave you now--"

"Not yet!"He was first three years in the prison in Cartagena.But the Bish--"

"Eh?Don Wenceslas had him removed to San Fernando?""And--"

"He will be shot to-morrow, senor.""Why do you
say he is an ex-priest?""He has just been excommunicated," replied the man."Cursed, they say,
by bell, book, and candle."Of course Don Wenceslas would not dare to execute a priest in
good standing.And so he had him excommunicated, eh?""_Quien sabe?_" he muttered.Hitt sat for a while in a deep study.And yet it
was flying like the winds."You knew a little girl--in Simiti--in whom this Rincon was
interested?"She went to the great States
from which you come.And I think little was heard from her after
that."She lived with--"

"Don Rosendo Ariza.""Dead--he and his good wife, Dona Maria.""Come," he said, "we will stroll down by the walls.I would
like a look at San Fernando."Senor, you--you--"

Hitt threw him a look of caution, and shook his head.Then, motioning
him to follow, he led him out and down through the winding, tortuous
thoroughfares.On the summit of the walls were sentinels, posted at
frequent intervals; and no civilian might walk upon the great
enclosure until peace had been formally declared.Hailing a passing carriage, Hitt urged the wondering Don Jorge into
it, and bade the driver convey them to the old ruin of San Felipe, and
leave them.There they climbed the broken incline into the battered
fortress, and seated themselves in the shadow of a crumbling parapet.They were alone on the enormous, grass-grown pile.From their position
they commanded a wonderful view across the town and harbor, and far
out over the green waters of the Caribbean.The _Cossack_ lay asleep
in the quiet harbor.Don Jorge saw it, and wondered whence it came."Listen, _amigo_," began Hitt, pointing to the yacht."In that boat is
a girl, whose dearest earthly treasure is the condemned prisoner out
there in San Fernando.That girl is the little Carmen, foster-daughter
of old Rosendo.""_Hombre!_" cried Don Jorge, staring at Hitt as if he suspected his
sanity."It is true, friend, for I myself came with her in that boat.""_Caramba!_"

"And," continued Hitt, glancing again about the ruined fortress and
lowering his voice, "we have come for Jose de Rincon.""_Santa Virgen!_ Are you _loco_?""And now," he went on eagerly, "how are we to get him?"And he--_por
supuesto_, he will be in the dungeons!""No doubt," returned Hitt dryly, "if your excellent friend Wenceslas
has had anything to do with it."_Caramba_, yes; and San Fernando's are just above the water's edge.And when the waves are high the sea pours into them!""And--could we learn which window is his, do you think?""Senor, I know," replied the man.And--"

"I learned from one of the soldiers, Fernando, who once lived in
Simiti.I had thought, senor, that--that perhaps I--"

"That perhaps you might make the attempt yourself, eh?"Hitt sprang to his feet and looked out toward the
silent fortress."Don Jorge, it is dark out over the harbor at night, eh?Suddenly he stopped, and stood
looking down through a hole in the broken pavement.Then he knelt and
peered long and eagerly into it."It is one of the rooms
of the fortress," he said.I know not how it may be
reached.""But--you are a mighty husky fellow; and I am not weak.Suppose we try
lifting one of these flags.""_Na_, _senor_, as well try the tunnels!But, bidding Don Jorge follow, he sought the
fallen entrance to the old fortress, and plunged into the dark passage
that led off from it into the thick gloom.Groping his way down a
long, damp corridor, he came to a point where three narrower,
brick-lined tunnels branched off, one of them dipping into the earth
at a sharp angle.He struck a match, and then started down this,
followed by the wondering Don Jorge.A thousand bats, hideous denizens of these black tunnels, flouted
their faces and disputed their progress.Don Jorge slapped wildly at
them, and cursed low.Hitt took up a long club and struck savagely
about him.On they stumbled, until the match flickered out, and they
were left in Stygian blackness, with the imps of darkness whirring
madly about them.Hitt struck another match, and plunged ahead.At length they found the way blocked by a mass of rubbish which had
fallen from the roof.Hitt studied it for a moment, then climbed upon
it and, by the aid of the feeble light from his matches, peered into
the foul blackness beyond."Come," he said, preparing to proceed."_Na, amigo!_ Not I!""Then wait for me here," said Hitt, pushing himself through the narrow
aperture at the top of the rubbish, and fighting the horde of
terrified bats.A few minutes later he returned, covered with slime, and scratched and
bleeding."Now let's get out of this
miserable hole!"Out in the sunlight once more, Hitt sought to remove the stains from
his clothes, meanwhile bidding Don Jorge attend well to his words."Then do you come to the beach to-night to bathe, down across from the
yacht.And, listen well: you would do much for the little Carmen, no?You will swim out to the yacht at
seven to-night, with your clothes in a bundle on your head, eh?And,
Don Jorge--but we will discuss that later.Now you go back to the city
alone.And, note this, you have not seen me."Meantime, to the group of politicians, soldiers, and clergy assembled
in the long audience room of the departmental offices to debate the
terms of the peace protocol, news of the arrival of the _Cossack_ was
brought by a slow-moving messenger from the dock.At the abrupt
announcement the acting-Bishop was seen to start from his chair._Quien sabe?_ And, if so--but,
impossible!He would have advised his faithful co-laborer of his
coming.And yet, what were those strange rumors which had trickled
over the wires, and which, in his absorption in the local issues, and
in the excitement attendant upon the restoration of peace and the
settlement of the multifold claims of innumerable greedy politicians,
he had all but forgotten?A thousand suggestions flashed through his
mind, any one of which might account for the presence of the _Cossack_
in Cartagena's harbor that day.But extreme caution must be observed
until he might ascertain its errand.He therefore despatched a message
to the yacht, expressing his great surprise and pleasure, and bidding
its master meet him at a convenient hour in his study in the
Cathedral.This done, he bent anew to the work before him, yet with
his thought harried by doubt, suspicion, and torturing curiosity.Wenceslas soon received a reply to his message.The master was aboard,
but unable to go ashore.The acting-Bishop would therefore come to him
at once.Wenceslas hesitated, and his brow furrowed.He knew he was called upon
to render his reckoning to the great financier who had furnished the
sinews of war.But he must have time to consider thoroughly his own
advantage, for well he understood that he was summoned to match his
own keen wits with those of a master mind.And then there flashed through his thought the reports which had
circled the world but three short weeks before.The man of wealth had
found his daughter; and she was the girl for whom the two Americans
had outwitted him four years ago!And the girl--Simiti--and--ah,
Rincon!He would meet the financier--but
not until the morrow, at noon, for, he would allege, the unanticipated
arrival of Ames had found this day completely occupied.So he again
despatched his wondering messenger to the _Cossack_.And that
messenger was rowed out to the quiet yacht in the same boat with the
tall American, whose clothes were torn and caked with mud, and in
whose eyes there glowed a fierce determination.The harbingers of the wet season had
already arrived.At two in the morning the rain came, descending in a
torrent.In the midst of it a light skiff, rocking dangerously on the
swelling sea, rounded a corner of San Fernando and crept like a shadow
along the dull gray wall.The sentry above had taken shelter from the
driving rain.At one of the narrow, grated windows which were set just above the
water's surface the skiff hung, and a long form arose from its depths
and grasped the iron bars.A moment later the gleam of an electric
lantern flashed into the blackness within.It fell upon a rough bench,
standing in foul, slime-covered water.Upon the bench sat the huddled
form of a man.Then another dark shape rose in the skiff.Another pair of hands laid
hold on the iron bars.And behind those great, calloused hands
stretched thick arms, with the strength of an ox.An iron lever was
inserted between the bars.The heavy breathing and the low sounds of
the straining were drowned by the tropic storm.The prisoner leaped
from the bench and stood ankle-deep in the water, straining his eyes
upward.His
throbbing ears caught the splash of a knotted rope falling into the
water at his feet.Above the noise of the rain he thought he heard a
groaning, creaking sound.Those rusted, storm-eaten bars in the
blackness above must be slowly yielding to an awful pressure.He
turned and dragged the slime-covered bench to the window, and stood
upon it.Then he grasped the rope with a strength born anew of hope
and excitement, and pulled himself upward.The hands from without
seized him; and slowly, painfully, his emaciated body was crushed
through the narrow space between the bent bars.*       *       *       *       *

Cartagena awoke to experience another thrill.And then the ripple of
excitement gave place to anger.The rabble had lost one of its
victims, and that one the chief.Moreover, the presence of that
graceful yacht, sleeping so quietly out there in the sunlit harbor,
could not but be associated with that most daring deed of the
preceding night, which had given liberty to the excommunicated priest
and political malefactor, Jose de Rincon.Crowds of chattering,
gesticulating citizens gathered along the harbor shores, and loudly
voiced their disappointment and threats.But the boat lay like a thing
asleep.Not even a wisp of smoke rose from its yellow funnels.Then came the Alcalde, and the Departmental Governor, grave and
sedate, with their aids and secretaries, their books and documents,
their mandates and red-sealed processes, and were rowed out to
confront the master whom they believed to have dared to thwart the
hand of justice and remain to taunt them with his egregious presence.This should be made an international episode, whose ramifications
would wind down through years to come, and embrace long, stupid
congressional debates, apologies demanded, huge sums to salve a
wounded nation, and the making and breaking of politicians too
numerous to mention!But the giant who received them, bound to his chair, in the splendid
library of the palatial yacht, and with no attendant, save a single
valet, flared out in a towering rage at the gross insult offered him
and his great country in these black charges.He had come on a
peaceful errand; partly, too, for reasons of health.And he was at
that moment awaiting a visit from His Grace.What manner of reception
was this, that Cartagena extended to an influential representative of
the powerful States of the North!"But," the discomfited Indignation Committee gasped, "what of the tall
American who was seen to land the day before?"Why, but a poor, obsessed
archaeologist, now prowling around the ruins of San Felipe, doubtless
mumbling childishly as he <DW8>s the dust and mold of centuries!Go,
visit him, if they would be convinced!And when these had gone, chagrined and mortified--though filled
with wonder, for they had roamed the _Cossack_, and peered into
its every nook and cranny, and stopped to look a second time at the
fair-haired young boy who looked like a girl, and hovered close to
the master--came His Grace, Wenceslas.He came alone, and with a sneer
curling his imperious lips.And his calm, arrogant eyes held a
meaning that boded no good to the man who sat in his wheel chair,
alone, and could not rise to welcome him."A very pretty trick, my powerful friend," said the angered churchman
in his perfect English."And one that will cause your Government at
Washington some--"

"Enough!""I sent for you
yesterday, intending to ask you to release the man.I had terms then
which would have advantaged you greatly.You were afraid to see me
until you had evolved your plans of opposition.Only a fixed and
devilish hatred, nourished by you against a harmless priest who
possessed your secrets, doomed him to die to-day.But we will pass
that for the present.I have here my demands for the aid I have
furnished you.He held out some typewritten
sheets to Wenceslas.The churchman glanced hastily over them; then handed them back with a
smile."The terms on which
peace is concluded will scarcely admit of--"

"Very well," returned Ames quietly."_En manos muertas_, my friend," he replied.A government monopoly, you know," said His Grace easily."You see, my friend, it is a costly matter to effect the escape of
state prisoners.As things stand now, your little trick of last night
quite protects me.For, first you instruct me, long ago, to place the
weak little Jose in San Fernando; and I obey.Then you suffer a change
of heart, and slip down here to release the man, who has become a
state prisoner.That quite removes you from any claims upon us for a
share of the spoils of war.I take it, you do not wish to risk
exposure of your part in this four years' carnage?""Wenceslas," he
said, "I am not the man with whom you dealt in these matters.I have but one thing more to say, and that is that I renounce
all claims upon you and your Government, excepting one.La Libertad
mine was owned by the Rincon family.It was rediscovered by old
Rosendo, and the title transferred to his foster-daughter.Its
possession must remain with her and her associates.There is no
record, so you have informed me, to the effect that the Church
possesses this mine.""But, my friend, there shall be such a record to-day," laughed
Wenceslas."And, in your present situation, you will hardly care to
contest it."He now had the information which he had been seeking.The
title to the famous mine lay still with the Simiti company.He pressed
the call-button attached to his chair.The door opened, and Don Jorge
entered, leading the erstwhile little newsboy, Jose de Rincon, by the
hand.He knew not the man; but the boy
was a familiar figure."Your Grace, were you married to the woman by whom you had this son?"Don Jorge's steady words fell upon the churchman's ears like a
sentence of death."I ask," continued the dark-faced man, "because I learned last night
that the lad's mother was my daughter, the little Maria.""_Santa Virgen!_"

"Yes, Your Grace, a sainted virgin, despoiled by a devil!And the man
who gave me this information--would you like to know?_Bien_, it was
Padre Jose de Rincon, in whose arms she died, you lecherous dog!"Wenceslas paled, and his brow grew moist.He stared at the boy, and
then at the strong man whom he had so foully wronged."If you have concluded your talk with Senor Ames," continued Don
Jorge, "we will go ashore--you and the lad and I."Gaining the deck, Wenceslas
found a skiff awaiting them, and two strong sailors at the oars.Don
Jorge urged him on, and together they descended the ladder and entered
the boat.A few moments later they landed at the pier, and the skiff
turned back to the yacht.There were some who
remembered seeing His Grace pass through the narrow streets with a
dark-skinned, powerful man, whose hand grasped that of the young
newsboy.There were others who said that they saw the boy leave them
at the Cathedral, and the two men turn and enter.Still others said
they saw the heavy-set man come out alone.But there was only one who
discovered the body of Wenceslas, crumpled up in a hideous heap upon
the floor of his study, with a poignard driven clean through his
heart.That man was the old sexton, who fled screaming from the awful
sight late that afternoon.Again Cartagena shook with excitement, and seethed with mystery.Had
the escaped prisoner, Rincon, returned to commit this awful deed?For the dark-skinned man who had
entered the Cathedral with His Grace was seen again on the streets and
in the wine shops that afternoon, and had been marked by some mounting
the broken incline of San Felipe.Again the Governor and Alcalde and their numerous suite paid a visit
to the master on board the _Cossack_.But they learned only that His
Grace had gone ashore long before he met his fearful death.And so the
Governor returned to the city, and was driven to San Felipe.But his
only reward was the sight of the obsessed archaeologist, mud-stained
and absorbed, prying about the old ruins, and uttering little cries of
delight at new discoveries of crumbling passageways and caving rooms.And so there was nothing for the disturbed town to do but settle down
and ponder the strange case.A week later smoke was seen again pouring out of the _Cossack's_
funnels.That same day the Governor and Alcalde and their suites were
bidden to a farewell banquet on board the luxurious yacht.Far into
the night they sat over their rare wines and rich food, drinking deep
healths to the _entente cordial_ which existed between the little
republic of the South and the great one of the North.And while they
drank and sang and listened enraptured to the wonderful pipe-organ, a
little boat put out from the dark, tangled shrubbery along the shore.And when it rubbed against the yacht, a muffled figure mounted the
ladder which hung in the shadows, and hastened through the rear
hatchway and down into the depths of the boat.Then, long after
midnight, the last farewell being said by the dizzy officials, and the
echoes of _Adios_, _adios_, _amigos_!lingering among its tall spars,
the _Cossack_ slipped noiselessly out of the Boca Chica, and set its
course for New York.A few hours later, while the boat sped swiftly through the phosphorescent
waves, the escaped prisoner, Jose de Rincon, who had lain for a week
hidden in the bowels of old fort San Felipe, stood alone in the wonderful
smoking room of the _Cossack_, and looked up at the sweet face pictured
in the stained-glass window above.And then he turned quickly, for the
door opened and a girl entered.A rush, a cry of joy, and his arms
closed about the fair vision that had sat by his side constantly during
the four long years of his imprisonment."I knew you would, for he was with you always!""But--oh, you beautiful, beautiful girl!"Then in a little while she gently released herself and went to the
door through which she had entered.She paused for a moment to smile
back at the enraptured man, then turned and flung the door wide.The man uttered a loud
exclamation and started toward her.He stopped short and stared down at the boy.Then he looked
wonderingly at Carmen."Yes," she said, stooping and lifting the boy up before Jose, "it is
Anita's babe--_and he sees_!"The man clasped the child in his arms and buried his face in its
hair.Verily, upon them that sat in darkness had the Light shined.CHAPTER 21


Another summer had come and gone.Through the trees in Central Park
the afternoon sunlight, sifted and softened by the tinted autumn
leaves, spread over the brown turf like a gossamer web.And it fell
like a gentle benediction upon the massive figure of a man, walking
unsteadily beneath the trees, holding the hand of a young girl whose
beauty made every passer turn and look again."Now, father," laughed the girl, "once more!Why, you step off
like a major!"They were familiar figures, out there in the park, for almost daily
during the past few weeks they might have been seen, as the girl
laughingly said, "practicing their steps."And daily the man's control
became firmer; daily that limp left arm and leg seemed increasingly to
manifest life.On a bench near by sat a dark-featured woman.About her played her
boy, filling the air with his merry shouts and his imperfect English."There, father, comes Jose after us," announced the girl, looking off
with love-lit eyes at an approaching automobile.Now, mind, you are going to get into the car without any help!"The man laughed, and declared vehemently that if he could not get in
alone he would walk home.The profound depth of those changes which had come into the rich
man's life, he himself might not fathom.But those who toiled
daily with him over his great ledgers and files knew that the
transformation went far.There were flashes at times of his former
vigor and spirit of domination, but there were also periods of
grief that were heart-rending to behold, as when, poring over his
records for the name of one whom in years past he had ruthlessly
wrecked, he would find that the victim had gone in poverty beyond
his power to reimburse him.And again, when his thought dwelt on
Avon, and the carnal madness which had filled those new graves there,
he would sink moaning into his chair and bury his drawn face in his
hands and sob.And yet he strove madly, feverishly, to restore again to those from
whom he had taken.The Simiti company was revived, through his labors,
and the great La Libertad restored to its reanimated stockholders.Work of development had begun on the property, and Harris was again in
Colombia in charge of operations.The Express was booming, and the
rich man had consecrated himself to the carrying out of its clean
policies.The mills at Avon were running day and night; and in a new
location, far from the old-time "lungers' alley," long rows of little
cottages were going up for their employes.The lawyer Collins had been
removed, and Lewis Waite was to take his place within a week.Father
Danny, now recovered, rejoiced in resources such as he had never dared
hope to command.And so the rich man toiled--ah, God!if he had only known before that
in the happiness of others lay his own.If only he could have known
that but a moiety of his vast, unused income would have let floods of
sunshine into the lives of those dwarfed, stunted children who toiled
for him, and never played!Oh, if when he closed his mills in the dull
months he had but sent them and their tired mothers to the country
fields, how they would have risen up and called him blessed!If he
could have but known that he was his brother's keeper, and in a sense
that the world as yet knows not!For he is indeed wise who loves his
fellow-men; and he is a fool who hates them!The great Fifth Avenue mansion was dark, except where hung a cluster
of glowing bulbs over the rich mahogany table in the library.There
about that table sat the little group of searchers after God, with
their number augmented now in ways of which they could not have
dreamed.And Hitt, great-souled friend of the world, was speaking
again as had been his wont in the days now gone.Ah, yes, there is a
cure-all; there is a final answer to every ethical question, every
social, industrial, economic problem, the problems of liquor, poverty,
disease, war.And the remedy is so universal that it dissolves even
the tangles of tariff and theology.Ah, my friends, the
girl who came among us to'show the world what love will do' has
taught us by her own rich life--it is love.But not the sex-mesmerism,
the covetousness, the self-love, which mask behind that heavenly name.And to know Him is to receive that marvelous
Christ-principle which unlocks for mankind the door of harmony."No, the world's troubles are not the fault of one man, nor of many,
but of all who seek happiness in things material, and forget that the
real man is the likeness of spirit, and that joy is spiritual.The
trusts, and the men of wealth, are not all malefactors; the churches
are not wholly filled with evil men.But all, yes all, have'missed
the mark' through the belief that matter and evil are real, and must
grope amid sickness, poverty, crime, and death, until they are willing
to turn from such false beliefs, and from self, and seek their own in
the reflection of Him, who is Love, to their fellow-men.It is only as
men join to search for and apply the Christ-principle that they truly
unite to solve the world's sore problems and reveal the waiting
kingdom of harmony, which is always just at hand."In that day all shall know that cause and effect are mental.The man
who hears the tempter, the carnal mind's suggestion to enrich himself
materially at the cost of his brother, will know that it is but the
voice of mesmerism, that'man-killer from the beginning', which bids
him sever himself from his God, who alone is infinite abundance.The
society woman who flits like a gorgeous butterfly about the courts of
fashion, her precious days wasted in motoring, her nights at cards,
and whose vitality goes into dress, and into the watery schemes for
'who shall be greatest' in the dismal realm of the human mind, must
learn, willingly or through suffering, that her activities are but
mesmeric shams that counterfeit the divine activity which manifests in
joy and fullness for all.What is it but the Christ-knowledge, the knowledge of
good, and its correlated knowledge, that evil is only the mesmeric
lie which has engulfed the world?But, oh, the depths of that divine
knowledge!The knowledge which heals the sick, gives sight to the
blind, and opens the prisons to them that are captive!We who are
gathered here to-night, feeling in our midst that great, unseen
Presence which makes for righteousness, know now that 'in my flesh
shall I see God,' for we have indeed already seen and known Him."With them sat the man who, swept by the storms of error and the carnal
winds of destruction, had solved his problem, even as the girl by his
side told him he should, and had been found, when his foul prison
opened, sitting "clothed and in his right mind" at the feet of the
Christ.Jesus "saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit--God--like a
dove descending upon him--immediately the Spirit--carnal belief,
error, the lie--driveth him into the wilderness."And there he was
made to prove God.So Jose de Rincon, when the light had come, years
gone, in desolate Simiti, had been bidden to know the one God, and
none else.But he wavered when the floods of evil rolled over him; he
had looked longingly back; he had clung too tightly to the human
concept that walked with him like a shining light in those dark days.And so she had been taken from him, and he had been hurled into the
wilderness--alone with Him whom he must learn to know if he would see
Life.Then self-consciousness went out, in those four years of his
captivity, and he passed from thence into consciousness of God.Then his great world-knowledge he saw to have been wholly untrue.His
store of truth he saw to have been but relative at best.His knowledge
had rested, he then knew, upon viewpoints which had been utterly
false.And so, like Paul, he died that he might live.He crucified
Self, that he might resurrect the image of God."The world," resumed Hitt, "still worships false gods, though it
reaches out for Truth.Only a
state of consciousness, a consciousness of good, of joy and harmony.And
we are seeking to rid ourselves of the consciousness of evil, with
its sin, its disease and death.But, knowing now that consciousness
is mental activity, the activity of thought, can we not see that
harmony and immortality are within our grasp?Salvation is not from evil realities, but from the
false sense of evil, even as Jesus taught and proved.The only salvation
possible to mankind is in learning to think as Jesus did--not yielding
our mentalities daily to a hodge-podge of mixed thoughts of good and
evil, and then running to doctors and preachers when such yielding
brings its inevitable result in sickness and death.Jesus insisted that
the kingdom of heaven was within men, a tremendous potentiality
within each one of us.By removing hampering
false belief, by removing the limitations of superstition and human
opinion which hold its portals closed.True progress is the release of
mankind from materialism, with its enslaving drudgery, its woes, and
its inevitable death.Mankind's chief difficulty is ignorance of what
God is.He proved Him to be the
creator of the spiritual universe, but not the originator of the lie
of materiality.He showed matter to be but the manifestation of the
false belief that creation is material.He showed it to be but a
sense-impression, without life, without stability, without existence,
except the pseudo-existence which it has in the false thought of
which the human or carnal consciousness is formed.But the lack of
understanding of the real nature of matter, and the persistent belief in
the stability of its so-called laws, has resulted in centuries of
attempts to discredit the Bible records of his spiritual demonstrations
of God's omnipotence and immanence, and so has prevented the human mind
from accepting the proofs which it so eagerly sought.And now, after
nineteen centuries of so-called Christian teaching, the human mind
remains still deeply embedded in matter, and subject to the
consentaneous human beliefs which it calls material laws.Jesus
showed that it was the communal mortal mind, with its false beliefs
in matter, sin, disease, and death, that constituted 'the flesh'; he
showed that mortals are begotten of such false beliefs; he showed
that the material universe is but manifested human belief.And we
know from our own reasoning that we see not things, but our _thoughts_
of things; that we deal not with matter, but with material mental
concepts only.We know that the preachers have woefully missed the
mark, and that the medicines of the doctors have destroyed more lives
than wars and famine, and yet will we not learn of the Master?To reach
God through material thinking is utterly impossible, for He is spirit,
and He can be cognized only by a spiritual consciousness.Yet such a
consciousness is ours, if we will but have it."Ah, friends, God said: Let US make man in OUR image and likeness--let
Life, Love, Spirit make its spiritual reflection.But where is that
man to-day?Buried deep beneath the dogma and the crystallized human
beliefs of mortals--buried beneath 'the lie' which mankind accept
about truth.Nothing but _scientific_ religion will meet humanity's
dire needs and reveal that man.And scientific religion admits of
actual, practical proof.Christianity is as scientific as mathematics,
and quite as capable of demonstration.Its proofs lie in doing the
works of the Master.He is a Christian who does these works; he who
does not is none.Christianity is not a failure, but organized
ecclesiasticism, which always collapses before a world crisis, has
failed utterly.The hideous chicane of imperial government and
imperial religion against mankind has resulted in a Christian veneer,
which cracks at the first test and reveals the unchanged human brute
beneath.The nations which writhe in deadly embrace to-day have never
sought to prove God.They but emphasize the awful fact that the human
mind has no grasp upon the Principle which is God, and at a time of
crisis reverts almost instantly to the primitive, despite so-called
culture and civilization.Yes, religion as a perpetuation of ancient
human conceptions, of materialistic traditions and opinions of 'the
Fathers,' is a flat failure.By it the people of great nations have
been molded into servile submission to church and ruler--have been
persuaded that wretchedness and poverty are eternal--that heaven is a
realm beyond the grave, to which admission is a function of outward
oblation--and that surcease from ills here, or in the life to come, is
a gift of the Church.Can we wonder that commercialism is mistaken by
nations for progress?That king and emperor still call upon God to
bless their barbaric attempts at conquest?And that human existence
remains, what it has always been, a ghastly mockery of Life?"Healing the sick by applied Christianity is not the attempt to alter
a mental concept; it is the bringing out of harmony where before was
discord.He who indulges evil only
proves his belief in its reality and power.Christian healing is not
'mental suggestion,' wherein all thought is material.When evil
thinking is overcome, then the discords which result from it will
disappear from consciousness.Behind all
that the physical senses seem to see, know, and feel, is the spiritual
fact, perfect and eternal.Jesus healed the sick by establishing this
fact in the human consciousness.They must cease from the dust-man,
whose breath is in his nostrils; they must cease from preaching evil
as an awful reality, permitted by God, or existing despite Him; they
must know it as Jesus bade all men know it, as the lie about Truth.Then, by holding the divine ideal before the human mind, they will
cause that mentality gradually to relinquish its false beliefs and
copy the real.And thus, step by step, changing from better to better
beliefs, at length the human mind will have completely substituted
reality for unreality, and will be no more, even in thought.The 'old
man' will have given place to the 'new.'Yes, for the present we reckon with material
symbols; we have not yet fully learned their unreality.But at length,
if we are faithful, we shall lay them aside, and know only Truth and
its pure manifestations."Ah, my friends, how simple is Christianity!It is summed up in the
Sermon on the Mount.He who thinks
right shall know things as they are.He who thinks wrong shall seem to
know them as they are not, and shall pass his days in sore travail,
even in wars, famine, and utter misery.Then why not take up the
demonstration of Christianity in the spirit of joy and freedom from
prejudice with which we pursue our earthly studies, and as gladly,
thankfully seek to prove it?For it, of all things, is worth while.It
alone is the true business of men.For if what we have developed in
our many talks regarding God, man, and the mental nature of the
universe and all things is true, then are the things with which men
now occupy themselves worth while?But are the
things which we have developed true?Yes, for they can be and have
been demonstrated.Carmen has
shown us the way.No, she is not unnatural; she is only divinely
natural.She has shown us what we all may become, if we but will.She
has shown us what we shall be able to do when we are completely lost
in accord with God, and recognize no other life, substance, nor law
than His.But--

"'I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create
evil,' cried the prophet._Truth always has its suppositional
opposite!_ Choose ye then whom ye will serve.Only that which is demonstrably true, not after the change which we
call death, but here this side of the grave, can stand.The only test
of a Christian is in the'signs following.'Without them his faith is
but sterile human belief, and his god but the distorted human concept
whom kings beseech to bless their slaughter."'Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein
  is he to be accounted of?"'His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very
  day his thoughts perish."'That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
  of the Spirit is spirit."'Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though
  we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we
  him no more.'"The fire crackled briskly on the great hearth.Carmen rose and turned
off the light above them.All drew their chairs about the cheery
blaze.Silence, sacred, holy, lay upon them.The rich man, now possessing
treasures beyond his wildest dreams, sat holding his daughter's hand.Sidney had just entered; and Haynerd had
sent word that he would join them soon.Then the silence was broken by the rich man.His voice was unsteady
and low."My friends, sorrow and joy fill my heart to-night.To the first I am
resigned; it is my due; and yet, were it greater, I know not how I
could live.But the joy--who can understand it until he has passed
through death into life!This little girl's mother knew not, nor did
I, that she was royal born.Sometimes I wonder now if it is really so.And yet the evidence is such that I can scarcely doubt.We met in the
sun-kissed hills of Granada; and we loved.Her old nurse was
Argus-eyed; and our meetings were such as only lovers can effect.I
was young, wild, and my blood coursed like a torrent through my veins!But I loved her, yes, base though I was, I loved her.And in these
years since I left her in that little house in Bogota, I have suffered
the agonies of the lost when her memory and my own iniquity fell upon
me and smote me sore--

"We were married in Spain, and the marriage was performed by Padre
Rafael de Rincon.""I was rich; I was roaming the
world, extending my vast business interests; and I took her to
Colombia, where I labored with the politicians in Bogota to grant me
timber and cattle concessions.We had a cottage on the outskirts of
the city, where we were happy.With us lived her faithful old nurse,
whom she would not leave in Spain--

"Then, one day, came a cable message that my father had died.I knew I must return at once to New York.But--I would
not take a wife back with me!And I kissed
her tear-stained face, and bade her wait, for I would return and make
her happy.And then--

"Months later I wrote to her, and, receiving no reply, I caused
inquiry to be made.But she had gone--whither, no one knew.The old
nurse, too, had disappeared.I never learned that a woman had been
left at Badillo to die.She was
timid, and went out seldom.And then--then I thought that a marriage
here would strengthen my position, for I was powerful and proud."Oh, the years that her sad face haunted me!I know
not why, but when the _Cossack_ was built I had her portrait in glass
set in the smoking room.And night after night I have sat before it
and cursed myself, and implored her to forgive!"I was Guillermo to her, and she Dolores to me.Had Carmen ever worn it in my presence I
must have recognized it at once."But," said Ames, choking down his sorrow, "that man is dead.He, like
Goliath, fought Truth, and the Truth fell upon him, crushing him to
powder.The man who remains with you now lives only in this little
girl.And she has brought me my own son, Sidney, and another, Jose.All that I have is theirs, and they will give it to the world.I would
that she could have brought me that noble black man, Rosendo, who laid
down his beautiful life when he saw that his work was done.I learn
from my inquiries that he and Dona Maria lived with Don Nicolas far up
the Boque river during the troublous times when Simiti was burned and
devastated.And that, when the troops had gone, they returned to their
desolated home, and died, within a month of each other.And can my care of their daughter Ana and her little son
ever cancel the debt?"Father, does Jose know that it was Kathleen
whom he rescued from the Tiber in Rome, years ago, and who caused him
to lose his notebook?""No, Sidney,
we had not told him.And how inextricably
bound together we all are!And, Jose, I have not told you that the
woman who lived and died alone in the limestone caves near Honda, and
whose story you had from Don Jorge in Simiti, was doubtless the
faithful old nurse of Dolores.Padre Rafael de Rincon maintained her there."Haynerd entered the room at that moment, and with him came Miss Wall."Now," said Hitt softly, "the circle is complete.Carmen, may I--"

The girl rose at once and went into the music room.Those who remained
sat in awed, expectant silence.Another presence stole softly in, but
they saw him not.Soon through the great rooms and marble halls
drifted the low, weird melody which the girl had sung, long before, in
the dreary Elwin school.In the flickering light of the fire strange shapes took form; and the
shadows that danced on the walls silhouetted scenes from the dimming
past.From out their weird imagery rose a single form.Slowly it rose before them from out the shadows.It was black of face, but its wondrous heart which had cradled the
nameless babe of Badillo glistened like drifting snow.The last sweet notes of the plaintive Indian lament fluttered from the
girl's lips, echoed among the marble pillars, and died away down the
distant corridors.She returned and bent over her father with a tender
caress.Then the great black man in the shadows extended his arms for a moment
above them, and faded from their sight.There was the sound of low
weeping in the room.For

  "these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
  washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
  Lamb."GLOSSARY

Yes!It would be worse than wasted,

in this country every year for tobacco--burned up--wasted--worse than
wasted.Do you think the farmer who planted tobacco instead of corn, did any
good to the world by the change?How does the liquor-drinker spend his money?What could we do, if no money was spent for
          liquor?Tell two ways in which you could burn up a

Obvious punctuation errors repaired.The Executive Council consists of three heads of
departments and six unofficial members of the First Raad.These nine
officials are the authors of all laws, treaties, and policies that are
proposed to the Volksraads, which constitute the third part of the
Government.There are two Volksraads, one similar in purpose to our
Senate, and the other, the second Volksraad, not unlike our House of
Representatives, but with far less power.The first Volksraad consists of twenty-seven members elected from and by
the burghers, or voters, who were born in the country.A naturalized
burgher is ineligible to the upper House.The twenty-seven members of
the Second Raad are naturalized burghers, and are voted for only by men
who have received the franchise.The second House has control of the
management of the Government works, telephones, mails, and mines, and
has but little voice in the real government of the country.Its members
are undoubtedly more progressive and have more modern ideas than those
of the First Raad, and introduce many bills which would be of undoubted
benefit to the country, but the upper House invariably vetoes all bills
that reach them from that Raad.The First Raad receives bills and
suggestions from the Executive Council or from the President himself,
but refers them to a commission for investigation before any action is
taken upon them.The evidence in support of proposed measures does not
reach the Raad, which only concerns itself with the report of the
commission.The Raad can, by motion, make a suggestion to the Executive
Council that a certain measure should be formulated, but the Executive
Council and the President have the authority to ignore the suggestion,
leaving the First Raad without a vestige of authority.The upper House
concerns itself chiefly with the questions of finance, changes in the
Constitution, and the care of the natives.As the question of finance
is so closely connected with almost every subject that comes before the
Government, it follows that the First Raad concerns itself with
practically the entire business of the Government.The popular
conception is that the Second Raad, being composed of naturalized
citizens, takes less interest in the affairs of the country, and can
therefore be less safely trusted with their conduct than the old
burghers and Voortrekkers of the upper House, who would rather declare
war against a foreign power than pass a law in the least unfavourable to
their own country's interests.In consequence of the Second Raad's
infinitesimal powers, almost the entire law-making power of the
Government is vested in the Executive Council and the First Raad.The
First Raad of the Transvaal Republic is the direct successor of the
democratic form of government that was established by the Voortrekkers
of 1835 when they were journeying from Cape Colony to the northern
lands.The Second Raad was established in 1890, in order that the
Uitlanders might have representation in the government of the country.It was believed that the newly arrived population would take advantage
of the opportunities thus offered to take part in the legislation of the
republic, and in that way bridge over the gulf which had been formed
between the two races.The Uitlanders cared little for the privilege
offered to them, and so far in the history of the Second Raad less than
half a score of its members have been elected by the new population.The annual sessions of the Volksraads commence on the first Monday in
May, and continue until all the business of the republic has been
transacted.The members of the two Houses receive fifteen dollars a
day, and seventy-five cents an hour for services extending over more
than the five hours a day required by the law.The chairmen, or
voorzitters, of the Raads receive seventeen dollars and fifty cents a
day, and one dollar an hour for extra time.The sessions of the Raad are held in the new million-dollar Government
House in the central part of the town of Pretoria, and are open to the
public except when executive business is being transacted.The Raad
chambers are exquisitely fitted out with rich furniture and tapestries,
the windows are of costly stained glass, and the walls lavishly
decorated with carved wood and fine paintings of the country's notable
men.On a lofty elevation facing the entrance to the First Raad chamber
is a heavily carved mahogany desk, behind which is seated the chairman.On his right is a seat for the President, while on the right side of
that are the nine chairs for the Executive Council.Directly in front
and beneath the chairman's desk are the desks of the three official
secretaries, and in front of these, in semicircular form, the two rows
of seats and desks of the Raad members.In the rear of the chamber on
either side of the entrance are chairs for visitors, while high in the
left side of the lofty chamber is a small balcony for the newspaper men.All the members of the Raad are obliged by law to wear black clothing
and white neckties.This law was framed to prevent some of the rural
members from appearing in their burgher costumes, and has had the effect
of making of the Boer Raads a most sombre-looking body of lawmakers.Almost all members wear long frock-coats, silk hats, and heavy black
boots, and when, during the recesses, they appear on the piazza of the
Government Building with huge pipes in their mouths, the wisdom of the
black-clothing law is not apparent.There is little formality in the
proceedings of the Raads.Certain rules are necessarily followed, but
the members attack a bill in much the same vehement manner as they would
a lion or a panther.There is little eloquence in the taal, or dialect,
that is spoken in the Raads, and the similes and metaphors bespeak the
open veldt and the transport path rather than the council chamber of a
nation.The black-garbed legislators make no pretensions to dignified procedure,
and when a playful member trips another so that he falls to the floor,
or pelts him with paper balls, the whole Raad joins in laughter.The
gaudily dressed pages--one of them is sixty-five years old and wears a
long beard--are on terms of great familiarity with the members, and have
become mildly famous throughout the country on account of some practical
jokes they have perpetrated upon the members.It is only justice to say
that these light proceedings take place only when the President is not
present.When he arrives in the chamber every one rises and remains
standing until the President has seated himself.He generally takes a
deep interest in the subjects before the House, and not infrequently
speaks at length upon measures for which he desires a certain line of
action.Many of President Kruger's most important speeches have been
delivered to the Raads, and so great is his influence over the members
that his wishes are rarely disregarded.When he meets with opposition
to his views he quickly loses his temper, and upon one occasion called a
certain member who opposed him a traitor, and angrily left the chamber.A short time afterward he returned and apologized to the member and to
the Raad for having in his anger used unseemly language.One of the most disappointing scenes to be observed in Pretoria is the
horde of Uitlander politicians and speculators who are constantly
besieging the Raad members and the Government officials.At probably no
other national capital are the legislators tempted to such a great
extent as are the Boers, who, for the most part, are ignorant of the
ways of the world and unfamiliar with great amounts of money.Every
train from Johannesburg, the Uitlander capital, takes to Pretoria scores
of lobbyists, who use all their powers, both of persuasion and finance,
to influence the minds of the legislators, either in the way of granting
valuable concessions for small considerations or of securing the passage
of bills favourable to the lobbyists.It is no wonder that the
Uitlanders declare that less than one fourth of the Raad members are
unassailably honest and that all the others can be bribed.The Boer
alone is not blameworthy who, having never possessed more than one
hundred dollars at one time, yields to the constant importunities of the
lobbyist and sells his vote for several thousand dollars.Beset by such influences, the Raad members are naturally suspicious of
every bill that is brought before them for consideration.Their
deliberations are marked by a feeling of insecurity akin to that
displayed by the inhabitants of a sheep-pen surrounded by a pack of
hungry wolves.They fear to make a move in any direction lest their
motives be misunderstood, or they play into the hands of the Uitlanders.As a consequence of this external pressure, progress in the improvement
of the methods of governing the country has been slow.One of the
results of the Volksraad's fearfulness is the absence of local
governments throughout the republic.There are no municipalities,
counties, or townships which can formulate and execute local laws.Even
Johannesburg, a city of one hundred thousand population, has no
municipal government, although several attempts have been made to
establish one.The Raads are burdened with the necessity of attending to all the
details which govern the administration of every city, village, hamlet,
and district in the entire country, and the time consumed in doing all
this leaves little for the weightier affairs of state.If a five-dollar
road bridge is required in an out-of-the-way place in the northern part
of the republic, the Raad is obliged to discuss the matter.If an
application for a liquor license comes from a distant point in the
interior, the Raad is compelled to investigate its character before it
can be voted upon.The disadvantages of this system are so evident that
it is hardly conceivable that no remedy has been applied long ago, but
the fear of local mismanagement has prevented the Raad from ridding
itself of this encumbrance upon its time and patience.Every legislature of whatever country has its idiosyncracies, and the
Raad is no exception.Laws are upon the statute books of some of the
American States that are quite as remarkable as some of those made by
the Boer legislators.Bills quite as marvellous have been introduced
and defeated in the legislatures of all countries.The Boer Volksraad
has no monopoly of men with quaint ideas.The examples of Raad
workmanship here given are rare, but true nevertheless:

A man named Dums, whose big farm on the border became British territory
through a treaty, sued the Transvaal Government for damages, whereupon
the Raad passed a law that Dums could never sue the Government for
anything.The High Court sustained the law, and Dums is now a poor
cab-driver in Pretoria.Another man sued the Government for damages for
injuries resulting from a fall in the street.He was successful in his
suit, but the Raad immediately thereafter passed a law making it
impossible for any person to sue the Government for injuries received on
public property.During a severe drought in the Transvaal an American professional
rain-maker asked the Raad for a concession allowing him the exclusive
privilege to precipitate rain by means of explosives in the air.The
Raad had a long and animated discussion on the subject, owing to the
opposition of several of the less enlightened members, who declared that
the project was sacrilegious."It is a sin," they declared, "to poke
your fingers in the Lord's eye to make him weep."The abiding faith
which some of the Raad members have in divine guidance is illustrated by
a discussion that took place in the body shortly after the Jameson raid.One member declared that "the Lord will assist us in this matter if we
will only bide our time," whereupon another member rose and said, "If we
do not soon get down to business and do something without the Lord's
assistance, the Lord will take a holiday and let the Transvaal go to
hell."A law which was in effect for almost two years made it a
misdemeanour for any one to sing "God save the Queen" or "Rule
Britannia" in the country.Mass meetings are prohibited in the
Transvaal, but Germany and other countries with less political foment
have equally stringent regulations on the same subject, so the
Uitlanders' grievance on that account is nullified.Second to that of the Volksraad, the highest power in the Government of
the country is the High Court, which is composed of some of the ablest
jurists in South Africa.From a constitutional standpoint the High
Court has no right or power to review the acts of the Volksraad.The
Constitution of the country gives supreme power to the Volksraad in all
legislative matters, and when a chief justice of the High Court recently
attempted to extend his jurisdiction over the acts of the Volksraad that
body unceremoniously dismissed him.The purpose of that part of the
Constitution which relates to the subjugation of the High Court is to
prevent some influential enemy of the republic from debauching the High
Court and in that way defying the authority of the Volksraad.In a
country which has so many peculiar conditions and circumstances to
contend with, the safety of its institutions depends upon the
centralization of its legislative and administrative branches, and the
wisdom of the early burghers who framed the Constitution so that the
entire governing power lay in the hands of the country's real patriots
has been amply demonstrated upon several occasions.The civil and criminal laws of the country are administered throughout
the different political divisions by local magistrates, called
land-drosts, who also collect the revenues of the district and inform
the Volksraad of the needs of the people under their jurisdiction.The
land-drost is the prototype of the old-time American country squire, in
that he settles disputes, awards damages, and conducts official business
generally.In the majority of cases the land-drosts are aged persons
who have the respect and esteem of the members of the community in which
they dwell and to whom they bear the relation of fatherly advisers in
all things.In Johannesburg and Pretoria the land-drosts are men of
eminent station in the legal profession of South Africa, and are drawn
from all parts of the country, regardless of their political or racial
qualifications.All the court proceedings are conducted in the Dutch
language, and none but Dutch-speaking lawyers are admitted to practise
before the bar.The law of the land is Holland-Roman.The military branch of the Government is undoubtedly the best and most
effective because it is the simplest.It is almost primitive in its
simplicity, yet for effectiveness its superior is not easily found.The
Transvaal glories in its army, and, as every man between the ages of
sixteen and sixty is a nominal member of the army, nothing is left
undone to make it worthy of its glory.The standing army of the
republic numbers less than two hundred men, and these are not always
actively engaged.A detachment of about twenty soldiers is generally on
duty in the vicinity of the Government House at Pretoria, and the others
are stationed at the different forts throughout the republic.The real
army of the Transvaal, however, is composed of the volunteer soldiers,
who can be mobilized with remarkable facility.The head of the army is the commandant-general, who has his headquarters
in Pretoria.He is under the immediate jurisdiction of the Volksraad and
the President, who have the power to declare war and direct its conduct.Second in authority to the commandant-general are the commandants,
permanent officials who have charge of the military affairs of the
seventeen districts of the republic.Under the old South African
burgher law each commandant in any emergency "commandeers" a certain
portion of men from his district.The various districts are subdivided into divisions in charge of
field-cornets and assistant field-cornets.As soon as the
commandant-general issues an order for the mobilization of the volunteer
army the commandants and their assistants, the field-cornets, speedily
go from one house to another in their districts and summon the burghers
from their homes.When the burgher receives the call, he provides his
own gun, horse, and forage, and hastens to the district rendezvous,
where he places himself under the orders of the field-cornet.After all
the burghers of the district have gathered together, the body proceeds
into an adjoining district, where it joins the forces that have been
similarly mobilized there.As a certain number of districts are obliged
to join their forces at a defined locality, the forces of the republic
are consequently divided into different army divisions under the
supervisions of the commandants.In the event that Pretoria were threatened with attack, the order would
be given to move all the forces to that city.The districts on the
border would gather their men and march toward Pretoria, carrying with
them all the forces of the districts through which they were obliged to
pass.So simple and perfect is the system that within forty-eight hours
after the call is issued by the commandant-general four army divisions,
representing the districts in the four quarters of the republic and
consisting of all the able-bodied men in the country, can be mobilized
on the outskirts of Pretoria.It is doubtful whether there is another
nation on earth that can gather its entire fighting strength at its seat
of government in such a brief time.The Transvaal Boer is constantly prepared for the call to arms.He has
his own rifle and ammunition at his home, and when the call comes he
need only bridle his horse--if he is so fortunate as to possess an
animal so rare in the Transvaal--stuff several pounds of biltong, or
dried beef, in his pockets, and commence the march over the veldt to the
district rendezvous.He can depend upon his wife and children to care
for the flocks and herds; but if the impending danger appears to be
great, the cattle are deserted and the women and children are taken to a
rendezvous specially planned for such an emergency.If there is a need,
the Boer woman will stand side by side with her husband or her brother
or her sweetheart, and will allow no one to surpass her in repelling the
attacks of the enemy.Joan of Arcs have been as numerous in the Boer
armies as they have been unheralded.The head of the military branch of the Transvaal Government for many
years has been Commandant-General P. J. Joubert, who, following
President Kruger, is the ablest as well as the most popular Boer in
South Africa.General Joubert is the best type of the Boer fighter in
the country, and as he represents the army, he has always been a
favourite with the class which would rather decide a disputed point by
means of the rifle than by diplomacy, as practised by President Kruger.General Joubert, although the head of the army, is not of a quarrelsome
disposition, and he too believes in the peaceful arbitration of
differences rather than a resort to arms.By the Uitlanders he is
considered to be the most liberal Boer in the republic, and he has upon
numerous occasions shown that he would treat the newcomers in the
country with more leniency than the Kruger Government if he were in
power.In his capacity of Vice-President of the republic he has been as
impotent as the Vice-President is in the United States, but his
influence has always been wielded with a view of harmonizing the
differences of the native and alien populations.Twice the more liberal
and progressive party of the Boers has put him forward as a candidate
for the presidency in opposition to Mr.Kruger, and each time he has
been defeated by only a small majority.The younger Boers who have come
in touch with the more modern civilization have steadfastly supported
General Joubert, while the older Boers, who are ever fearful that any
one but Mr.Kruger would grant too many concessions to the Uitlanders,
have wielded their influence against him.Concerning the franchise for
Uitlanders, General Joubert is more liberal than President Kruger, who
holds that the stability of the Government depends upon the
exclusiveness of the franchise privilege.General Joubert believes that
there are many persons among the Uitlanders who have a real desire to
become citizens of the republic and to take part in the government.He
believes that an intending burgher should take an oath of fidelity, and
afterward be prepared to do what he can for the country, either in peace
or war.If after three or four years the applicant for the franchise
has shown that he worked in the interests of the country and obeyed its
laws, General Joubert believes that the Uitlander should enjoy all the
privileges that a native burgher enjoys--namely, voting for the
candidates for the presidency and the First Volksraad.General Joubert's name has been connected with Transvaal history almost
as long and as prominently as that of President Kruger.The two men are
virtually the fathers of the Boer republic.General Joubert has always
been the man who fought the battles with armies, while Mr.Kruger
conducted the diplomatic battles, and both were equally successful in
their parts.General Joubert, as a youth among the early trekkers from
Natal, was reared amid warfare.During the Transvaal's early battles
with the natives he was a volunteer soldier under the then
Commandant-General Kruger, and later, when the war of independence was
fought, he became General Joubert.He commanded the forces which fought
the battles of Laing's Nek, Bronkhorst Spruit, and Majuba Hill, and he
was one of the triumvirate that conducted the affairs of the Government
during that crucial time.He has been Vice-President of the republic
since the independence of the country has been re-established, and
conducted the affairs of the army during the time when Jameson's
troopers threatened the safety of the country.He has had a notable
career in the service of his country, and as a reward for his services
he is deserving of nothing less than the presidency of the republic
after Mr.Kruger's life-work is ended.General Joubert is no less distinguished as a diplomatist among his
countrymen than President Kruger, and many stories are current in
Pretoria showing that he has been able to accomplish many things wherein
Mr.An incident which occurred immediately after the
Jameson raid, and which is repeated here exactly as related by one of
the participants of the affair, is illustrative of General Joubert and
his methods of dealing with his own people.The story is given in
almost the exact language of the narrator who was the eyewitness:

"Shortly after Jameson and his officers were brought to Pretoria,
President Kruger called about twenty of the Boer commanders to his house
for a consultation.The townspeople were highly excited, and the
presence of the men who had tried to destroy the republic aggravated
their condition so that there were few calm minds in the capital.President Kruger was deeply affected by the seriousness of the events of
the days before, but counselled all those present to be calm.There
were some in the gathering who advised that Jameson and his men should
be shot immediately, while one man jocosely remarked that they should
not be treated so leniently, and suggested that a way to make them
suffer would be to cut off their ears."One of the men who was obliged to leave the meeting gave this account
to the waiting throngs in the street, and a few hours afterward the
cable had carried the news to Europe and America, with the result that
the Boers were called brutal and inhuman.President Kruger used all his
influence and eloquence to save the lives of the prisoners, and for a
long time he was unsuccessful in securing the smallest amount of
sympathy for Jameson and his men.It was dawn when General Joubert was
won to the President's way of thinking, and he continued the argument in
behalf of the prisoners."'My friends, I will ask you to listen patiently to me for several
minutes,' he commenced.'I will tell you the story of the farmer and
the neighbour's dog.Suppose that near your farm lives a man whose
valuable dogs attack your sheep and kill many.Will you shoot the dogs
as soon as you see them, and in that way make yourself liable for
damages greater than the value of the sheep that were destroyed?Or
will you catch the dogs when you are able to do so and, carrying them to
your neighbour, say to him: "I have caught your dogs; now pay me for the
damage they have done me, and they shall be returned to you."'"After a moment's silence General Joubert's face lighted up joyfully,
and he exclaimed:

"'We have the neighbour's dogs in the jail."The parable was effective, and the council of war decided almost
instantly to deliver the prisoners to the British Government."CHAPTER IX

                   CAUSES OF THE PRESENT DISSENSIONS


The politicians and the speculators have been the bane of South Africa.Ill-informed secretaries of the British Colonial Office might augment
the list, but their stupidity in treating with colonial grievances is so
proverbial as to admit them to the rank of natural or providential
causes of dissension.Until the Boer Government came into the
foreground, the politicians and speculators used South Africa as a huge
chessboard, whereon they could manipulate the political and commercial
affairs of hundreds of thousands of persons to suit their own fancies
and convenience.It was a dilettante politician who operated in South Africa and could
not make a cat's-paw of the colonial secretary in Downing Street, and it
was a stupid speculator who was unable to be the power behind the
enthroned politician.Hundreds of
men have gone to South Africa and have become millionaires, but
thousands remain in the country praying for money wherewith to return
home.The former are the politicians and the speculators; the latter
are the miners, the workingmen, and the tradespeople.It is a country where the man with a million becomes a multimillionaire,
and the man with hundreds becomes penniless.It is the wealthy man's
footstool and the poor man's cemetery.Men go there to acquire riches;
few go there to assist in making it tenable for white men.Thousands go
there with the avowed intention of making their fortunes and then to
return.Those who go there as came the immigrants to America--to settle
and develop the new country--can be counted only by the score.Of the
million white people south of the Zambezi, probably one half are mere
fortune-seekers, who would leave the country the very instant they
secured a moderate fortune.These have the welfare of the country at heart only in so far as it
interferes or assists them in attaining their desired goal.They would
ask that Portugal be allowed to rule all of South Africa if they
received the assurance that the much-sought-after fortune could be
secured six months sooner.They have no conscience other than that
which prevents them from stabbing a man to relieve him of his money.They go to the gold and diamond fields to secure wealth, and not to
assist in developing law and order, good government, or good
institutions.The other half of the white population is composed of men and women who
were born in the country--Afrikanders, Dutch, Boers, and other racial
representatives, and others who have emigrated thither from the densely
populated countries of Europe, with the intention of remaining in the
country and taking part in its government and institutions.These
classes comprise the South Africans, who love their country and take a
real interest in its development and progress.They know its needs and
prospects, and are abundantly able to conduct its government so that it
will benefit Boer, Englishman, Dutchman, Natalian, and native.The defects in the Government of Cape Colony and Natal are the natural
results of the handicaps that have been placed on the local legislation
by the Colonial Office in London, who are as ignorant of the real
conditions of their colonies as a Zulu chieftain is of the political
situation in England.The colonial papers teem with letters from
residents who express their indignation at the methods employed by the
Colonial Office in dealing with colonial affairs.Especially is this
the case in Natal, the Eden of South Africa, where the dealings of the
Colonial Office with regard to the Zulus have been stupidly carried on.South African men of affairs who are not bigoted do not hesitate to
express their opinion that Cape Colony and Natal have been retarded a
quarter of a century in their natural growth by the handicap of the
Colonial Office.Their opinion is based upon the fact that every war,
with the exception of several native outbreaks, has been caused by
blundering in the Colonial Office, and that all the wars have retarded
the natural growth and development of the colonies to an aggregate of
twenty-five years.In this estimate is not included the great harm to
industries that has been caused by the score or more of heavy war clouds
with which the country has been darkened during the last half century.These being some of the difficulties with which the two British colonies
in South Africa are beset, it can be readily inferred to what extent the
Boers of the Transvaal have had cause for grievance.In their dealings
with the Boers the British have invariably assumed the role of
aristocrats, and have looked upon and treated the "trekkers" as
_sans-culottes_.[Illustration: Cape Colony Government House, at Cape Town.]This natural antipathy of one race for another has given glorious
opportunities for strife, and neither one nor the other has ever failed
to take quick advantage.The struggle between the Boers and the British
began in Cape Colony almost one hundred years ago, and it has continued,
with varying degrees of bitterness, until the present day.The recent
disturbances in the Transvaal affairs date from the conclusion of the
war of independence in 1881.When the Peace Commissioners met there was
inserted in the treaty one small clause which gave to England her only
right to interfere in the political affairs of the Transvaal.The Boer country at that time was considered of such little worth that
Gladstone declared it was not of sufficient value to be honoured with a
place under the British flag.To the vast majority of the British
people it was a matter of indifference whether the Transvaal was an
independent country or a dependency of their own Government.The clause
which was allowed to enter the treaty unnoticed, and which during recent
years has figured so prominently in the discussions of South African
affairs, reads:

"The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engagement with
any state or nation other than the Orange Free State, nor with any
native tribe to the eastward or the westward of the republic, until the
same has been approved by her Majesty the Queen.Such approval shall be
considered to have been granted if her Majesty's Government shall not,
within six months after receiving a copy of such treaty (which shall be
delivered to them immediately upon its completion), have notified that
the conclusion of the treaty is in conflict with the interests of Great
Britain, or of any of her Majesty's possessions in South Africa."When the contents of the treaty were published to the Boer people, many
of them objected strongly to this clause, and insisted that it gave the
British too great power in the affairs of the republic, and a strenuous
effort was made to have the offending clause eliminated.In the year
1883 a deputation, which included Paul Kruger, was sent to London, with
a view of obtaining the abolition of the suzerainty.This deputation
negotiated a new convention the following year, from which the word
"suzerainty" and the stipulations in regard thereto were removed.In
their report to the Volksraad, made in 1884, the deputation stated that
the new convention put an end to the British suzerainty.February 4, 1884, in a letter to Lord Derby, then in charge of British
affairs, the deputation announced to him that they expected an agreement
to be contained in the treaty relative to the abolition of the
suzerainty.In his reply of a week later, Lord Derby made a statement
upon which the Boers base their strongest claim that the suzerainty was
abolished.He said:

"By the omission of those articles of the convention of Pretoria which
assigned to her Majesty and to the British resident certain specific
powers and functions connected with the internal government and the
foreign relations of the Transvaal state, your Government will be left
free to govern the country without interference, and to conduct its
diplomatic intercourse and shape its foreign policy, subject only to the
requirement embodied in the fourth article of the new draft, that any
treaty with a foreign state shall not have effect without the approval
of the Queen."For a period of almost ten years the suzerainty of England over the
Transvaal was an unknown quantity.With the exception of several
Government officials, there were hardly any Englishmen in the country,
and no one had the slightest interest in the affairs of the Transvaal
Government.When gold was discovered in the Randt in quantities that
equalled those of the early days of the California gold fields, an
unparalleled influx of Englishmen and foreigners followed, and in
several years the city of Johannesburg had sprung up in the veldt.The opening of hundreds of mines, and the consequent increase in
expenditures, made it necessary for the Transvaal Government to increase
its revenues.Mining laws had to be formulated, new offices had to be
created, hundreds of new officials had to be appointed, and all this
required the expenditure of more money in one year than the Government
had spent in a decade before the opening of the mines.The Government
found itself in a quandary, and it solved the problem of finances as
many a stronger and wealthier government has done.Concessions were granted to dynamite, railway, electric light, electric
railway, water, and many other companies, and these furnished to the
Government the nucleus upon which depended its financial existence.Few
of the concessions were obtained by British subjects, and when the
monopolies took advantage of their opportunities, and raised the price
of dynamite and the rates for carrying freight, the Englishmen, who
owned all the mines, naturally objected.The Boer Government, having
bound itself hand and foot when hard pressed for money, was unable to
compel the concessionaries to reduce their rates.At that period of the Randt's existence the speculators appeared, and
soon thereafter the London Stock Exchange became a factor in the affairs
of the Randt.Where the Stock Exchange leads, the politicians follow,
and they too soon became interested in South African affairs.Then the
treaty of 1883 was found in the Colonial Office archives, and next
appears a demand to the Boer Government that all British residents of
the Transvaal be allowed to vote.The Boers refused to give the
franchise to any applicant unless he first renounced his allegiance to
other countries, and, as the British subjects declined to accede to the
request, the politicians became busily engaged in formulating other
plans whereby England might obtain control of the country.At that inopportune time Jameson's troopers entered the Transvaal
territory and attempted to take forcible possession of the country; but
they were unsuccessful, and only succeeded in directing the world's
sympathy to the Boers.The Jameson raid was practically Cecil J.
Rhodes's first important attempt to add the Transvaal to the list of
South African additions he has made to the British Empire.The result
was especially galling to him, as it was the first time his great
political schemes failed of success.But Rhodes is not the man to weep over disasters.Before the excitement
over the raid had subsided, Rhodes had concocted a plan to inflict a
commercial death upon the Transvaal, and in that manner force it to beg
for the protection of the English flag.He opened Rhodesia, an
adjoining country, for settlement, and by glorifying the country, its
mineral and agricultural wealth, and by offering golden inducements to
Transvaal tradespeople, miners, and even Transvaal subjects, he hoped to
cause such an efflux from the Transvaal that the Government would be
embarrassed in less than two years.The country which bears his name
was found to be amazingly free from mountains of gold and rivers of
honey, and the several thousand persons who had faith in his alluring
promises remained in Rhodesia less than a year, and then returned to the
Transvaal.The reports of the Rhodesian country that were brought back by the
disappointed miners and settlers were not flattering to the condition of
the country or the justice of the Government.Of two evils, they chose
the lesser, and again placed themselves under the Kruger Government.When revolution and enticement failed to bring the Transvaal under the
British flag, Rhodes inaugurated a political propaganda.His last
resort was the Colonial Office in London, and in that alone lay the only
course by which he could attain his object.Again the franchise question was resorted to as the ground of the
contention, the dynamite and railway subjects having been so thoroughly
debated as to be as void of ground for further contention as they had
always been foreign to British control or interference.The question of
granting the right of voting to the Uitlanders in the Transvaal is one
which so vitally affects the future life of the Government that the
Boers' concession of that right would be tantamount to presenting the
country to the British Government.of the Uitlanders of the Transvaal are no more
than transient citizens.They were attracted thither by the gold mines
and the attendant industries, and they have no thought of staying in the
Transvaal a minute after they have amassed a fortune or a competency.Under no consideration would they remain in the country for the rest of
their lives, because the climate and nature of the country are not
conducive to a desire for long residence.It has been demonstrated that
less than one per cent.of the Uitlanders had sufficient interest in the
country to pass through the formality of securing naturalization papers
preparatory to becoming eligible for the franchise.The Boer Government has offered that all Uitlanders of nine years'
residence, having certain unimportant qualifications, should be
enfranchised in two years, and that others should be enfranchised in
seven years--two years for naturalization and five more years'
resident--before acquiring the right to vote.There is a provision for a property qualification, which makes it
necessary for the naturalized citizen to own a house of no less value
than two hundred and fifty dollars in renting value, or an income of one
thousand dollars.The residence clause in the Transvaal qualifications
compares favourably with those of London, where an Englishman from any
part of the country and settling in the municipality is obliged to live
two years and have certain property qualifications before acquiring the
right of franchise.In full knowledge of these conditions the Uitlanders insist upon having
an unconditional franchise--one that will require nothing more than a
two-years' residence in the country.The Boers are well aware of the
results that would follow the granting of the concessions demanded, but
not better so than the Uitlanders who make the demands.The latest
Transvaal statistics place the number of Boer burghers in the country at
less than thirty thousand.At the lowest estimate there are in the
Transvaal fifty thousand Uitlanders having the required qualifications,
and all of these would become voters in two years.At the first
election held after the two years had elapsed the Uitlanders would be
victorious, and those whom they elected would control the machinery of
the Government.The Uitlanders' plan is as transparent as air, yet it
has the approval and sanction of the English politicians, press, and
public.The propaganda which Rhodes and other politicians and stock brokers
interested in the Transvaal gold mines inaugurated a short time after
the Jameson raid has been successful in arousing the people in England
to what they have been led to believe is a situation unequalled in the
history of the empire-building.At the
same time the British Parliament was discussing the subject of the
alleged injustice under which the English residents of the Transvaal
were suffering, the colonial secretary was engaged in disposing of
grievances which reached him from the Dutch residents of British Guiana,
in South America, and which recited conditions parallel to those
complained of by the Uitlanders.The grievances were made by foreign
residents of English territory, instead of by English subjects in a
foreign country, and consequently demanded less serious attention, but
their justice was none the less patent.The three thousand native Dutch
voters in British Guiana have no voice in the legislative or
administrative branches of the colonial government, owing to the
peculiar laws which give to the three thousand British-born citizens the
complete control of the franchise.The population of the colony is
three hundred thousand, yet the three thousand British subjects make and
administer the laws for the other two hundred and ninety-seven thousand
inhabitants, who compose the mining and agricultural communities and are
treated with the same British contempt as the Boers.The Dutch
residents have made many appeals for a fuller representation in the
Government, but no reforms have been inaugurated or promised.The few grievances which the Uitlanders had before the Jameson raid have
been multiplied a hundredfold and no epithet is too venomous for them to
apply to the Boers.The letters in the home newspapers have allied the
name of the Boers with every vilifying adjective in the English
dictionary, and returning politicians have never failed to supply the
others that do not appear in the book.Petitions with thousands of names, some real, but many non-existent,
have been forwarded to the Colonial Office and to every other office in
London where they would be received, and these have recited grievances
that even the patient Boer Volksraad had never heard about.It has been
a propaganda of petitions and letters the like of which has no parallel
in the history of politics.It has been successful in arousing
sentiment favourable to the Uitlanders, and at this time there is hardly
a handful of persons in England who are not willing to testify to the
utter degradation of the Boers.Another branch of the propaganda operated through the Stock Exchange,
and its results were probably more practical than those of the literary
branch.It is easier to reach the English masses through the Stock
Exchange than by any other means.Whenever one of the "Kaffir" or
Transvaal companies failed to make both ends meet in a manner which
pleased the stockholders, it was only necessary to blame the Boer
Government for having impeded the digging of gold, and the stockholders
promptly outlined to the Colonial Office the policy it should pursue
toward the Boers.The impressions that are formed in watching the tide of events in the
Transvaal are that the Boer Government is not greatly inferior to the
Government of Lord Salisbury and Secretary Chamberlain.The only
appreciable difference between the two is that the Boers are fighting
the cause of the masses against the classes, while the English are
fighting that of the classes against the masses.In England, where the
rich have the power, the poor pay the taxes, while in the Transvaal the
poor have the power and compel the rich to pay the taxes.If the
Transvaal taxes were of such serious proportions as to be almost
unbearable, there might be a cause for interference by the Uitlander
capitalists who own the mines, but there no injustice is shown to any
one.The only taxes that the Uitlanders are compelled to pay are the
annual poll tax of less than four dollars and a half, mining taxes of a
dollar and a quarter a month for each claim for prospecting licenses,
and five dollars a claim for diggers' licenses.Boer and Uitlander are
compelled to pay these taxes without distinction.The Boers, in this contention, must win or die.In earlier days, before
every inch of African soil was under the flag of one country or another,
they were able to escape from English injustice by loading their few
possessions on wagons and "trekking" into new and unexplored lands.If
they yield their country to the English without a struggle, they will be
forced to live under a future Stock Exchange Government, which has been
described by a member of the British Parliament as likely to be "the
vilest, the most corrupt, and the most pernicious known to man."[#]


[#] The Hon.Henry Labouchere, in London Truth.The Boers have no better argument to advance in support of their claim
than that which is contained in the Transvaal national hymn.It at once
gives a history of their country, its many struggles and
disappointments, and its hopes.It is written in the "taal" of the
country, and when sung by the patriotic, deep-voiced Boers is one of the
most impressive hymns that ever inspired a nation.The four-colours of our dear old land
      Again float o'er Transvaal,
    And woe the God-forgetting hand
      That down our flag would haul!Wave higher now in clearer sky
      Our Transvaal freedom's stay!Our enemies with fright did fly;
      Now dawns a glorious day.Through many a storm ye bravely stood,
      And we stood likewise true;
    Now, that the storm is o'er, we would
      Leave nevermore from you
    Bestormed by Kaffir, Lion, Brit,
      Wave ever o'er their head;
    And then to spite we hoist thee yet
      Up to the topmost stead!Four long years did we beg--aye, pray--
      To keep our lands clear, free,
    We asked you, Brit, we loath the fray:
      "Go hence, and let us be!We've waited, Brit, we love you not,
      To arms we call the Boer;"
        (Lit., Now take we to our guns.)"You've teased us long enough, we troth,
      Now wait we nevermore."And with God's help we cast the yoke
      Of England from our knee;
    Our country safe--behold and look--
      Once more our flag waves free!Though many a hero's blood it cost,
      May all the nations see
        (Lit., Though England ever so much more.)That God the Lord redeemed our hosts;
      The glory his shall be.Wave high now o'er our dear old land,
      Wave four-colours of Transvaal!And woe the God-forgetting hand
      That dares you down to haul!Wave higher now in clearer sky
      Our Transvaal freedom's stay!Our enemies with fright did fly;
      Now dawns a glorious day.CHAPTER X

                        PREPARATIONS FOR DEFENCE


Ever since the Jameson raid both the Boers and the Uitlanders have
realized that a peaceful solution of the differences between the two is
possible but highly improbable.The Uitlanders refused to concede
anything to the Boer, and asked for concessions that implied a virtual
abandonment of their country to the English, whom they have always
detested.The Boers themselves have not been unmindful of the
inevitable war with their powerful antagonist, and, not unlike the tiny
ant of the African desert, which fortifies its abode against the
anticipated attack of wild beasts, have made of their country a
veritable arsenal.Probably no inland country in the world is half so well prepared for war
at any time as that little Government, which can boast of having less
than thirty thousand voters.The military preparation has been so
enormous that Great Britain has been compelled, according to the
colonial secretary's statement to the British Parliament, to expend two
and a half million dollars annually in South Africa in order to keep
pace with the Boers.Four years ago, when the Transvaal Government
learned that the Uitlanders of Johannesburg were planning a revolution,
it commenced the military preparations which have ever since continued
with unabating vigour.German experts were employed to formulate plans
for the defence of the country, and European artillerists were secured
to teach the arts of modern warfare to the men at the head of the Boer
army.Several Americans of military training became the instructors in
the national military school at Pretoria; and even the women and
children became imbued with the necessity of warlike preparation, and
learned the use of arms.Several million pounds were annually spent in
Europe in the purchase of the armament required by the plans formulated
by the experts, and the whole country was placed on a war footing.Every important strategic position was made as impregnable as modern
skill and arms could make it, and every farmer's cottage was supplied
with arms and ammunition, so that the volunteer army might be mobilized
in a day.In order to demonstrate the extent to which the military preparation has
been carried, it is only necessary to give an account of the defences of
Pretoria and Johannesburg, the two principal cities of the country.Pretoria, being the capital, and naturally the chief point of attack by
the enemy, has been prepared to resist the onslaught of any number of
men, and is in a condition to withstand a siege of three years.The
city lies in the centre of a square, at each corner of which is a lofty
hill surmounted by a strong fort, which commands the valleys and the
surrounding country.Each of the four forts has four heavy cannon, four
French guns of fifteen miles range, and thirty heavy Gatling guns.Besides this extraordinary protection, the city has fifty light Gatling
guns which can be drawn by mules to any point on the hills where an
attack may be made.Three large warehouses are filled with ammunition,
and the large armory is packed to the eaves with Mauser, Martini-Henry,
and Wesley-Richards rifles.Two extensive refrigerators, with a
capacity of two thousand oxen each, are ample provision against a siege
of many months.It is difficult to compute the total expenditures for
war material by the Boer Government during the last four years, but the
following official announcement of expenses for one year will serve to
give an idea of the vastness of the preparations that the Government has
been compelled to make in order to guard the safety of the country:

    War-Office salaries .$262,310
    War purposes.4,717,550
    Johannesburg revolt .800,000
    Public works.3,650,000
                                           ----------
                                           $9,429,860


Johannesburg has extensive fortifications around it, but the Boers will
use them for other purposes than those of self-protection.The forts at
the Golden City were erected for the purpose of quelling any revolution
of the Uitlanders, who constitute almost entirely the population of the
city.One of the forts is situated on a small eminence about half a mile north
of the business part, and commands the entire city with its guns.Two
years were consumed in building the fortification and in placing the
armament in position.Its guns can rake not only every street of the
city, but ten of the principal mine works as well, and the damage that
their fire could cause is incalculable.Another fort, almost as strong
as the one in Johannesburg, is situated a mile east of the city, and
overshadows the railway and the principal highway to Johannesburg.The
residents of the city are greatly in fear of underground works, which
they have been led to believe were constructed since the raid.Vast
quantities of earth were taken out of the Johannesburg fort, and for
such a length of time did the work continue that the Uitlanders decided
that the Boers were undermining the city, and protested to the
Government against such a course.As soon as war is declared and the
women and children have been removed from the city, Johannesburg will be
rent with shot and shell.The Boers have announced their intention of
doing this, and the Uitlanders, anticipating it, seek safety in flight
whenever there are rumours of war, as thousands did immediately before
and after the Jameson affair.The approaches to the mountain passes on the border have been fortified
with vast quantities of German and French ordnance, and equipped with
garrisons of men born or trained in Europe.The approaches to Laing's
Nek, near the Natal border, which have several times been the battle
ground of the English and Boer forces, have been prepared to resist an
invading army from Natal.Much attention has been directed to the
preparations in that part of the republic, because the British
commanders will find it easier to transfer forces from the port of
Durban, which is three hundred and six miles from the Transvaal border,
while Cape Town is almost a thousand miles distant.But the Pretorian Government has made many provisions for war other than
those enumerated.It has made alliances and friends that will be of
equal worth in the event of an attack by England.The Orange Free
State, whose existence is as gravely imperilled as that of the
Transvaal, will fight hand-in-hand with its neighbour, just as it was
prepared to do at the time of the Jameson raid, when almost every Free
State burgher lay armed on the south bank of the Vaal River, awaiting
the summons for assistance from the Kruger Government.In the event of
war the two Governments will be as one, and, in anticipation of the
struggle of the Boers against the British, the Free State Government has
been expending vast sums of money every year in strengthening the
country's defences.At the same time that the Free State is being
prepared for war, its Government officials are striving hard to prevent
a conflict, and are attempting to conciliate the two principals in the
strife by suggesting that concessions be made by both.The Free State
is not so populous as the Transvaal, and consequently can not place as
many men in the field, but the ten thousand burghers who will answer the
call to arms will be an acceptable addition to the Boer forces.The element of doubt enters into the question of what the Boers and
their co-religionists of Cape Colony and Natal will do in the event of
war.The Dutch of Cape Colony are the majority of the population, and,
although loyal British subjects under ordinary circumstances, are
opposed to English interference in the Transvaal's affairs.Those of
Natal, while not so great in numbers, are equally friendly with the
Transvaal Boers, and would undoubtedly recall some of their old
grievances against the British Government as sufficient reason to join
the Boers in war.In Cape Colony there is an organization called the Afrikander Bond which
recently has gained control of the politics of the colony, and which
will undoubtedly be supreme for many years to come.The motto of the
organization is "South Africa for South Africans," and its doctrine is
that South Africa shall be served first and Great Britain afterward.Its members, who are chiefly Dutch, believe their first duty is to
assist the development of the resources of their own country by proper
protective tariffs and stringent legislation in native affairs, and they
regard legislation with a view to British interests as of secondary
importance.The Bond has been very amicably inclined toward its
Afrikander kinsmen in the Transvaal, especially since the Jameson raid,
and every sign of impending trouble between England and the Boers widens
the chasm between the English and Afrikanders of South Africa.The
Dutch approve of President Kruger's course in dealing with the franchise
problems, and if hostilities break out it would be not the least
incompatible with their natures to assist their Transvaal and Free State
kinsmen even at the risk of plunging the whole of South Africa into a
civil war.W. P. Schreiner, the Premier of Cape Colony, is the leading
member of the Bond, and with him he has associated the majority of the
leading men in the colony.Under ordinary conditions their loyalty to
Great Britain is undoubted, but whether they could resist the influence
of their friends in the Bond if it should decide to cast its fortunes
with the Boers in case of war is another matter.Of such vast importance is the continued loyalty of the Dutch of the two
colonies that upon it depends practically the future control of the Cape
by the British Government.Being in the majority as three to two, and
almost in supreme control of the local government, the Dutch of Cape
Colony are in an excellent position to secede from the empire, as they
have already threatened to do, in which event England would be obliged
to fight almost the united population of the whites if she desired to
retain control of the country.With this in mind, it is no wonder that
Mr.Chamberlain declared that England had reached a critical turning
point in the history of the empire.The uncertainty of the situation is increased by the doubtful stand
which the native races are taking in the dispute.Neither England nor
the Boers has the positive assurance of support from any of the tribes,
which outnumber the whites as ten to one; but it will not be an
unwarranted opinion to place the majority of the native tribes on the
side of the Boers.The native races are always eager to be the friends
of the paramount power, and England's many defeats in South Africa
during recent years have not assisted in gaining for it that prestige.When England enters upon a war with the Transvaal the natives will
probably follow the example of the Matabele natives, who rebelled
against the English immediately after Jameson and his men were defeated
by the Boers, because they believed a conquered nation could offer no
resistance.The Boers, having won the last battle, are considered by the
natives to be the paramount power, and it is always an easy matter to
induce a subjected people to ally itself with a supposedly powerful one.The Zulus, still stinging under the defeat which they received from the
British less than twenty years ago, might gather their war parties and,
with the thousands of guns they have been allowed to buy, attempt to
secure revenge.The Basutos, east of the Orange Free State, now the
most powerful and the only undefeated nation in the country, would
hardly allow a war to be fought unless they participated in it, even if
only to demonstrate to the white man that they still retain their
old-time courage and ability.The million and a half natives in Cape
Colony, and the equal number in the Transvaal, have complained of so
many alleged grievances at the hands of their respective governments
that they might be presumed to rise against them, though it is never
possible to determine the trend of the African <DW64>'s mind.What the
various tribes would do in such an emergency can be answered only by the
chiefs themselves, and they will not speak until the time for action is
at hand.Perhaps when that time does arrive there may be a realization
of the natives' dream--that a great leader will come from the north who
will organize all the various tribes into one grand army and with it
drive the hated white men into the sea.It is impossible to secure accurate statistics in regard to the military
strength of the various colonies, states, and tribes in the country, but
the following table gives a fair idea of the number of men who are
liable to military duty:

                              Dutch.Cape Colony               20,000        10,000        177,000
    Natal                      7,000         5,000        100,000
    Orange Free State         10,000       ......         30,000
    Transvaal                 30,000        20,000        140,000
    Rhodesia                 ......         2,000         25,000
    Swaziland and Basutoland ......       ......         30,000
                              ------        ------        -------
    Total                     67,000        37,000        570,000


To him who delights in forming possible coalitions and war situations
this table offers vast opportunities.Probably no other country can
offer such a vast number of possibilities for compacts between nations,
races, and tribes as is presented in South Africa.There all the
natives may unite against the whites, or a part of them against a part
of the whites, while whites and natives may unite against a similar
combination.The possibilities are boundless; the probabilities are
uncertain.The Pretorian Government has had an extensive secret service for several
years, and this has been of inestimable value in securing the support of
the natives as well as the friendship of many whites, both in South
Africa and abroad.The several thousand Irishmen in South Africa have
been organized into a secret compact, and have been and will continue to
be of great value to the Boers.The head of the organization is a man
who is one of President Kruger's best friends, and his lieutenants are
working even as far away as America.The sympathy of the majority of
the Americans in the Transvaal is with the Boer cause, and, although the
American consul-general at Cape Town has cautioned them to remain
neutral, they will not stand idly by and watch the defeat of a cause
which they believe to be as just as that for which their forefathers
fought at Bunker Hill and Lexington.But the Boers do not rely upon external assistance to win their battles
for them.When it becomes necessary to defend their liberty and their
country they reverently place their trust in Providence and their
rifles.Their forefathers' battles were won with such confidence, and
the later generations have been similarly successful under like
conditions.The rifle is the young Boer's primer and the grandfather's
testament.It is the Boers' avenger of wrong and the upholder of right.That their confidence in their rifles has not been misapplied has been
demonstrated at Laing's Nek, Majuba Hill, Doornkop, and in battles with
natives.The natural opportunities provided by Nature which in former years were
responsible for the confidence which the Boers reposed in their rifles
may have disappeared with the approach of advancing civilization, but
the Boer of to-day is as dangerous an adversary with a gun as his father
was in the wars with the Zulus and the Matabeles half a century ago.The
buck, rhinoceros, elephant, and hippopotamus are not as numerous now as
then, but the Boer has devised other means by which he may perfect
himself in marksmanship.Shooting is one of the main diversions of the
Boer, and prizes are offered for the best results in contests.It is
customary to mark out a ring, about two hundred and fifty feet in
diameter, in the centre of which a small stuffed figure resembling a
bird is attached to a pole.The marksmen stand on the outside of the
circle and fire in turn at the target.A more curious target, and one
that taxes the ability of the marksman, is in more general use
throughout the country.A hole sufficiently deep to retain a
turkey-cock is dug in a level plot of ground, and over this is placed a
piece of canvas which contains a small hole through which the bird can
extend and withdraw its head.At a distance of three hundred feet the
bird's head is a target by no means easily hit.Military men are accustomed to sneer at the lack of generalship of the
Boer forces, but in only one of the battles in which they have engaged
the British forces have the trained military men and leaders been able
to cope with them.In the battle of Boomplaats, fought in 1848, the
English officers can claim their only victory over the Boers, who were
armed with flintlocks, while the British forces had heavy artillery.In
almost all the encounters that have taken place the Boer forces were not
as large as those of the enemy, yet the records show that many more
casualties were inflicted than received by them.In the chief
engagements the appended statistics show that the Boers had only a small
percentage of their men in the casualty list, while the British losses
were much greater.Laing's Nek           400        550          190         24
    Ingogo                300        250          142         17
    Majuba Hill           600        150          280          5
    Bronkhorst            250        300          120          1
    Jameson raid          600        400          100          5


It is hardly fair to assume that the Boers' advantages in these battles
were gained without the assistance of capable generals when it is taken
into consideration that there is a military axiom which places the value
of an army relatively with the ability of its commanders.The Boers may
exaggerate when they assert that one of their soldiers is the equal in
fighting ability of five British soldiers, but the results of the
various battles show that they have some slight foundation for their
theory.The regular British force in South Africa is comparatively small, but it
would require less than a month to transport one hundred thousand
trained soldiers from India and England and place them on the scene of
action.Several regiments of trained soldiers are always stationed in
different parts of the country near the Transvaal border, and at brief
notice they could be placed on Boer territory.Charlestown, Ladysmith,
and Pietermaritzburg, in Natal, have been British military headquarters
for many years, and during the last three years they have been
strengthened by the addition of several regular regiments.The British
Colonial Office has been making preparations for several years for a
conflict.Every point in the country has been strengthened, and all the
foreign powers whose interests in the country might lead them to
interfere in behalf of the Boers have been placated.Germany has been
taken from the British zone of danger by favourable treaties; France is
fearful to try interference alone; and Portugal, the only other nation
interested, is too weak and too deeply in England's debt to raise her
voice against anything that may be done.By leasing the town of Lorenzo Marques from the Portuguese Government,
Great Britain has acquired one of the best strategic points in South
Africa.The lease, the terms of which are unannounced, was the
culmination of much diplomatic dickering, in which the interests of
Germany and the South African Republic were arrayed against those of
England and Portugal.There is no doubt that England made the lease
only in order to gain an advantage over President Kruger, and to prevent
him from further fortifying his country with munitions of war imported
by way of Lorenzo Marques and Delagoa Bay.England gains a commercial
advantage too, but it is hardly likely that she would care to add the
worst fever-hole in Africa to her territory simply to please the few of
her merchants who have business interests in the town.Since the Jameson
raid the Boers have been purchasing vast quantities of guns and
ammunition in Europe for the purpose of preparing themselves for any
similar emergency.Delagoa Bay alone was an open port to the Transvaal,
every other port in South Africa being under English dominion and
consequently closed to the importation of war material.Lorenzo
Marques, the natural port of the Transvaal, is only a short distance
from the eastern border of that country, and is connected with Pretoria
and Johannesburg by a railway.It was over this railway that the Boers
were able to carry the guns and ammunition with which to fortify their
country, and England could not raise a finger to prevent the little
republic from doing as it pleased.Hardly a month has passed since the
raid that the Transvaal authorities did not receive a large consignment
of guns and powder from Germany and France by way of Lorenzo Marques.England could do nothing more than have several detectives at the docks
to take an inventory of the munitions as they passed in transit.The transfer of Lorenzo Marques to the British will put an effectual bar
to any further importation of guns into the Transvaal, and will
practically prevent any foreign assistance from reaching the Boers in
the event of another war.Both Germany and England tried for many years
to induce Portugal to sell Delagoa Bay, but being the debtor of both to
a great extent, the sale could not be made to one without arousing the
enmity of the other.Eighteen or twenty years ago Portugal would have
sold her sovereign right over the port to Mr.Gladstone's Government for
sixty thousand dollars, but that was before Delagoa Bay had any
commercial or political importance.Since then Germany became the
political champion of the Transvaal, and blocked all the schemes of
England to isolate the inland country by cutting off its only neutral
connection with the sea.Recently, however, Germany has been
disappointed by the Transvaal Republic, and one of the results is the
present cordial relations between the Teutons and the Anglo-Saxons in
South African affairs.The English press and people in South Africa have always asserted that
by isolating the Transvaal from the sea the Boers could be starved into
submission in case of a war.As soon as the lease becomes effective, Mr.Kruger's country will be completely surrounded by English territory, at
least in such a way that nothing can be taken into the Transvaal without
first passing through an English port, and no foreign power will be able
to send forces to the aid of the Boers unless they are first landed on
British soil.It is doubtful whether any nation would incur such a
grave responsibility for the sake of securing Boer favour.Both the Transvaal and England are fully prepared for war, and diplomacy
only can postpone its coming.The Uitlanders' present demands may be
conceded, but others that will follow may not fare so well.A coveted
country will always be the object of attacks by a stronger power, and
the aggressor generally succeeds in securing from the weaker victim
whatever he desires.Whether British soldiers will be obliged to fight
the Boers alone in order to gratify the wishes of their Government, or
whether the enemy will be almost the entire white and black population
of South Africa, will not be definitely known until the British troop
ships start for Cape Town and Durban.[Illustration: Cape Town and Table Mountain.]Whichever enemy it will be, the British Government will attack, and will
pursue in no half-hearted or half-prepared manner, as it has done in
previous campaigns in the country.The Boers will be able to resist and
to prolong the campaign to perhaps eight months or a year, but they will
finally be obliterated from among the nations of the earth.It will
cost the British Empire much treasure and many lives, but it will
satisfy those who caused it--the politicians and speculators.CHAPTER XI

                   AMERICAN INTERESTS IN SOUTH AFRICA


An idea of the nature and extent of American enterprise in South Africa
might be deduced from the one example of a Boston book agent, who made a
competency by selling albums of United States scenery to the <DW64>s
along the shores of the Umkomaas River, near Zululand.The book agent
is not an incongruity of the activity of Americans in that part of the
continent, but an example rather of the diversified nature of the
influences which owe their origin to the nation of Yankees ten thousand
miles distant.The United States of America have had a deeper influence
upon South Africa than that which pertains to commerce and trade.The
progress, growth, and prosperity of the American States have instilled
in the minds of the majority of South Africans a desire to be free from
European control, and to be united under a single banner, which is to
bear the insignia of the United States of South Africa.In public, editors and speechmakers in Cape Colony, Natal, and the
Transvaal spend hours in deploring the progress of Americanisms in South
Africa, but in their clubs and libraries they study and discuss the
causes which led to America's progress and pre-eminence, and form plans
by which they may be able to attain the same desirable ends.The
influence and example of the United States are not theoretical; they are
political factors which are felt in the discussion of every public
question and in the results of every election.The practical results of
American influence in South Africa may now be observed only in the
increasing exports to that country, but perhaps in another generation a
greater and better demonstration will be found in a constitution which
unites all the South African states under one independent government.If any corroboration of this sentiment were necessary, a statement made
by the man who is leader of the ruling party in Cape Colony would be
ample."If we want an example of the highest type of freedom," said W. P.
Schreiner, the present Premier of Cape Colony, "we must look to the
United States of America."[#]


[#] Americans' Fourth of July Banquet, Cape Town, 1897.American influences are felt in all phases of South African life, be
they social, commercial, religious, political, or retrogressive.Whether it be the American book agent on the banks of the Umkomaas, or
the American consul-general in the governor's mansion at Cape Town, his
indomitable energy, his breezy indifference to apparently insurmountable
difficulties, and his boundless resources will always secure for him
those material benefits for which men of other nationalities can do no
more than hope.Some of his rivals call it perverseness, callousness,
trickery, treachery, and what not; his admirers might ascribe his
success to energy, pluck, modern methods, or to that quality best
described by that Americanism--"hustling."American commercial interests in South Africa are of such recent growth,
and already of such great proportions, that the other nations who have
been interested in the trade for many years are not only astounded, but
are fearful that the United States will soon be the controlling spirit
in the country's commercial affairs.The enterprise of American
business firms, and their ability to undersell almost all the other
firms represented in the country, have given an enormous impetus to the
export trade with South African countries.Systematic efforts have been
made by American firms to work the South African markets on an extensive
scale, and so successful have the efforts been that the value of exports
to that country has several times been more than doubled in a single
year.Five years ago America's share of the business of South Africa was
practically infinitesimal; to-day the United States hold second place in
the list of nations which have trade relations with that country, having
outranked Germany, France, Belgium, Holland, and Italy.In several
branches of trade America surpasses even England, which has always had
all the trade advantages owing to the supremacy of her flag over the
greater part of the country.That the British merchants are keenly alive
to the situation which threatens to transfer the trade supremacy into
American hands has been amply demonstrated by the efforts which they
have made to check the inroads the Americans are making on their field,
and by the appointment of committees to investigate the causes of the
decline of British commerce.American enterprise shows itself by the scores of representatives of
American business houses who are constantly travelling through the
country, either to secure orders or to investigate the field with a view
of entering into competition with the firms of other nations.Fifteen
American commercial travellers, representing as many different firms,
were registered at the Grand Hotel, Cape Town, at one time a year ago,
and that all had secured exceptionally heavy orders indicated that the
innovation in the method of working trade was successful.The laws of the country are unfavourable in no slight degree to the
foreign commercial travellers, who are obliged to pay heavy licenses
before they are permitted to enter upon any business negotiations.The
tax in the Transvaal and Natal is $48.66, and in the Orange Free State
and Cape Colony it amounts to $121.66.If an American agent wishes to
make a tour of all the states and colonies of the country, he is obliged
to pay almost three hundred and fifty dollars in license fees.The great superiority of certain American manufactured products is such
that other nations are unable to compete in those lines after the
American products have been introduced.Especially is this true of
American machinery, which can not be equalled by that of any other
country.Almost every one of the hundreds of extensive gold mines on
the Randt is fitted out wholly or in part with American machinery, and,
at the present rate of increase in the use of it, it will be less than
ten years when none other than United States machinery will be sent to
that district.In visiting the great mines the uninitiated American is
astonished to find that engines, crushing machinery, and even the
electric lights which illuminate them, bear the name plates of New York,
Philadelphia, and Chicago firms.The Kimberley diamond mines, which are among the most extensive and most
elaborate underground works in the world, use American-made machinery
almost exclusively, not only because it is much less costly, but because
no other country can furnish apparatus that will give as good results.Almost every pound of electrical machinery in use in the country was
made in America and was instituted by American workmen.Instances of successful American electrical enterprises are afforded by
the Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and Pretoria street railways, almost
every rail, wire, and car of which bears the marks of American
manufacture.It is a marvellous revelation to find Philadelphia-made
electric cars in the streets of Cape Town, condensing engines from New
York State in Port Elizabeth, and Pittsburg generators and switchboards
in the capital of the Transvaal, which less than fifty years ago was
under the dominion of savages.Not only did Americans install the
street railways, but they also secured the desirable concessions for
operating the lines for a stated period.American electricians operate
the plants, and in not a few instances have financially embarrassed
Americans received a new financial impetus by acting in the capacities
of motormen and conductors.One street car in Cape Town was for a long time distinguished because of
its many American features.The Philadelphia-made car was propelled
over Pittsburg tracks by means of the power passing through Wilkesbarre
wires, and the human agencies that controlled it were a Boston motorman
and a San Francisco conductor.It might not be pursuing the subject too
far to add that of the twelve passengers in the car on a certain journey
ten were Americans, representing eight different States.One of the first railroads in South Africa--that which leads from
Lorenzo Marques to the Transvaal border--was built by an American, a Mr.Murdock, while American material entered largely into the construction
of the more extensive roads from the coast to the interior.American
rails are more quickly and more cheaply[#] obtainable in South Africa
than those of English make, but the influence which is exerted against
the use of other than British rails prevents their universal adoption.Notwithstanding the efforts of the influential Englishmen to secure
British manufactures wherever and whenever possible, American firms have
recently secured the contracts for forty thousand tons of steel rails
for the Cape Colony Railway system, and the prospects are that more
orders of a similar nature will be forthcoming.[#] "But the other day we gave an order for two hundred and fifty miles
of rails.We had a large number of tenders, and the lowest tender, you
may be sorry to hear, was sent by an American, Mr.Fortunately, however, the tender was not in order, and we were therefore
able to give the work to our own people.It may be said that this
American tender was a question of workmen and strikes."--Cecil J.
Rhodes, at a meeting of the stockholders of the Cape-Cairo Railway,
London, May 2, 1899.It is not in the sale of steel rails alone that the American
manufacturer is forging ahead of his competitors in South Africa.American manufactured wares of all kinds are in demand, and in many
instances they are leaders in the market.Especially true is this of
American agricultural implements, which are so much more adaptable to
the soil and much cheaper than any other make.Small stores in the
farming communities of Natal and Cape Colony sell American ploughshares,
spades, forks, rakes, and hoes almost exclusively, and it amazes the
traveller to find that almost every plough and reaper used by the more
progressive agriculturists bears the imprint "Made in the United
States."It is a strange fact that, although South Africa has vast areas covered
with heavy timber, almost all the lumber used in the mining districts is
transported thither from Puget Sound.The native timber being unsuited
for underground purposes and difficult of access, all the mine owners
are obliged to import every foot of wood used in constructing surface
and underground works of their mines, and at great expense, for to the
original cost of the timber is added the charges arising from the sea
and land transportation, import duties, and handling.The docks at Cape
Town almost all the year round contain one or more lumber vessels from
Puget Sound, and upon several occasions five such vessels were being
unloaded at the same time.American coal, too, has secured a foothold in South Africa, a sample
cargo of three thousand tons having been despatched thither at the
beginning of the year.Coal of good quality is found in several parts
of the Transvaal and Natal, but progress in the development of the mines
has been so slow that almost the total demand is supplied by Wales.Cape Colony has an extensive petroleum field, but it is in the hands of
concessionaires, who, for reasons of their own, refuse to develop it.American and Russian petroleums are used exclusively, but the former is
preferred, and is rapidly crowding the other out of the market.Among the many other articles of export to South Africa are flour, corn,
butter, potatoes, canned meats, and vegetables--all of which might be
produced in the country if South Africans took advantage of the
opportunities offered by soil and Nature.American live stock has been
introduced into the country since the rinderpest disease destroyed
almost all of the native cattle, and with such successful results that
several Western firms have established branches in Cape Town, and are
sending thither large cargoes of mules, horses, cattle, and sheep.Cecil J. Rhodes has recently stocked his immense Rhodesian farm with
American live stock, and, as his example is generally followed
throughout the country, a decided increase in the live-stock export
trade is anticipated.Statistics only can give an adequate idea of American trade with South
Africa; but even these are not reliable, for the reason that a large
percentage of the exports sent to the country are ordered through London
firms, and consequently do not appear in the official figures.As a
criterion of what the trade amounts to, it will only be necessary to
quote a few statistics, which, however, do not represent the true totals
for the reason given.The estimated value of the exports and the
percentage increase of each year's business over that of the preceding
year is given, in order that a true idea of the growth of American trade
with South Africa may be formed:

    YEAR.Per cent
                                         increase.1895                  $5,000,000
    1896                  12,000,000        140
    1897                  16,000,000         33 1/8
    1898 (estimated)      20,000,000         25


A fact that is deplored by Americans who are eager to see their country
in the van in all things pertaining to trade is that almost every
dollar's worth of this vast amount of material is carried to South
Africa in ships sailing under foreign colours.Three lines of
steamships, having weekly sailings, ply between the two countries, and
are always laden to the rails with American goods, but the American flag
is carried by none of them.A fourth line of steamships, to ply between
Philadelphia and Cape Town, is about to be established under American
auspices, and is to carry the American flag.A number of small American
sailing vessels trade between the two countries, but their total
capacity is so small as to be almost insignificant when compared with
the great volume carried in foreign bottoms.The American imports from South Africa are of far less value than the
exports, for the reason that the country produces only a few articles
that are not consumed where they originate.America is the best market
in the world for diamonds, and about one fourth of the annual output of
the Kimberley mines reaches the United States.Hides and tallow
constitute the leading exportations to America, while aloes and ostrich
feathers are chief among the few other products sent here.Owing to this
lack of exports, ships going to South Africa are obliged to proceed to
India or Australia for return cargoes in order to reduce the expenses of
the voyage.However great the commercial interests of the United States in South
Africa, they are small in comparison with the work of individual
Americans, who have been active in the development of that country
during the last quarter of a century.Wherever great enterprises have
been inaugurated, Americans have been prominently identified with their
growth and development, and in not a few instances has the success of
the ventures been wholly due to American leadership.European capital
is the foundation of all the great South African institutions, but it is
to American skill that almost all of them owe the success which they
have attained.British and continental capitalists have recognised the superiority of
American methods by intrusting the management of almost every large mine
and industry to men who were born and received their training in the
United States.It is an expression not infrequently heard when the
success of a South African enterprise is being discussed, "Who is the
Yankee?"The reason of this is involved in the fact that almost all the
Americans who went to South Africa after the discovery of gold had been
well fitted by their experiences in the California and Colorado mining
fields for the work which they were called upon to do on the Randt, and,
owing to their ability, were able to compete successfully with the men
from other countries who were not so skilled.Unfortunately, not all the Americans in South Africa have been a credit
to their native country, and there is a considerable class which has
created for itself an unenviable reputation.The component parts of
this class are men who, by reason of criminal acts, were obliged to
leave America for new fields of endeavour, and non-professional men who
follow gold booms in all parts of the world and trust to circumstances
for a livelihood.In the early days of the Johannesburg gold fields
these men oftentimes resorted to desperate means, with the result that
almost every criminal act of an unusually daring description is now
credited against them by the orderly inhabitants.Highwaymen,
pickpockets, illicit gold buyers, confidence men, and even train-robbers
were active, and for several years served to discredit the entire
American colony.Since the first gold excitement has subsided, this
class of Americans, in which was also included by the residents all the
other criminal characters of whatever nationality, has been compelled to
leave the country, and to-day the American colony in Johannesburg
numbers about three thousand of the most respected citizens of the city.The American who has been most prominent in South African affairs, and
the stanchest supporter of American interests in that country, is
Gardner F. Williams, the general manager and one of the alternate life
governors of the De Beers Consolidated Diamond Mines at Kimberley.Williams gained his mining experience in the
mining districts of California and other Western States, and went to
South Africa in 1887 to take charge of the Kimberley mines, which were
then in an almost chaotic condition.By the application of American
ideas, Mr.Williams succeeded in making of the mines a property which
yields an annual profit of about ten million dollars on a nominal
capital of twice that amount.He has introduced American machinery into
the mines, and has been instrumental in many other ways in advancing the
interests of his native country.Williams receives a salary
twice as great as that of the President of the United States, he is
proud to be the American consular agent at Kimberley--an office which
does not carry with it sufficient revenue to provide the star-spangled
banner which constantly floats from a staff in front of his residence.J. Perrott Prince is another American who has assisted materially in
extending American interests in South Africa, and it is due to his own
unselfish efforts that the commerce of the United States with the port
of Durban has risen from insignificant volume to its present size.Prince was a surgeon in the Union army during the civil war, and
afterward was one of the first Americans to go to the Kimberley diamond
fields.Leander Starr Jameson to
accompany him to Kimberley in the capacity of assistant surgeon--a
service which he performed with great distinction until Mr.Rhodes sent
him into Matabeleland to take charge of the military forces, which later
he led into the Transvaal.Prince's renown as a physician was responsible for a call to
Madagascar, whither he was summoned by Queen Ranavalo.He remained in
Madagascar as the queen's physician until the French took forcible
possession of the island and sent the queen into exile on the Reunion
Islands.Prince has lived in Durban, Natal, for several years, and
during the greater part of that time conducted the office of American
consular agent at a financial loss to himself.Prince was obliged to end his connection with the consular service, and
the United States are now represented in Durban by a foreigner, who on
the last Fourth of July inquired why all the Americans in the city were
making such elaborate displays of bunting and the Stars and Stripes.The consular agent at Johannesburg is John C. Manion, of Herkimer, N.Y.,
who represents a large American machinery company.Manion, in 1896,
carried on the negotiations with the Transvaal Government by which John
Hays Hammond, an American mining engineer, was released from the
Pretoria prison, where he had been confined for complicity in the
uprising at Johannesburg.American machinery valued at several million
dollars has been sent to South Africa as the result of Mr.In the gold industry on the Randt, Americans have been specially active,
and it is due to one of them, J. S. Curtis, that the deep-level mines
were discovered.In South Africa a mining claim extends only a
specified distance below the surface of the earth, and the Governments
do not allow claim-owners to dig beyond that depth.Curtis found
that paying reefs existed below the specified depth, and the result was
that the Government sold the underground or deep-level claims with great
profit to itself and the mining community.The consulting engineers of almost all the mines of any importance in
the country are Americans, and their salaries range from ten thousand to
one hundred thousand dollars a year.John Hays Hammond, who was one of
the first American engineers to reach the gold fields, was official
mining engineer for the Transvaal Government, and received a yearly
salary of twenty-five thousand dollars for formulating the mining laws
of the country.He resigned that office, and is now the consulting
engineer for the British South Africa Company in Rhodesia and several
gold mines on the Randt, at salaries which aggregate almost one hundred
thousand dollars a year.Among the scores of other American engineers on
the Randt are L. I. Seymour, who has control of the thirty-six shafts of
the Randt Mines; Captain Malan, of the Robinson mines; and H. S. Watson,
of the Simmer en Jack mines, in developing which more than ten million
dollars have been spent.Another American introduced the system of treating the abandoned
tailings of the mines by the cyanide process, whereby thousands of
ounces of gold have been abstracted from the offal of the mills, which
had formerly been considered valueless.Others have revolutionized
different parts of the management of the mines, and in many instances
have taken abandoned properties and placed them on a paying basis.It
would not be fair to claim that American ingenuity and skill are
responsible for the entire success of the Randt gold mines, but it is
indisputable that Americans have done more toward it than the combined
representatives of all other nations.Every line of business on the Randt has its American representatives,
and almost without exception the firms who sent them thither chose able
men.W. E. Parks, of Chicago, represents Frazer & Chalmers, whose
machinery is in scores of the mines.His assistant is W. H. Haig, of
New York city.The American Trading and Importing Company, with its headquarters in
Johannesburg, and branches in every city and town in the country, deals
exclusively in American manufactured products, and annually sells
immense quantities of bicycles, stoves, beer, carriages, and other
goods, ranging from pins to pianos.Americans do not confine their endeavours to commercial enterprises, and
they may be found conducting missionary work among the Matabeles and
Mashonas, as well as building dams in Rhodesia.American missionaries
are very active in all parts of South Africa, and because of the
practical methods by which they endeavour to civilize and Christianize
the natives they have the reputation throughout the country of being
more successful than those who go there from any other country.Rhodes has given many contributions of land and
money to the American missionaries, and has on several occasions
complimented them by pronouncing their achievements unparalleled.A practical illustration will demonstrate the causes of the success of
the American missionary.An English missionary spent the first two
years after his arrival in the country in studying the natives' language
and in building a house for himself.In that time he had made no
converts.An American missionary arrived at almost the same time,
rented a hut, and hired interpreters.At the end of two years he had
one hundred and fifty converts, many more natives who were learning
useful occupations and trades, and had sent home a request for more
missionaries with which to extend his field.It is rather remarkable that the scouts who assisted in subduing the
American Indians should later be found on the African continent to
assist in the extermination of the blacks.In the Matabele and Mashona
campaigns of three years ago, Americans who scouted for Custer and Miles
on the Western plains were invaluable adjuncts to the British forces,
and in many instances did heroic work in finding the location of the
enemy and in making way for the American Maxim guns that were used in
the campaigns.The Americans in South Africa, although only about ten thousand in
number, have been of invaluable service to the land.They have taught
the farmers to farm, the miners to dig gold, and the statesmen to
govern.Their work has been a credit to the country which they continue
to revere, and whose flag they raise upon every proper occasion.They
have taken little part in the political disturbances of the Transvaal,
because they believe that the citizens of a republic should be allowed
to conduct its government according to their own idea of right and
justice, independently of the demands of those who are not citizens.CHAPTER XII

                         JOHANNESBURG OF TO-DAY


The palms and bamboos of Durban, the Zulu policemen and 'ricksha boys,
and the hospitable citizens have been left behind, and the little train
of English compartment cars, each with its destination "Johannesburg"
labelled conspicuously on its sides, is winding away through cane fields
and banana groves, past groups of open-eyed natives and solemn,
thin-faced Indian coolies.Pretty little farmers' cottages in settings of palms, mimosas, and
tropical plants are dotted in the green valleys winding around the
innumerable small hills that look for all the world like so many
inverted moss-covered china cups.Lumbering transport wagons behind a
score of sleek oxen, wincing under the fire of the far-reaching rawhide
in the hands of a sparsely clad Zulu driver, are met and passed in a
twinkling.Neatly thatched huts with natives lazily lolling in the sun
become more frequent as the train rolls on toward the interior, and the
greenness of the landscape is changing into the brown of dead verdure,
for it is the dry season--the South African winter.The hills become
more frequent, and the little locomotive goes more slowly, while the
train twists and writhes along its path like a huge python.Now it is on the hilltop from which the distant sea and its coast fringe
of green are visible on the one side, and nothing but treeless brown
mountain tops on the other.A minute later it plunges down the
hillside, along rocky precipices, over deep chasms, and then wearily
plods up the zigzag course of another hillside.For five hours or more
the monotony of miniature mountains continues, relieved by nothing more
interesting than the noise of the train and the hilarious laughter and
weird songs of a car load of Zulus bound for the gold fields.After
this comes an undulating plain and towns with far less interest in their
appearance than in their names.The traveller surfeited with Natal
scenery finds amusement and diversion in the conductor's call of Umbilo,
Umkomaas, Umgeni, Amanzimtoti, Isipingo, Mooi River, Zwartkop, or
Pietermaritzburg, but will not attempt to learn the proper pronunciation
of the names unless he has weeks at his command.[Illustration: Zulu maidens shaking hands.]Farther on in the journey an ostrich, escaped from a farm, stalks over
the plain, and, approaching to within several yards of the train, jogs
along for many miles, and perchance wheedles the engineer into impromptu
races.Hardly has the bird disappeared when on the wide veldt a herd of
buck galloping with their long heads down, or a large number of
wildebeest, plunging and jumping like animated hobby-horses, raise
clouds of dust as they dash away from the monster of iron and steam.Shortly afterward the train passes a waterfall almost thrice as lofty as
Niagara, but located in the middle of the plain, into whose surface the
water has riven a deep and narrow chasm.Since the balmy Indian Ocean has been left behind, the train has been
rising steadily, sometimes an inch in a mile but oftener a hundred feet,
and the air has grown cooler.The thousands of British soldiers at
Ladysmith are wearing heavy clothing; their horses, tethered in the open
air, are shivering, and far to the westward is the cause of it all--the
lofty, snow-covered peaks of the Dragon Mountain.Night comes on and
clothes the craggy mountains and broken valleys with varying shades of
sombreness.The moon outlines the snow far above, and with its rays
marks the lofty line where sky and mountain crest seem to join.Morning
light greets the train as it dashes down the mountain side, through the
passes that connect Natal with the Transvaal and out upon the withered
grass of the flat, uninteresting veldt of the Boer country.The South African veldt in all its winter hideousness lies before you.It stretches out in all directions--to the north and south, to the east
and west--and seems to have no boundaries.Its yellowish brownness eats
into the brain, and the eyes grow weary from the monotony of the scene.Hour after hour the train bears onward in a straight line, but the
landscape remains the same.But for noises and motions of the cars you
would imagine that the train was stationary, so far as change of scenery
is concerned.Occasionally a colony of huge ant-heaps or a few buck or
deer may be passed, but for hours it is veldt, veldt, veldt!An entire
day's journey, unrelieved except toward the end by a few straggling
towns of Boer farmhouses or the sheet-iron cabins of prospectors, bring
it to Heidelberg, once the metropolis as well as the capital of the
republic, but now pining because the former distinguishing mark has been
yielded to its neighbour, Johannesburg.As the shades of another night commence to fall, the veldt suddenly
assumes a new countenance.Lights begin to sparkle, buildings close
together appear, and scores of tall smokestacks tower against the
background of the sky.The presence of the smoke-stacks denote the
arrival at the Randt, and for twenty miles the train rushes along this
well-defined gold-yielding strip of land.Buildings, lights, stacks,
and people become more numerous as the train progresses into the city
limits of Johannesburg, and the traveller soon finds himself in the
middle of a crowd of enthusiastic welcoming and welcomed persons on the
platform of the station of the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche
Spoorweg-Maatschappij, and in the Golden City.The sudden change from the dreary lifelessness of the veldt to the
exciting crush and bustle of the station platform crowd is almost
bewildering, because it is so different from what is expected in
interior Africa.The station, a magnificent structure of stone and
iron, presents more animated scenes whenever trains arrive than the
Grand Central in New York or the Victoria in London, because every
passenger is invariably met at the train by all his friends and as many
of their friends as the station platform will accommodate.The crowd
which surges around this centre of the city's life is of a more
cosmopolitan character than that which can be found in any other city in
the world with the exceptions of Zanzibar and Port Said.Almost every
race is represented in the gathering, which is suggestive of a mass
meeting of the villagers of the Midway Plaisance at the Columbian
Exposition.In the crowd are stolid Anglo-Saxons shaking hands
effusively; enthusiastic Latins embracing each other; <DW64>s rubbing
noses and cheeks; smiling Japanese; cold, stern Chinese; Cingalese,
Russians, Malays, and Egyptians--all in their national costumes, and all
welcoming friends in their native manner and language.Meandering
through the crowd are several keen-eyed Boer policemen, commonly called
"Zarps," politely directing the attention of innocent-looking newcomers
to placards bearing the inscription "Pas op Zakkenrollers," which is the
Boer warning of pickpockets.After the traveller has forced a way through the crowd he is attacked by
a horde of cabmen who can teach tricks of the trade to the London and
New York night-hawks.Their equipages range from dilapidated broughams
to antique 'rickshas, but their charges are the same--"a quid," or five
dollars, either for a mile or a minute's ride.After the insults which
follow a refusal to enter one of their conveyances have subsided, the
agents of the hotels commence a vociferous campaign against the
newcomers, and very clever it is in its way.They are able to
distinguish a foreigner at one glance, and will change the name of the
hotel which they represent a score of times in as many seconds in order
to bag their quarry.For the patriotic American they have the New York
Hotel, the Denver House, the Hotel California, and many other hostelries
named after American cities.they will salute an American,
"Come up to the New York Hotel and patronize American enterprise."If
the traveller will accompany one of these agents he will find that all
the names apply to one hotel, which has an American name but is
conducted and patronized by a low class of foreigners.The victim of
misrepresentation will seek another hotel, and will be fortunate if he
finds comfortable quarters for less than ten dollars a day, or three
times the amount he would be called upon to pay at a far better hotel in
any American city of equal size.The privilege of fasting, or of
awakening in the morning with a layer of dust an eighth of an inch deep
on the counterpane and on the face may be ample return for the
extraordinary charges, but the stranger in the city is not apt to adopt
that view of the situation until he is acclimated.The person who has spent several days in crossing the veldt and enters
Johannesburg by night has a strange revelation before him when he is
awakened the following morning.He has been led to believe that the city
is a motley collection of corrugated-iron hovels, hastily constructed
cabins, and cheap public buildings.Instead he finds a beautiful city,
with well-paved streets, magnificent buildings of stone and brick,
expensive public buildings, and scores of palatial residences.Many
American cities of the same size and many times older can not show as
costly buildings or as fine public works.Hotels of five and six
stories, and occupying, in several instances, almost entire blocks, are
numerous; of office buildings costing a quarter of a million dollars
each there are half a score; banks, shops, and newspapers have three-
and four-story buildings of brick and stone, while there are hundreds of
other buildings that would be creditable to any large city in America or
Europe.The Government Building in the centre of the city is a
five-story granite structure of no mean architectural beauty.In the
suburbs are many magnificent private residences of mine owners and
managers who, although not permanent residents of the city, have
invested large amounts of money, so that the short time they spend in
the country may be amid luxurious and comfortable surroundings.One of the disagreeable features of living in Johannesburg is the dust
which is present everywhere during the dry season.It rises in great,
thick clouds on the surrounding veldt, and, obscuring the sun, wholly
envelops the city in semi-darkness.One minute the air is clear and
there is not a breath of wind; several minutes later a hurricane is
blowing and blankets of dust are falling.The dust clouds generally
rise west of the city, and almost totally eclipse the sun during their
progress over the plain.Sometimes the dust storms continue only a few
minutes, but very frequently the citizens are made uncomfortable by them
for days at a time.Whenever they arrive, the doors and windows of
buildings are tightly closed, business is practically at a standstill,
and every one is miserable.It penetrates
every building, however well protected, and it lodges in the food as
well as in the drink.Pedestrians on the street are unable to see ten
feet ahead, and are compelled to walk with head bowed and with
handkerchief over the mouth and nostrils.Umbrellas and parasols are
but slight protection against it.Only the miners, a thousand feet
below the surface, escape it.When the storm has subsided the entire
city is covered with a blanket of dust ranging in thickness from an inch
on the sidewalks to an eighth of an inch on the store counters,
furniture, and in pantries.It has never been computed how great a
quantity of the dust enters a man's lungs, but the feeling that it
engenders is one of colossal magnitude.Second to the dust, the main characteristic of Johannesburg is the
inhabitants' great struggle for sudden wealth.It is doubtful whether
there is one person in the city whose ambition is less than to become
wealthy in five years at least, and then to return to his native
country.It is not a chase after affluence; it is a stampede in which
every soul in the city endeavours to be in the van.In the city and in
the mines there are hundreds of honourable ways of becoming rich, but
there are thousands of dishonourable ones; and the morals of a mining
city are not always on the highest plane.There are business men of the
strictest probity and honesty, and men whose word is as good as their
bond, but there are many more who will allow their conscience to lie
dormant so long as they remain in the country.With them the passion is
to secure money, and whether they secure it by overcharging a regular
customer, selling illicit gold, or gambling at the stock exchanges is a
matter of small moment.Tradesmen and shopkeepers will charge according
to the apparel of the patron, and will brazenly acknowledge doing so if
reminded by the one who has paid two prices for like articles the same
day.Hotels charge according to the quantity of luggage the traveller
carries, and boarding-houses compute your wealth before presenting their
bills.Street-car fares and postage stamps alone do not fluctuate in
value, but the wise man counts his change.The experiences of an American with one large business house in the city
will serve as an example of the methods of some of those who are eager
to realize their ambitions.The American spent many weeks and much
patience and money in securing photographs throughout the country, and
took the plates to a large firm in Johannesburg for development and
printing.When he returned two weeks later he was informed that the
plates and prints had been delivered a week before, and neither prayers
nor threats secured a different answer.Justice in the courts is slow
and costly, and the American was obliged to leave the country without
his property.Shortly after his departure the firm of photographers
commenced selling a choice collection of new South African photographs
which, curiously, were of the same scenes and persons photographed by
the American.Gambling may be more general in some other cities, but it can not be
more public.The more refined gamblers patronize the two stock
exchanges, and there are but few too poor to indulge in that form of
dissipation.Probably nine tenths of the inhabitants of the city travel
the stock-exchange bypath to wealth or poverty.Women and boys are as
much infected by the fever as mine owners and managers, and it would not
be slandering the citizens to say that one fourth of the conversation
heard on the streets refers to the rise and fall of stocks.The popular gathering place in the city is the street in front of one of
the stock exchanges known as "The Chains."During the session of the
exchange the street is crowded with an excited throng of men, boys, and
even women, all flushed with the excitement of betting on the rise and
fall of mining stocks in the building.Clerks, office boys, and miners
spend the lunch hour at "The Chains," either to invest their wages or to
watch the market if their money is already invested.A fall in the
value of stocks is of far greater moment to them than war, famine, or
pestilence.The passion for gambling is also satisfied by a giant lottery scheme
known as "Sweepstakes," which has the sanction of the Government.Thousands of pounds are offered as prizes at the periodical drawings,
and no true Johannesburger ever fails to secure at least one ticket for
the drawing.When there are no sessions of the stock exchanges, no
sweepstakes, horse races, ball games, or other usual opportunities for
gambling, they will bet on the arrival of the Cape train, the length of
a sermon, or the number of lashes a <DW64> criminal can endure before
fainting.Drinking is a second diversion which occupies much of the time of the
average citizen, because of the great heat and the lack of amusement.The liquor that is drunk in Johannesburg in one year would make a stream
of larger proportions and far more healthier contents than the Vaal
River in the dry season.It is a rare occurrence to see a man drink
water unless it is concealed in brandy, and at night it is even rarer
that one is seen who is not drinking.Cape Smoke, the name given to a
liquor made in Cape Colony, is credited with the ability to kill a man
before he has taken the glass from his lips, but the popular Uitlander
beverage, brandy and soda, is even more fatal in its effects.Pure
liquor is almost unobtainable, and death-dealing counterfeits from
Delagoa Bay are the substitutes.Twenty-five cents for a glass of beer
and fifty cents for brandy and soda are not deterrent prices where
ordinary mine workers receive ten dollars a day and mine managers fifty
thousand dollars a year.Of social life there is little except such as is afforded by the clubs,
of which there are several of high standing.The majority of the men
left their families in their native countries on account of the severe
climate, and that fact, combined with the prevalent idea that the
weather is too torrid to do anything unnecessary, is responsible for
Johannesburg's lack of social amenity.There are occasional dances and
receptions, but they are participated in only by newcomers who have not
yet fallen under the spell of the South African sun.The Sunday night's
musical entertainments at the Wanderer's Club are practically the only
affairs to which the average Uitlander cares to go, because he can
clothe himself for comfort and be as dignified or as undignified as he
pleases.The true Johannesburger is the most independent man in the world.When
he meets a native on the sidewalk he promptly kicks him into the street,
and if the action is resented, bullies a Boer policeman into arresting
the offender.The policeman may demur and call the Johannesburger a
"Verdomde rooinek," but he will make the arrest or receive a drubbing.He may be arrested in turn, but he is ever willing and anxious to pay a
fine for the privilege of beating a "dumb Dutchman," as he calls him.He pays little attention to the laws of the country, because he has not
had the patience to learn what they consist of, and he rests content in
knowing that his home government will rescue him through diplomatic
channels if he should run counter to the laws.He cares nothing
concerning the government of the city except as it interferes with or
assists his own private interests, but he will take advantage of every
opportunity to defy the authority of the administrators of the laws.He
despises the Boers, and continually and maliciously ridicules them on
the slightest pretexts.Specially true is this of those newspapers
which are the representatives of the Uitlander population.Venomous
editorials against the Boer Government and people appear almost daily,
and serve to widen the breach between the two classes of inhabitants.The Boer newspapers for a long time ignored the assaults of the
Uitlander press, but recently they have commenced to retaliate, and the
editorial war is a bitter one.An extract from the Randt Post will show
the nature and depth of bitterness displayed by the two classes of
newspapers:

"Though Dr.Leyds may be right, and the Johannesburg population safe in
case of war, we advise that, at the first act of war on the English
side, the women and children, and well-disposed persons of this town, be
given twenty-four hours to leave, and then the whole place be shot down;
in the event, we repeat--which God forbid!--of war coming."If, indeed, there must be shooting, then it will be on account of
seditious words and deeds of Johannesburg agitators and the
co-shareholders in Cape Town and London, and the struggle will be
promoted for no other object than the possession of the gold.Well,
then, let such action be taken that the perpetrators of these turbulent
proceedings shall, if caught, be thrown into the deep shafts of their
mines, with the debris of the batteries for a costly shroud, and that
the whole of Johannesburg, with the exception of the Afrikander wards,
be converted into a gigantic rubbish heap to serve as a mighty tombstone
for the shot-down authors of a monstrous deed."If it be known that these valuable buildings and the lives of the
wire-pullers are the price of the mines, then people will take good heed
before the torch of war is set alight.Friendly talks and protests are
no use with England.Let force and rough violence be opposed to the
intrigues and plots of Old England, and only then will the Boer remain
master."It is on Saturday nights that the bitterness of the Uitlander population
is most noticeable, since then the workers from the mines along the
Randt gather in the city and discuss their grievances, which then become
magnified with every additional glass of liquor.It is then that the
city streets and places of amusement and entertainment are crowded with
a throng that finds relaxation by abusing the Boers.The theatre
audiences laugh loudest at the coarsest jests made at the expense of the
Boers, and the bar-room crowds talk loudest when the Boers are the
subject of discussion.The abuse continues even when the not-too-sober
Uitlander, wheeled homeward at day-break by his faithful Zulu 'ricksha
boy, casts imprecations upon the Boer policeman who is guarding his
property.Johannesburg is one of the most expensive places of residence in the
world.Situated in the interior of the continent, thousands of miles
distant from the sources of food and supplies, it is natural that
commodities should be high in price.Almost all food stuffs are carried
thither from America, Europe, and Australia, and consequently the
original cost is trebled by the addition of carriage and customs duties.The most common articles of food are twice as costly as in America,
while such commodities as eggs, imported from Madeira, frequently are
scarce at a dollar a dozen.Butter from America is fifty cents a pound,
and fruits and vegetables from Cape Colony and Natal are equally high in
price and frequently unobtainable.Good board can not be obtained
anywhere for less than five dollars a day, while the best hotels and
clubs charge thrice that amount.Rentals are exceptionally high owing
to the extraordinary land values and the cost of erecting buildings.A
small, brick-lined, corrugated-iron cottage of four rooms, such as a
married mine-employee occupies, costs from fifty to seventy-five dollars
a month, while a two-story brick house in a respectable quarter of the
city rents for one hundred dollars a month.Every object in the city is mutely expressive of a vast expenditure of
money.The idea that everything--the buildings, food, horses, clothing,
machinery, and all that is to be seen--has been carried across oceans
and continents unconsciously associates itself with the cost that it has
entailed.Four-story buildings that in New York or London would be
passed without remark cause mental speculation concerning their cost,
merely because it is so patent that every brick, nail, and board in them
has been conveyed thousands of miles from foreign shores.Electric
lights and street cars, so common in American towns, appear abnormal in
the city in the veldt, and instantly suggest an outlay of great amounts
of money even to the minds which are not accustomed to reducing
everything to dollars and pounds.Leaving the densely settled centre of
the city, where land is worth as much as choice plots on Broadway, and
wandering into the suburbs where the great mines are, the idea of cost
is more firmly implanted into the mind.The huge buildings, covering
acres of ground and thousands of tons of the most costly machinery, seem
to be of natural origin rather than of human handiwork.It is almost
beyond belief that men should be daring enough to convey hundreds of
steamer loads of lumber and machinery halfway around the world at
inestimable cost merely for the yellow metal that Nature has hidden so
far distant from the great centres of population.The cosmopolitanism of the city is a feature which impresses itself most
indelibly upon the mind.In a half-day's stroll in the city
representatives of all the peoples of the earth, with the possible
exception of the American Indian, Eskimos, and South Sea islanders, will
be seen variously engaged in the struggle for gold.On the floors of the
stock exchanges are money barons or their agents, as energetic and sharp
as their prototypes of Wall and Throckmorton Streets.These are chiefly
British, French, and German.Outside, between "The Chains," are readily
discernible the distinguishing features of the Americans, Afrikanders,
Portuguese, Russians, Spaniards, and Italians.A few steps distant is
Commissioner Street, the principal thoroughfare, where the surging
throng is composed of so many different racial representatives that an
analysis of it is not an easy undertaking.He is considered an expert
who can name the native country of every man on the street, and if he
can distinguish between an American and a Canadian he is credited with
being a wise man.In the throng is the tall, well-clothed Briton, with silk hat and frock
coat, closely followed by a sparsely clad Matabele, bearing his master's
account books or golf-sticks.Near them a Chinaman, in circular
red-topped hat and flowing silk robes, is having a heated argument in
broken English with an Irish hansom-driver.Crossing the street are two
stately Arabs, in turbans and white robes, jostling easy-going Indian
coolies with their canes.Bare-headed Cingalese, their long, shiny hair
tied in knots and fastened down with circular combs, noiselessly gliding
along, or stopping suddenly to trade Oriental jewelry for Christian's
money; Malays, Turks, Egyptians, Persians, and New-Zealanders, each with
his distinctive costume; Hottentots, Matabeles, Zulus, Mashonas,
Basutos, and the representatives of hundreds of the other native races
south of the Zambezi pass by in picturesque lack of bodily adornment.It is an imposing array, too, for the majority of the throng is composed
of moderately wealthy persons, and even in the centre of Africa wealth
carries with it opportunities for display.John Chinaman will ride in a
'ricksha to his joss-house with as much conscious pride as the European
or American will sit in his brougham or automobile.Money is as easily
spent as made in Johannesburg, and it is a cosmopolitan habit to spend
it in a manner so that everybody will know it is being spent.To make a
display of some sort is necessary to the citizen's happiness.If he is
not of sufficient importance to have his name in the subsidized
newspapers daily he will seek notoriety by wearing a thousand pounds'
worth of diamonds on the street or making astonishing bets at the
race-track.In that little universe on the veldt every man tries to be
superior to his neighbour in some manner that may be patent to all the
city.When it is taken into consideration that almost all the
contestants were among the cleverest and shrewdest men in the countries
whence they came to Johannesburg, and not among the riffraff and
failures, then the intensity of the race for superiority can be
imagined.Johannesburg might be named the City of Surprises.Its youthful
existence has been fraught with astonishing works.It was born in a
day, and one day's revolution almost ended its existence.It grew from
the desert veldt into a garden of gold.Its granite residences, brick
buildings, and iron and steel mills sprang from blades of grass and
sprigs of weeds.It has transformed the beggar into a millionaire, and
it has seen starving men in its streets.It harbours men from every
nation and climate, but it is a home for few.It is far from the centre
of the earth's civilization, but it has often attracted the whole
world's attention.It supports its children, but by them it is cursed.Its god is in the earth upon which it rests, and its hope of future life
in that which it brings forth.And all this because a man upturned the
soil and called it gold.Better get a lover first----

JO.I've already got one!--If I had a son like that I'd
bang him right and left!A sailor
never knows that sooner or later--He never thinks of that--If Geert
were that way--there, I know--Aunt, imagine--Geert----

BOS.He'd face the devil--eh, Aunt?Now, I'm going to finish the
potatoes.Say, black eyes--do you laugh all the time?[Calls back from
the opened door.]Geert?--Is that your son, who----

KNEIR.Yes, Meneer--Couldn't keep his hands at
home.I think they must have teased him----

BOS.Discipline would be thrown overboard to the sharks if
sailors could deal out blows every time things didn't go to suit them.That's so, Meneer, but----

BOS.And is she--smitten with that good-for-nothing?She's crazy about him, and well she may be.He's a handsome
lad, takes after his father--and strong--there is his photograph--he
still wore the uniform then--first class--now he is----

BOS.Degraded?----

KNEIR.He's been to India twice--it
is hard--if he comes next week--or in two weeks--or tomorrow, I don't
know when--I'll have him to feed, too--although--I must say it of
him, he won't let the grass grow under his feet--A giant like him
can always find a skipper.A sweet beast--I tell you right now, Kneir, I'd rather not take
him--dissatisfied scoundrels are plenty enough these days--All that
come from the Navy, I'm damned if it isn't so--are unruly and I have
no use for that kind--Am I not right?Certainly, Meneer, but my boy----

BOS.There was Jacob--crooked Jacob, the skipper had to discharge
him.He was, God save him, dissatisfied with everything--claimed
that I cheated at the count--yes--yes--insane.Now he's trying it at
Maassluis.May I send him to the skipper then--or direct to the water
bailiff's office?Yes, but you tell him----

KNEIR.If he comes in time, he can go out on the Good Hope.They are bringing the provisions and casks aboard
now.She'll come back with a full cargo--You know that.Pieterse's steam trawler--The deuce![Both go off--the stage remains empty--a vague murmur of voices
outside.Fishermen, in conversation, pass the window.Geert sneaks inside through the door at
left.Throws down a bundle tied in a red handkerchief.Looks cautiously
into the bedsteads, the cooking shed, peers through the window, then
muttering he plumps down in a chair by the table, rests his head on
his hand, rises again; savagely takes a loaf of bread from the back
cupboard, cuts off a hunk.Walks back to chair, chewing, lets the
bread fall; wrathfully stares before him.Who's there?--Geert!--[Entering.]Yes--it's me--Well, why don't you give me a paw.No, where is she----

BAR.Mother, she--she----

GEERT.You look so--so pale----

GEERT.No, fine!--What a question--They feed you on beefsteaks!Go and get some then--if I don't have a swallow, I'll keel over.[Peers in his pocket, throws a handful of coins on
the table.]Earned that in prison--There!----

BAR.I don't care a damn--so you hurry.Don't stare so, stupid----

BAR.I can't get used to your face--it's so queer.I must grow a beard at once!--Say, did they
make a devil of a row?Jo enters, a dead rabbit in her hand.][Lets the rabbit fall.]--Geert![Rushes to him, throws
her arms about his neck, sobbing hysterically.]I am so happy--so happy, dear Geert----

GEERT.My head can't
stand such a lot of noise----

JO.You don't understand it of course--six months
solitary--in a dirty, stinking cell.[Puts his hand before his eyes
as if blinded by the light.]Drop the curtain a bit--This sunshine
drives me mad!My God--Geert----

GEERT.They didn't like my beard--The government took that--become
ugly, haven't I?--Look as if I'd lost my wits?The
beggars; to shut up a sailor in a cage where you can't walk, where you
can't speak, where you--[Strikes wildly upon the table with his fist.]Don't you meddle with this--Where is a glass?--Never
mind--[Swallows eagerly.][Puts the bottle again to
his lips.]Please, Geert--no more--you can't stand it.That's the best way
to tan your stomach.Don't look so unhappy,
girl--I won't get drunk!Not accustomed to it--Are
there any provisions on board?That will do for tomorrow--Here, you, go and lay in a
supply--some ham and some meat----

BAR.No--that's extravagance--If you want to buy meat, keep your money
till Sunday.Sunday--Sunday--If you hadn't eaten anything for six months but
rye bread, rats, horse beans--I'm too weak to set one foot before the
other.and--and a piece of cheese--I feel
like eating myself into a colic.God!--I'm glad to see you cheerful again.Yes, there's some
tobacco left--in the jar.Who did you flirt with, while I sat----

JO.Haven't
had the taste in my mouth for half a year.This isn't tobacco;
[Exhales.]The gin stinks and the pipe stinks.You'll sleep nice and warm up there, dear.Why is the looking-glass on
the floor?No--it's me--Geert----

KNEIR.You--what have you done to make me happy!Never mind that now----

GEERT.If you intend to reproach
me?--I shall----

KNEIR.Pack my bundle!----

KNEIR.Do you expect me to sit on the sinner's bench?The whole village talked about you--I
couldn't go on an errand but----

GEERT.Let them that talk say it to my face.No, but you raised your hand against your superior.I should have twisted my fingers in his throat.Boy--boy; you make us all unhappy.Treated like a beast, then I get the devil
besides.[At the door,
hesitates, throws down his bundle.]Don't cry,
Mother--I would rather--Damn it!Please--Auntie dear----

KNEIR.Never would he have
looked at you again--And he also had a great deal to put up with.I'm glad I'm different--not so submissive--It's a great honor
to let them walk over you!I have no fish blood in me--Now then,
is it to go on raining?I'd knock the teeth out of his jaw tomorrow.I've sat long enough, hahaha!--Let me walk to get the hang of
it.Now I'll--But for you it would never have happened----

JO.But for me?--that's a good
one!That cad--Don't you remember dancing with him at the tavern
van de Rooie?I?--Danced?----

GEERT.With that cross-eyed quartermaster?--I don't understand a word
of it--was it with him?--And you yourself wanted me to----

GEERT.You can't refuse a superior--On board ship he had stories.I
overheard him tell the skipper that he----

JO.That he--never mind what--He spoke of you as if you were any
sailor's girl.I!--The low down----

GEERT.When he came into the hold after the dog watch, I hammered
him on the jaw with a marlin spike.Five minutes later I sat in
irons.Kept in them six days--[Sarcastically.]the provost was full;
then two weeks provost; six months solitary; and suspended from the
navy for ten years; that, damn me, is the most--I'd chop off my two
hands to get back in; to be <DW65>-driven again; cursed as a beggar
again; ruled as a slave again----

KNEIR.Geert--Geert--Don't speak such words.In the Bible it stands
written----

GEERT.Stands written--If there was only something written
for us----

KNEIR.If he had gone politely to the Commander----

GEERT.You should have been a sailor,
Mother--Hahaha!They were too glad of the chance to clip and
shear me.While I was in the provost they found newspapers in my bag I
was not allowed to read--and pamphlets I was not allowed to read--that
shut the door--otherwise they would have given me only third class----

KNEIR.Newspapers you were not allowed to read?Why--simple soul--Ach!--when I look at your submissive face I
see no way to tell why--Why do men desert?--Why, ten days before this
happened to me, did Peter the stoker cut off his two fingers?--Just
for a joke?I can't blame you people--you knew no
better--and I admired the uniform--But now that I've got some brains
I would like to warn every boy that binds himself for fourteen years
to murder.Boy, don't say such dreadful things--you are
excited----

GEERT.No--not at all--worn out, in fact--in Atjeh I fought
with the rest--stuck my bayonet into the body of a poor devil till the
blood spurted into my eyes--For that they gave me the Atjeh medal.[Jo picks up the bundle;
Barend looks on.][Jerks the medal from his
jacket, throws it out of the window.]you have dangled on my
breast long enough!I no longer know
you----

GEERT.Who--who took an innocent boy, that couldn't count ten, and
kidnaped him for fourteen years?Who drilled and trained him for a
dog's life?Who put him in irons when he defended his girl?Irons--you
should have seen me walking in them, groaning like an animal.Near me
walked another animal with irons on his leg, because of an insolent
word to an officer of the watch.Six days with the damned irons on
your claws and no power to break them.Don't talk about it any more, you are still so tired----

GEERT.[Wrapped in the grimness of his story.]Then the provost,
that stinking, dark cage; your pig stye is a palace to it.A cage
with no windows--no air--a cage where you can't stand or lie down.A
cage where your bread and water is flung to you with a "there, dog,
eat!"There was a big storm in those days,--two sloops were battered to
pieces;--when you expected to go to the bottom any moment.Never again
to see anyone belongin' to me--neither you--nor you--nor you.To go
down in that dark, stinking hole with no one to talk to--no comrade's
hand!--No, no, let me talk--it lightens my chest!A fellow has lots to
bring in there.Gold
epaulettes sitting in judgment on the trash God has kicked into the
world to serve, to salute, to----

KNEIR.Six months--six months in a cell for reformation.To be reformed
by eating food you could not swallow;--rye bread, barley, pea soup,
rats!Three months I pasted paper bags, and when I saw the chance I
ate the sour paste from hunger.Three months I sorted peas; you'll
not believe it, but may I never look on the sea again if I lie.At
night, over my gas light, I would cook the peas I could nip in my
slop pail.When the handle became too hot to hold any longer, I ate
them half boiled--to fill my stomach.That's to reform you--reform
you--for losing your temper and licking a blackguard that called your
girl a vile name, and reading newspapers you were not allowed to read.Fresh from the sea--in a cell--no
wind and no water, and no air--one small high window with grating like
a partridge cage.The foul smell and the nights--the damned nights,
when you couldn't sleep.When you sprang up and walked, like an insane
man, back and forth--back and forth--four measured paces.The nights
when you sat and prayed not to go insane--and cursed everything,
everything, everything![After a long pause goes to him and throws her arms about his
neck.Kneirtje weeps, Barend stands dazed.]Don't let us--[Forcibly controlling his tears.][Goes to the window--says to Barend.]Lay
out the good things--[Draws up the curtain.]if the
rooster isn't sitting on the roof again, ha, ha, ha!I would like to sail at once--two days on the Sea!the
Sea!--and I'm my old self again.What?--Why is Truus crying as she
walks by?Ssst!--Don't call after her.The Anna has just come in without
her husband.[A few sad-looking, low-speaking women walk past the
window.][Drops the window
curtain, stands in somber thought.]That is to say----

MARIETJE.Yes--I won't go far--I must----

MARIETJE.Well, Salamander, am I a child?I must--I must----[Abruptly
off.]You should have seen him day before yesterday--half the
village at his heels.When Mother was living he didn't
dare.She used to slap his face for him when he smelled of gin--just
let me try it.You say that as though--ha ha ha!I never have seen Mees drinking--and father very seldom
formerly.Ah well--I can't put a cork in his mouth, nor lead him
around by a rope.Gone, of course--to
the Rooie.Young for her years, isn't she, eh?Sit down and tell me
[Merrily.]You know we would
like to marry at once [Smiles, hesitates.]because--because----Well,
you understand.But Mees had to send for his papers first--that takes
two weeks--by that time he is far out at sea; now five weeks--five
little weeks will pass quickly enough.That's about the same----Are you two!----Now?----I told
you everything----

[Jo shrugs her shoulders and laughs.]May you live to be a hundred----

KNEIR.You may try one--you, too--gingerbread nuts--no,
not two, you, with the grab-all fingers!For each of the boys a
half pound gingerbread nuts--and a half pound chewing tobacco--and
a package of cigars.Do you know what I'm going to give Barend since
he has become so brave--look----

JO.Now--you should give those to Geert----

KNEIR.No, I'm so pleased with the lad that he has made up his mind
I want to reward him.These are ever so old, they are earrings.My
husband wore them Sundays, when he was at home.There are little ships on them--masts--and sails--I wish
I had them for a brooch.You had a time getting him to sign--Eh!But he was willing to go with his brother--and
now take it home to yourself--a boy that is not strong--not very
strong--rejected for the army, and a boy who heard a lot about his
father and Josef.First you curse and scold at him, and
now nothing is too good.In an hour he will be gone,
and you must never part in anger.We
have fresh wafers and ginger cakes all laid in for my birthday--set it
all ready, Jo.Saart is coming soon, and the boys may take a dram, too.A sweet young Miss
    And a glass of Anis--
    I shall surely come in for this.[Hides it in his red handkerchief.]No--now--you
know what I want to say.I don't need to ask if----[Pours the dram.]No--no--go ahead--just a little more.No matter, I shan't spill a drop.Lips to the glass, sucks up the liquor.]When you have my years!--Hardly slept a wink last night--and
no nap this afternoon.That's what he would like to do----

MARIETJE.Now, if I had my choice----

KNEIR.The Matron at the Home has to
help dress him.the Englishman says: "The old man misses the kisses, and
the young man kisses the misses."Yes, that means, "Woman, take your cat inside, its beginning to
rain."Good day, Daantje; day, Cobus; and day, Marietje; and day,
Jo.No, I'm not going to do it--my door is ajar--and the cat may
tip over the oil stove.No, just give it to me this way--so--so--many
happy returns, and may your boys--Where are the boys?Geert has gone to say good bye, and Barend has gone with Mees
to take the mattresses and chests in the yawl.They'll soon be here,
for they must be on board by three o'clock.There was a lot of everything and more too.The bride was
full,--three glasses "roses without thorns," two of "perfect love,"
and surely four glasses of "love in a mist."Where she stowed
it all I don't know.Give me the old fashioned dram, brandy and syrup--eh!He's come here to sleep--you look as if you hadn't been to
bed at all.In his bed--he, he, he!No, I say, don't take out your chew.No, you'd never guess how I got it.Less than ten
minutes ago I met Bos the ship-owner, and he gave me--he gave me a
little white roll--of--of tissue paper with tobacco inside.Yes, catch me smoking a thing like that in--in paper--that's a
chew with a shirt on.And you're a crosspatch without a shirt.No, I'm not going to
sit down.Day, Simon--shove in, room for you here.Give him just one, for a parting cup.Is there much work in the dry dock, Simon?No, if I sit down I stay too long.Well then, half a
glass--no--no cookies.It looks like all hands on deck
here!Uh--ja----

MARIETJE.The deuce, but you're touchy!We've got a quarter of an hour,
boys!Fallen asleep with a ginger nut in his hand.Sick in the night--afraid to call the matron; walked about
in his bare feet; got chilled.It's easy for you to talk, but if you disturb her, she keeps
you in for two weeks.Poor devils--I don't want to live to be so old.We're not even married
yet--and he's a widower already!I don't need a belaying pin----[Sings.]"Sailing, sailing, don't wait to be called;
    Starboard watch, spring from your bunk;
    Let the man at the wheel go to his rest;
    The rain is good and the wind is down.It's sailing, it's sailing,
    It's sailing for the starboard watch."[The others join him in beating time on the table with their fists.]You'll do the same when you're as old
as I am.You might have said that a while back when you
looked like a wet dish rag.Now we can make up a song about you, pasting paper
bags--just as Domela--he he he!My nevvy Geert pastes paper bags,
    Hi-ha, ho!My nevvy Geert----

SAART.DAAN., JO., MARIETJE AND COBUS.I'm blest if I see----

MARIETJE.They must--they must--not--not--that's fast.You must--you must----

MARIETJE.The ribs--and--and----[Firmly.]That's fast!----

GEERT, JO., COBUS, DAANTJE AND SAART.You went together to take the mattresses and chests----

MEES.Can't repeat a word of it--afraid--afraid--always afraid----[To
Marietje, who has induced her father to rise.]Now--now--Kneir, many happy returns.Perhaps he's saying good-bye to his girl.[Sound of Jelle's
fiddle outside.]Do sit still--one would think you'd eaten horse flesh.Poor old fellow, gets blinder every day.Yes, play that tune of--of--what do you call 'em?You know, Jelle, the one--that one that goes [Sings.]"I know
a song that charms the heart."Give us----[Jelle begins the Marseillaise.]"Alloose--vodela--bedeije--deboe--debie--de boolebie."That's the French of a dead codfish!I've laid in a French port--and say, it
was first rate!When I said pain they gave me bread--and when I said
"open the port," they opened the door.Let's use the
Dutch words we've got for it."Arise men, brothers, all united!Your wrongs, your sorrows be avenged"--

BOS.[Who has stood at the open window listening during the singing,
yells angrily.]It's high time you were all on board!Oh--Oh--how he scared me--he!I couldn't think where the voice came from.How stupid of you to roar like a weaned pig, when you know
Meneer Bos lives only two doors away.You'll never eat a sack of salt with him.What business had you to sing those low songs, anyway?If he
hadn't taken me by surprise!An old frog like that before your eyes
of a sudden.Ach, please don't, Geert.I'm afraid that if Meneer
Bos----[Motions to Jelle to stop.]This one is afraid to sail, this one of the Matron of the Old
Men's Home, this one of a little ship owner!Forbids me in my own
house!Commands me as though I were a servant!Fun is fun, but if you were a ship owner, you wouldn't want
your sailors singing like socialists either.When he knows how dependent I am, too.Is it an
honor to do his cleaning!For mopping the office floor and
licking his muddy boots you get fifty cents twice a week and the
scraps off their plates.Oh, what a row I'll get Saturday!If you hadn't all your
life allowed this braggart who began with nothing to walk over you
and treat you as a slave, while father and my brothers lost their
lives on the sea making money for him, you'd give him a scolding and
damn his hide for his insolence in opening his jaw.Next
year Mother will give you pennies to play."Arise men, brothers,
all unite-e-ed"----

KNEIR.Stop tormenting your old mother on her birthday.[Jelle
holds out his hand.]Here, you can't stand on one leg.I'll wait a few minutes for Barend.The
boys will come by here any way.Don't you catch on that those two are--A good voyage.Have I staid so long--and my door ajar![Brusquely coming through the kitchen door.]Skipper Hengst has my orders.[Cobus
and Daantje slink away, stopping outside to listen at the window.]Yes, Meneer, he is all ready to go.That other boy of yours that Hengst engaged--refuses to go.[They bow in a
scared way and hastily go on.]This looks like a dive--drunkenness
and rioting.Mother's birthday or not, we do as we please here.You change your tone or----

GEERT.Ach--dear Geert--Don't take offense, Meneer--he's
quick tempered, and in anger one says----

BOS.Dirt is all the thanks you get for
being good to you people.If you're not on board in
ten minutes, I'll send the police for you!You send--what do you take me for, any way!What I take him for--he asks that--dares to ask----[To
Kneirtje.]You'll come to me again recommending a trouble-maker kicked
out by the Navy.You
pay wages and I do the work.You're just a big overgrown boy, that's all!If it wasn't for Mother--I'd----

KNEIR.Kneir, Kneir,
consider well what you do--I gave you an advance in good faith----

KNEIR.Ach, yes, Meneer--Ach, yes----

BOS.Yes, Meneer--you and the priest----

BOS.One of your sons refuses to go, the other--you'll come to a bad
end, my little friend.On board I'm a sailor--I'm the skipper
here.A ship owner layin' down the law; don't do
this and don't do that!Boring his nose through the window when you
don't sing to suit him.For my part, sing, but a sensible sailor expecting to marry ought
to appreciate it when his employer is looking out for his good.You
young fellows have no respect for grey hairs.for grey hairs that
have become grey in want and misery----

BOS.Your mother's seen me, as child,
standing before the bait trays.I also have stood in an East wind
that froze your ears, biting off bait heads----

GEERT.We don't care for your stories, Meneer.You have
become a rich man, and a tyrant.Good!--you are perhaps no worse than
the rest, but don't interfere with me in my own house.We may all become different, and perhaps my son may
live to see the day when he will come, as I did, twelve years ago,
crying to the office, to ask if there's any news of his father and
his two brothers!and not find their employer sitting by his warm fire
and his strong box, drinking grog.He may not be damned for coming so
often to ask the same thing, nor be turned from the door with snubs
and the message, "When there's anything to tell you'll hear of it."You lie--I never did anything of the sort.I won't soil any more words over it.My father's hair was grey, my mother's hair is grey, Jelle,
the poor devil who can't find a place in the Old Men's Home because
on one occasion in his life he was light-fingered--Jelle has also
grey hairs.If you hear him or crooked
Jacob, it's the same cuckoo song.But
now I'll give another word of advice, my friend, before you go under
sail.You have an old mother, you expect to marry, good; you've been
in prison six months--I won't talk of that; you have barked out your
insolence to me in your own house, but if you attempt any of this
talk on board the Hope you'll find out there is a muster roll.When you've become older--and wiser--you'll be ashamed of your
insolence--"the ship owner by his warm stove, and his grog"----

GEERT.And his strong box----

BOS.And his cares, you haven't the wits to understand!Who hauls the fish out of the sea?Who
risks his life every hour of the day?Who doesn't take off his
clothes in five or six weeks?Who walks with hands covered with salt
sores,--without water to wash face or hands?Who sleep like beasts
two in a bunk?Who leave wives and mothers behind to beg alms?Twelve
head of us are presently going to sea--we get twenty-five per cent
of the catch, you seventy-five.We do the work, you sit safely at
home.Your ship is insured, and we--we can go to the bottom in case
of accident--we are not worth insuring----

KNEIR.You should be a clown in a
circus!Twenty-seven per cent isn't enough for him----

GEERT.I'll never eat salted codfish from your generosity!Our whole
share is in "profit and loss."When luck is with us we each make eight
guilders a week, one guilder a day when we're lucky.One guilder a
day at sea, to prepare salt fish, cod with livers for the people in
the cities--hahaha!--a guilder a day--when you're lucky and don't go
to the bottom.You fellows know what you're about when you engage us
on shares.[Old and young heads of fishermen appear at the window.]And say to the skipper--no, never mind--I'll
be there myself----[A pause.]Now I'll
take two minutes more, blockhead, to rub under your nose something
I tried three times to say, but you gave me no chance to get in a
word.When you lie in your bunk tonight--as a beast, of course!--try
and think of my risks, by a poor catch--lost nets and cordage--by
damages and lightning in the mast, by running aground, and God knows
what else.The Jacoba's just had her hatches torn off, the Queen
Wilhelmina half her bulwarks washed away.You don't count that,
for you don't have to pay for it!Three months ago the Expectation
collided with a steamer.Without a thought of the catch or the nets,
the men sprang overboard, leaving the ship to drift!You laugh, boy, because you don't realize what cares I
have.On the Mathilde last week the men smuggled gin and tobacco in
their mattresses to sell to the English.If you were talking about conditions in Middelharnis or Pernis,
you'd have reason for it.My men don't pay the harbor costs, don't
pay for bait, towing, provisions, barrels, salt.I don't expect you
to pay the loss of the cordage, if a gaff or a boom breaks.I go into
my own pocket for it.I gave your mother an advance, your brother
Barend deserts.No, Meneer, I can't believe that.Hengst telephoned me from the harbor, else I wouldn't have
been here to be insulted by your oldest son, who's disturbing the
whole neighborhood roaring his scandalous songs!If you're not on board on time I'll apply "Article
Sixteen" and fine you twenty-five guilders.As for you, my wife doesn't need you at
present, you're all a bad lot here.Ach, Meneer, it isn't my fault!After this voyage you can look for
another employer, who enjoys throwing pearls before swine better than
I do!Don't hang your head so soon, Aunt!Geert was in the right----

KNEIR.Great God, if he should desert--if he
deserts--he also goes to prison--two sons who----

GEERT.Aren't you going to wish me a good voyage--or don't you think
that necessary?Yes, I'm coming----

JO.I'm sorry for her, the poor thing.You gave him a
talking to, didn't you?[Picks a geranium from a flower
pot.]And you will
think of me every night, will you?Truus saw him hanging around the house.If that coward refuses to go,
your sitting at home won't help a damn.Don't forget your chewing tobacco
and your cigars----

GEERT.If you're too late--I'll never look at you again!I'll shout the whole village together if you don't
immediately run and follow Geert and Jo.If you can keep Geert from going--call him back!Have you gone crazy with fear, you big coward?The Good Hope is no good, no good--her ribs are
rotten--the planking is rotten!----

KNEIR.Don't stand there telling stories to excuse yourself.Simon, the ship carpenter--that drunken sot who can't speak
two words.First you sign, then you
run away!Me--you may beat me to death!--but I won't go on an unseaworthy
ship!Hasn't the ship been lying in the
dry docks?There was no caulking her any more--Simon----

KNEIR.March, take your package of
chewing tobacco.I'm not going--I'm not going.You don't know--you
didn't see it!The last voyage she had a foot of water in her hold!A ship that has just returned from her fourth
voyage to the herring catch and that has brought fourteen loads!Has
it suddenly become unseaworthy, because you, you miserable coward,
are going along?I looked in the hold--the barrels were
floating.You can see death that is hiding down there.Bilge water, as in every ship!Tell that
to your grandmother, not to an old sailor's wife.Skipper Hengst
is a child, eh!Isn't Hengst going and Mees and Gerrit and Jacob
and Nellis--your own brother and Truus' little Peter?Do you claim
to know more than old seamen?I'm not going to
stand it to see you taken aboard by the police----

BAR.Oh, Mother dear, Mother dear, don't make me go!Oh, God; how you have punished me in my children--my children
are driving me to beggary.I've taken an advance--Bos has refused to
give me any more cleaning to do--and--and----[Firmly.]Well, then,
let them come for you--you'd better be taken than run away.Oh, oh,
that this should happen in my family----

BAR.You'll not get out----

BAR.I don't know what I'm doing--I might hurt----

KNEIR.Now he is brave, against his sixty year old mother----Raise
your hand if you dare![Falls on a chair shaking his head between his hands.]Oh, oh,
oh--If they take me aboard, you'll never see me again--you'll never
see Geert again----

KNEIR.It's tempting God to rave this
way with fear----[Friendlier tone.]Come, a man of your age must
not cry like a child--come!I wanted to surprise you with Father's
earrings--come!Mother dear--I don't dare--I don't dare--I shall drown--hide
me--hide me----

KNEIR.If I believed a word of your talk,
would I let Geert go?There's a
package of tobacco, and one of cigars.Now sit still, and I'll put
in your earrings--look--[Talking as to a child.]--real silver--ships
on them with sails--sit still, now--there's one--there's two--walk
to the looking glass----

BAR.No--no!----

KNEIR.Come now, you're making me weak for nothing--please,
dear boy--I do love you and your brother--you're all I have on
earth.Every night I will pray to the good God to bring you
home safely.You must get used to it, then you will become a brave
seaman--and--and----[Cries.][Holds the
mirror before him.]Look at your earrings--what?----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Coming in through door at left, good-natured
manner.]Skipper Hengst has requested the Police----If you please,
my little man, we have no time to lose.The ship--is rotten----

2ND POLICEMAN.Then you should not have
mustered in.[Taps him kindly
on the shoulder.][Clings desperately to the
bedstead and door jamb.]I shall
drown in the dirty, stinking sea!Oh God, Oh
God, Oh God![Crawls up against the wall, beside himself with terror.]The boy is afraid----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Sobbing as she seizes Barend's hands.]Come now, boy--come
now--God will not forsake you----

BAR.[Moaning as he loosens his hold, sobs despairingly.]You'll
never see me again, never again----

1ST POLICEMAN.[They exeunt, dragging Barend.]Oh, oh----

TRUUS.What was the matter,
Kneir?Barend had to be taken by the police.Oh, and now
I'm ashamed to go walk through the village, to tell them good bye--the
disgrace--the disgrace----

                                CURTAIN.A lighted lamp--the illuminated
chimney gives a red glow.Kneirtje lying on bed, dressed, Jo reading
to her from prayerbook.]in piteousness,
      To your poor children of the sea,
    Reach down your arms in their distress;
      With God their intercessor be.Unto the Heart Divine your prayer
    Will make an end to all their care."[A
knock--she tiptoes to cook-shed door, puts her finger to her lips in
warning to Clementine and Kaps, who enter.]She's not herself yet,
feverish and coughing.I've brought her a plate of soup, and a half dozen
eggs.I've brought you some veal soup, Kneir.I'd like to see you carry a full pan with the sand blowing in
your eyes.There's five--and--[Looking at his hand, which drips with egg
yolk.][Bringing out his handkerchief and purse covered with egg.]He calls that putting them away
carefully.My purse, my handkerchief, my cork screw.I don't know why Father keeps that bookkeeper, deaf,
and cross.They haven't
forgotten the row with your sons yet.Mouth shut, or I'll get a
scolding.May Jo go to the beach with me to look at the sea?Go on the beach in such a
storm!I got a tap aft that struck the spot.The tree beside the pig stye was broken in two like a pipe stem.Did it come down on the pig stye?Uncle Cobus,
how do you come to be out, after eight o'clock, in this beastly
weather?The beans and pork gravy he ate----

CLEMENTINE.Beans and pork gravy for a sick old man?The matron broils him a chicken or a beefsteak--Eh?She's
even cross because she's got to beat an egg for his breakfast.This
afternoon he was delirious, talking of setting out the nets, and paying
out the buoy line.I sez to the matron, "His time's come.""Look out or
yours'll come," sez she.I sez, "The doctor should be sent for.""Mind
your own business," sez she, "am I the Matron or are you?"Then I
sez, "You're the matron."Just now, she sez,
"You'd better go for the doctor."As if it couldn't a been done this
afternoon.I go to the doctor and the doctor's out of town.Now I've
been to Simon to take me to town in his dog car.If drunken Simon drives, you're likely to roll off
the <DW18>.Must the doctor ride in the dog
car?Go on, now, tell us the rest.What I want to say is, that it's a blessing for Daantje he's
out of his head, 'fraid as he's always been of death.That's all in the way you look at it.If my time
should come tomorrow, then, I think, we must all!The waters of the sea
will not wash away that fact.On the fifth
day He created the Sea, great whales and the moving creatures that
abound therein, and said: "Be fruitful," and He blessed them.That
was evening and that was morning, that was the fifth day.And on the
sixth day He created man and said also: "Be fruitful," and blessed
them.That was again evening and again morning, that was the sixth
day.When I was on the herring
catch, or on the salting voyage, there were times when I didn't dare
use the cleaning knife.Because when you shove a herring's head
to the left with your thumb, and you lift out the gullet with the
blade, the creature looks at you with such knowing eyes, and yet
you clean two hundred in an hour.And when you cut throats out of
fourteen hundred cod, that makes twenty-eight hundred eyes that look
at you!I had few
equals in boning and cutting livers.Tja, tja, and how afraid they all
were!They looked up at the clouds as if they were saying:
"How about this now.I say:
we take the fish and God takes us.We must all, the beasts must,
and the men must, and because we all must, none of us should--now,
that's just as if you'd pour a full barrel into an empty one.I'd
be afraid to be left alone in the empty barrel, with every one else
in the other barrel.No, being afraid is no good; being afraid is
standing on your toes and looking over the edge.You act as if you'd had
a dram.Am I right about the pig
stye or not?Hear how the poor animal is going on out there.I'm sure
the wall has fallen in.You pour yourself out a bowl, Uncle Cobus!I'll give her a
helping hand.Cobus, I'll thank God when the Good Hope is safely in.But the Hope is an old ship,
and old ships are the last to go down.No, that's what every old sailor says.All the same, I shall pray
God tonight.But the Jacoba is out and the
Mathilda is out and the Expectation is out.The Good Hope is rotten--so--so----[Stops anxiously.]That's what----Why--that's what----I thought----It just
occurred to me.If the Good Hope was rotten, then your father would----

CLEMENTINE.Oh, shut your fool mouth, you'll make Kneir anxious.Quick,
Kneir, shut the door, for the lamp.How scared Barend will be, and just as
they're homeward bound.The evening is still so long and
so gloomy--Yes?[Enter Simon and Marietje, who is crying.]Stop your damn
howling----

KNEIRTJE.Her lover is also--be a good seaman's
wife.You girls haven't had any trouble
yet!If it wasn't for Daan----

JO.Here, this will warm you up, Simon.It's happened to me before
with the dog car, in a tempest like this.And when the
doctor came, Katrien was dead and the child was dead, but if you ask
me, I'd rather sit in my dog car tonight than to be on the sea.No, don't let us waste our time.Let's talk, then we won't
think of anything.Last night was stormy, too, and I had such a bad dream.I can't rightly say it was a dream.There was a rap on the
window, once.Soon as I lay down there came another rap, so.[Raps on
the table with her knuckles.]And then I saw Mees, his face was pale,
pale as--God!Each time--like that, so----[Raps.]You stupid, you, to scare the old woman into a fit with your
raps.My ears and neck full of sand, and it's
cold.Just throw a couple of blocks on the fire.I couldn't stand it at home either, children asleep, no one
to talk to, and the howling of the wind.Two mooring posts were
washed away.What's that to us----Milk and sugar?Your little son was a brave boy, Truus.I can see him
now as he stood waving good-bye.Yes, that boy's a treasure, barely twelve.You
should have seen him two and a half months ago.The child behaved like an angel, just like a grown
man.He would sit up evenings to chat with me, the child knows more
than I do.The lamb, hope he's not been awfully sea sick.Now, you may not believe it, but red spectacles
keep you from being sea sick.You're like the doctors, they let others swallow their doses.Many's the night I've slept on board; when my husband was
alive I went along on many a voyage.Should like to have seen you in oil skins.Hear, now, the young lady is flattering me.I'm not so bad
looking as that, Miss.Now and then, when things
didn't go to suit him, without speaking ill of the dead, I may say,
he couldn't keep his paws at home; then he'd smash things.I still
have a coffee pot without a handle I keep as a remembrance.--I wouldn't
part with it for a rix dollar.I won't even offer you a guilder!Say, you're such a funny story teller, tell us about the Harlemmer
oil, Saart.Yes, if it hadn't been for Harlemmer oil I might not have been
a widow.Now, then, my man was a comical chap.I'd bought him a knife in a leather sheath, paid a good price
for it too, and when he'd come back in five weeks and I'd ask him:
"Jacob, have you lost your knife?"he'd say, "I don't know about my
knife--you never gave me a knife."But
when he'd undress himself for the first time in five weeks, and pulled
off his rubber boots, bang, the knife would fall on the floor.He
hadn't felt it in all that time.Didn't take off his rubber boots in five weeks?Then I had to scrub 'im with soap and soda; he hadn't seen
water, and covered with vermin.Wish I could get a cent a dozen for all the lice on board;
they get them thrown in with their share of the cargo.Now
then, his last voyage a sheet of water threw him against the bulwarks
just as they pulled the mizzen staysail to larboard, and his leg was
broke.Then they were in a fix--The skipper could poultice and cut a
corn, but he couldn't mend a broken leg.Then they wanted to shove a
plank under it, but Jacob wanted Harlemmer oil rubbed on his leg.Every
day he had them rub it with Harlemmer oil, and again Harlemmer oil,
and some more Harlemmer oil.When they came in
his leg was a sight.You shouldn't have asked me to tell it.Now, yes; you can't bring the dead back to life.And when you
think of it, it's a dirty shame I can't marry again.A year later
the Changeable went down with man and mouse.Then, bless me, you'd
suppose, as your husband was dead, for he'd gone along with his leg
and a half, you could marry another man.First you must
advertise for him in the newspapers three times, and then if in three
times he don't turn up, you may go and get a new license.I don't think I'll ever marry again.That's not surprisin' when you've been married twice already;
if you don't know the men by this time.I wish I could talk about things the way you do.With my first it was a horror; with my second you know
yourselves.I could sit up all night hearing tales of
the sea.Don't tell stories of suffering and death----

SAART.[Quietly knitting and speaking in a toneless voice.]Ach,
it couldn't have happened here, Kneir.We lived in Vlaardingen then,
and I'd been married a year without any children.No, Pietje was Ari's
child--and he went away on the Magnet.And you understand what happened;
else I wouldn't have got acquainted with Ari and be living next door
to you now.The Magnet stayed on the sands or some other place.But
I didn't know that then, and so didn't think of it.Now in Vlaardingen they have a tower and on the tower a lookout.And this lookout hoists a red ball when he sees a lugger or
a trawler or other boat in the distance.And when he sees who it
is, he lets down the ball, runs to the ship owner and the families
to warn them; that's to say: the Albert Koster or the Good Hope is
coming.Now mostly he's no need to warn the family.For, as soon as
the ball is hoisted in the tower, the children run in the streets
shouting, I did it, too, as a child: "The ball is up!Then the women run, and wait below for the lookout to come down,
and when it's their ship they give him pennies.And--and--the Magnet with my first
husband, didn't I say I'd been married a year?The Magnet stayed out
seven weeks--with provisions for six--and each time the children
shouted: "The ball is up, Truus!Then I
ran like mad to the tower.They all knew why
I ran, and when the lookout came down I could have torn the words
out of his mouth.But I would say: "Have you tidings--tidings of
the Magnet?"Then he'd say: "No, it's the Maria," or the Alert,
or the Concordia, and then I'd drag myself away slowly, so slowly,
crying and thinking of my husband.And each day, when
the children shouted, I got a shock through my brain, and each day I
stood by the tower, praying that God--but the Magnet did not come--did
not come.At the last I didn't dare to go to the tower any more when
the ball was hoisted.No longer dared to stand at the door waiting,
if perhaps the lookout himself would bring the message.That lasted
two months--two months--and then--well, then I believed it.Now, that's so short a time since.Ach, child, I'd love to talk about it to every
one, all day long.When you've been left with six children--a good
man--never gave me a harsh word--never.Had it happened six
days later they would have brought him in.They smell when there's
a corpse aboard.Yes, that's true, you never see them otherwise.You'll never marry a fisherman, Miss; but it's sad,
sad; God, so sad!when they lash your dear one to a plank, wrapped in
a piece of sail with a stone in it, three times around the big mast,
and then, one, two, three, in God's name.No, I wasn't thinking of Mees, I was thinking of my little
brother, who was also drowned.Wasn't that on the herring catch?His second voyage, a blow
from the fore sail, and he lay overboard.The
skipper reached him the herring shovel, but it was smooth and it
slipped from his hands.Then Jerusalem, the mate, held out the broom
to him--again he grabbed hold.The three of them pulled him up; then
the broom gave way, he fell back into the waves, and for the third
time the skipper threw him a line.God wanted my little brother, the
line broke, and the end went down with him to the bottom of the sea.frightful!--Grabbed it three times, and lost
it three times.As if the child knew what was coming in the morning, he had
lain crying all night.Crying for Mother, who was
sick.When the skipper tried to console him, he said: "No, skipper,
even if Mother does get well, I eat my last herring today."No, truly, Miss, when he came back from Pieterse's with the
money, Toontje's share of the cargo as rope caster, eighteen guilders
and thirty-five cents for five and a half weeks.Then he simply acted
insane, he threw the money on the ground, then he cursed at--I won't
repeat what--at everything.Mother's sickness and burial
had cost a lot.Eighteen guilders is a heap of money, a big heap.Eighteen guilders for your child, eighteen--[Listening in alarm
to the blasts of the wind.]No, say, Hahaha!----

KNEIRTJE.Yes, yes, if the water could
only speak.Come now, you tell a tale of the sea.Ach, Miss, life on the sea is no tale.Nothing
between yourself and eternity but the thickness of a one-inch
plank.It's hard on the men, and hard on the women.Yesterday I passed
by the garden of the Burgomaster.They sat at table and ate cod from
which the steam was rising, and the children sat with folded hands
saying grace.Then, thought I, in my ignorance--if it was wrong, may
God forgive me--that it wasn't right of the Burgomaster--not right
of him--and not right of the others.For the wind blew so hard out
of the East, and those fish came out of the same water in which our
dead--how shall I say it?--in which our dead--you understand me.It is our living,
and we must not rebel against our living.When the lead was dropped he could tell by the taste of the
sand where they were.Often in the night he'd say we are on the 56th
and on the 56th they'd be.Once
he drifted about two days and nights in a boat with two others.That
was the time they were taking in the net and a fog came up so thick
they couldn't see the buoys, let alone find the lugger.Later when the boat went to pieces--you should
have heard him tell it--how he and old Dirk swam to an overturned
rowboat; he climbed on top."I'll never forget that night," said
he.Dirk was too old or tired to get a hold.Then my husband stuck
his knife into the boat.Dirk tried to grasp it as he was sinking,
and he clutched in such a way that three of his fingers hung
down.Then at the risk of his own life,
my husband pulled Dirk up onto the overturned boat.So the two of
them drifted in the night, and Dirk--old Dirk--from loss of blood
or from fear, went insane.He sat and glared at my husband with the
eyes of a cat.He raved of the devil that was in him.Of Satan, and
the blood, my husband said, ran all over the boat--the waves were
kept busy washing it away.Just at dawn Dirk slipped off, insane
as he was.My man was picked up by a freighter that sailed by.But
it was no use, three years later--that's twelve years ago now--the
Clementine--named after you by your father--stranded on the Doggerbanks
with him and my two oldest.Of what happened to them, I know nothing,
nothing at all.Never a buoy, or a hatch, washed ashore.You can't realize it at first, but after so many years one
can't recall their faces any more, and that's a blessing.For hard it
would be if one remembered.Every sailor's
wife has something like this in her family, it's not new.Truus is
right: "The fish are dearly paid for."We are all in God's hands, and God is great and good.[Beating her
head with her fists.]You're all driving me mad, mad, mad!Her husband and her little brother--and my poor
uncle--those horrible stories--instead of cheering us up!My father was drowned, drowned, drowned,
drowned!There are others--all--drowned, drowned!--and--you are all
miserable wretches--you are![Violently bangs the door shut as she
runs out.]No, child, she will quiet down by herself.Nervous strain
of the last two days.It has grown late, Kneir, and your niece--your niece was a
little unmannerly.Thank you again, Miss, for the soup and eggs.Are you coming to drink a bowl with me tomorrow night?If you see Jo send her in at once.[All go out except
Kneirtje.A fierce wind howls, shrieking
about the house.She listens anxiously at the window, shoves her
chair close to the chimney, stares into the fire.Her lips move in
a muttered prayer while she fingers a rosary.Jo enters, drops into
a chair by the window and nervously unpins her shawl.]And that dear child that came out in the storm to bring me
soup and eggs.Your sons are out in the storm for her and her father.Half the guard
rail is washed away, the pier is under water.You never went on like this
when Geert sailed with the Navy.In a month or two
it will storm again; each time again.And there are many fishermen on
the sea besides our boys.[Her speech sinks into a soft murmur.Her
old fingers handle the rosary.]Barend, we almost drove him away![Seeing that Kneirtje prays, she walks to the window wringing
her hands, pulls up the curtain uncertainly, stares through the window
panes.The wind blows the
curtain on high, the lamp dances, the light puffs out.oh!----

KNEIRTJE.[Jo
lights the lamp, shivering with fear.][To Jo,
who crouches sobbing by the chimney.]If anything happens--then--then----

KNEIRTJE.Now, I ask you, how will it be when you're married?You don't know
what you say, Aunt Kneir!If Geert--[Stops, panting.]That was not
good of you--not good--to have secrets.Your lover--your husband--is

fire.Even if
it was wrong of you and of him.Come and sit opposite to me, then
together we will--[Lays her prayerbook on the table.]If anything happens----

KNEIRTJE.If anything--anything--anything--then I'll never pray
again, never again.No Mother Mary--then there
is nothing--nothing----

KNEIRTJE.[Opens the prayerbook, touches Jo's arm.Jo looks up, sobbing
passionately, sees the prayerbook, shakes her head fiercely.Again
wailing, drops to the floor, which she beats with her hands.Kneirtje's
trembling voice sounds.][The wind races with wild lashings about the house.]Left, office door, separated from the
main office by a wooden railing.Between this door and railing are
two benches; an old cupboard.In the background; three windows with
view of the sunlit sea.In front of the middle window a standing
desk and high stool.Right, writing table with telephone--a safe,
an inside door.On the walls, notices of wreckage, insurance, maps,

KAPS.: 2,447 ribs, marked Kusta; ten sail sheets, marked 'M."Four deck beams, two spars, five"----

MATHILDE.I have written the circular for the tower
bell.Connect me with the
Burgomaster!Up to my ears
in--[Sweetly.]My little wife asks----

MATHILDE.If Mevrouw will come to the telephone about the circular.If Mevrouw
will come to the telephone a moment?Just so, Burgomaster,--the
ladies--hahaha!Then it can go to the
printers.Do you think I
haven't anything on my mind!That damned----

MATHILDE.No,
she can't come to the telephone herself, she doesn't know
how.My wife has written the circular for
the tower bell."You are no doubt acquainted with the new church."--She
says, "No," the stupid!I am reading, Mevrouw, again."You are no
doubt acquainted with the new church.The church has, as you know,
a high tower; that high tower points upward, and that is good, that is
fortunate, and truly necessary for many children of our generation"----

MATHILDE.Pardon, I was speaking to
my bookkeeper.Yes--yes--ha, ha, ha--[Reads again
from paper.]"But that tower could do something else that also is
good.It can mark the time for us children of the
times.It stands there since 1882 and has never
answered to the question, 'What time is it?'It
was indeed built for it, there are four places visible for faces;
for years in all sorts of ways"--Did you say anything?No?--"for years
the wish has been expressed by the surrounding inhabitants that they
might have a clock--About three hundred guilders are needed.The Committee, Mevrouw"--What did you say?Yes, you know the
names, of course.Yes--Yes--All the ladies of
the Committee naturally sign for the same amount, a hundred guilders
each?Yes--Yes--Very well--My wife will be at home, Mevrouw.Damned nonsense!--a hundred guilders gone to the devil!What
is it to you if there's a clock on the damn thing or not?I'll let you fry in your own fat.She'll be here in her carriage in quarter of an hour.If you drank less grog in the evenings
you wouldn't have such a bad temper in the mornings.You took five guilders out of my purse this morning
while I was asleep.I can keep no----

MATHILDE.Bah, what a man, who counts his money before he goes to bed!Very well, don't give it--Then I can treat the Burgomaster's
wife to a glass of gin presently--three jugs of old gin and not a
single bottle of port or sherry![Bos angrily throws down two rix
dollars.]If it wasn't for me you wouldn't
be throwing rix dollars around!--Bah!IJmuiden, 24 December--Today there were four sloops
in the market with 500 to 800 live and 1,500 to 2,100 dead haddock
and some--live cod--The live cod brought 7 1/4--the dead----

BOS.The dead haddock brought thirteen and a half guilders a basket.Take
your book--turn to the credit page of the Expectation----

KAPS.no--the Good Hope?--We can whistle for her.Fourteen hundred and forty-three guilders and forty-seven cents.How could you be so ungodly stupid, to deduct four
guilders, 88, for the widows and orphans' fund?--1,443--3 per cent off--that's
1,400--that's gross three hundred and 87 guilders--yes, it should be
three guilders, 88, instead of four, 88.If you're going into your dotage, Jackass!There might be something to say against
that, Meneer--you didn't go after me when, when----

BOS.Now, that'll do, that'll do!----

KAPS.And that was an error with a couple of big ciphers after it.[Bos
goes off impatiently at right.]It all depends on what side----

[Looks around, sees Bos is gone, pokes up the fire; fills his pipe from
Bos's tobacco jar, carefully steals a couple of cigars from his box.]Mynheer Bos, eh?--no.Meneer said
that when he got news, he----

SIMON.The Jacoba came in after fifty-nine days' lost time.You are--You know more than you let on.Then it's time--I know more, eh?I'm holding off the ships by
ropes, eh?I warned you folks when that ship lay in the docks.What were
the words I spoke then, eh?All tales on your part for a glass
of gin!You was there, and the Miss was there.I says,
"The ship is rotten, that caulking was damn useless.That a floating
coffin like that"----

KAPS.Are
you so clever that when you're half drunk----

SIMON.Not drunk then, are you such an authority, you a shipmaster's
assistant, that when you say "no," and the owner and the Insurance
Company say "yes," my employer must put his ship in the dry docks?And now, I say--now, I say--that
if Mees, my daughter's betrothed, not to speak of the others, if
Mees--there will be murder.I'll be back in ten
minutes.[Goes back to his desk; the telephone rings.Mynheer
will be back in ten minutes.Mynheer Bos just went round the
corner.How lucky that outside of the children there were three
unmarried men on board.Or you'll break Meneer's
cigars.Kaps, do you want to make a guilder?I'm engaged to Bol, the skipper.He's lying here, with a load of peat for the city.I can't; because they don't know if my husband's dead.The legal limit is----

SAART.You must summons him, 'pro Deo,' three times in the papers and
if he doesn't come then, and that he'll not do, for there aren't any
more ghosts in the world, then you can----

SAART.Now, if you'd attend to this little matter, Bol and I would
always be grateful to you.When your common sense tells you
I haven't seen Jacob in three years and the----

[Cobus enters, trembling with agitation.]There must be tidings of the boys--of--of--the
Hope.Now, there is no use in your coming
to this office day after day.I haven't any good news to give you,
the bad you already know.Sixty-two days----

COB.Ach, ach, ach; Meneer Kaps,
help us out of this uncertainty.My sister--and my niece--are simply
insane with grief.My niece is sitting alone at home--my sister is at the Priest's,
cleaning house.There must be something--there must be something.The water bailiff's clerk said--said--Ach, dear God----[Off.]after that storm--all things
are possible.No, I wouldn't give a cent for it.If they had run into an English harbor, we would have
had tidings.[Laying her sketch book on Kaps's desk.]That's the way he was three months ago,
hale and jolly.No, Miss, I haven't the time.Daantje's death was a blow to him--you always saw them together,
always discussing.Now he hasn't a friend in the "Home"; that makes
a big difference.Well, that's Kneir, that's Barend with the basket on his back,
and that's--[The telephone bell rings.How long
will he be, Kaps?A hatch marked
47--and--[Trembling.][Screams and lets the
receiver fall.]I don't dare listen--Oh, oh!Barend?----Barend?----

CLEMENTINE.A telegram from Nieuwediep.A hatch--and a corpse----

[Enter Bos.]The water bailiff is on the 'phone.The water bailiff?--Step aside--Go along, you!I--I--[Goes timidly off.]A
telegram from Nieuwediep?47?--Well,
that's damned--miserable--that!the corpse--advanced stage of
decomposition!Barend--mustered in as oldest boy!by--oh!--The Expectation has come into Nieuwediep disabled?And
did Skipper Maatsuiker recognize him?So it isn't necessary to send any
one from here for the identification?Yes, damned sad--yes--yes--we
are in God's hand--Yes--yes--I no longer had any doubts--thank
you--yes--I'd like to get the official report as soon as possible.I
will inform the underwriters, bejour!I
never expected to hear of the ship again.Yes--yes--yes--yes--[To Clementine.]What stupidity to repeat what you heard in that woman's
presence.It won't be five minutes now till half the village is
here!You sit there, God save me, and take
on as if your lover was aboard----

CLEMENTINE.When Simon, the shipbuilder's assistant----

BOS.And if he hadn't been, what right have you to stick
your nose into matters you don't understand?Dear God, now I am also guilty----

BOS.Have the novels you read gone to
your head?Are you possessed, to use those words after such
an accident?He said that the ship was a floating coffin.Then I heard
you say that in any case it would be the last voyage for the Hope.That damned boarding school; those damned
boarding school fads!Walk if you like through the village like a fool,
sketching the first rascal or beggar you meet!But don't blab out
things you can be held to account for.Say, rather,
a drunken authority--The North, of Pieterse, and the Surprise and the
Willem III and the Young John.Half of the
fishing fleet and half the merchant fleet are floating coffins.No, Meneer, I don't hear anything.If you had asked me: "Father, how is this?"But you conceited young people meddle with everything and
more, too!What stronger proof is there than the yearly inspection of
the ships by the underwriters?Do you suppose that when I presently
ring up the underwriter and say to him, "Meneer, you can plank down
fourteen hundred guilders"--that he does that on loose grounds?You
ought to have a face as red as a buoy in shame for the way you flapped
out your nonsense!Nonsense; that might take away
my good name, if I wasn't so well known.If I were a ship owner--and I heard----

BOS.God preserve the fishery from an owner who makes drawings and
cries over pretty vases!I stand as a father at the head of a hundred
homes.When you get sensitive you go head over
heels.[Kaps makes a motion that he cannot hear.]The Burgomaster's wife is making a call.Willem Hengst, aged
thirty-seven, married, four children----

BOS.Wait a moment till my daughter----

CLEMENTINE.Jacob Zwart, aged thirty-five years, married,
three children.Gerrit Plas, aged twenty-five years, married, one
child.Geert Vermeer, unmarried, aged twenty-six years.Nellis Boom,
aged thirty-five years, married, seven children.Klaas Steen, aged
twenty-four years, married.Solomon Bergen, aged twenty-five years,
married, one child.Mari Stad, aged forty-five years, married.Barend Vermeer,
aged nineteen years.Pietje Stappers, aged twelve years.Ach, God; don't make me unhappy, Meneer!----

BOS.Stappers----

MARIETJE.You lie!--It isn't
possible!----

BOS.The Burgomaster at Nieuwediep has telegraphed the water
bailiff.Barend Vermeer was washed ashore.You know what that means,
and a hatch of the 47----

TRUUS.Oh, Mother Mary, must I lose that child, too?Oh,
oh, oh, oh!--Pietje--Pietje----

MARIETJE.Then--Then--[Bursts into a hysterical
laugh.]Hahaha!--Hahaha!----

BOS.[Striking the glass from Clementine's hand.][Falling on her knees, her hands catching hold of the railing
gate.]Let me die!--Let me die, please, dear God, dear God!Come Marietje, be calm; get up.And so brave; as he stood there, waving,
when the ship--[Sobs loudly.]There hasn't
been a storm like that in years.Think of Hengst with four children,
and Jacob and Gerrit--And, although it's no consolation, I will hand
you your boy's wages today, if you like.Both of you go home now and
resign yourselves to the inevitable--take her with you--she seems----

MARIETJE.I want to
die, die----

CLEMENTINE.Cry, Marietje, cry, poor lamb----

[They go off.]Are
you too lazy to put pen to paper today?Have you
the Widows' and Orphans' fund at hand?[Bos
throws him the keys.][Opens the safe, shuffles back
to Bos's desk with the book.]Ninety-five widows, fourteen old sailors and fishermen.Yes, the fund fell short some time ago.We will have to put in
another appeal.The Burgomaster's
wife asks if you will come in for a moment.Kaps, here is the copy for the circular.Talk to her about making a public appeal for the unfortunates.Yes, but, Clemens, isn't that overdoing it, two begging
parties?I will do it myself, then--[Both exit.][Goes to his desk
and sits down opposite to him.]I feel so miserable----

KAPS.The statement of
Veritas for October--October alone; lost, 105 sailing vessels and
30 steamships--that's a low estimate; fifteen hundred dead in one
month.Yes, when you see it as it appears
today, so smooth, with the floating gulls, you wouldn't believe that
it murders so many people.[To Jo and Cobus, who sit alone in a dazed way.]We have just run from home--for Saart just as I
said--just as I said----

[Enter Bos.]You stay
where you are, Cobus.You have no doubt heard?----

JO.It happens so often that
they get off in row boats.Not only was there a hatch,
but the corpse was in an extreme state of dissolution.Skipper Maatsuiker of the Expectation identified him, and the
earrings.And if--he should be mistaken----I've
come to ask you for money, Meneer, so I can go to the Helder myself.The Burgomaster of Nieuwediep will take care of that----

[Enter Simon.]I--I--heard----[Makes a strong gesture towards Bos.]I--I--have no evil
intentions----

BOS.Must that drunken
fellow----

SIMON.[Steadying himself by holding to the gate.]No--stay where
you are--I'm going--I--I--only wanted to say how nicely it came
out--with--with--The Good Hope.Don't come so close to me--never come so close to a man with
a knife----No-o-o-o--I have no bad intentions.I only wanted to say,
that I warned you--when--she lay in the docks.Now just for the joke of it--you ask--ask--ask your bookkeeper
and your daughter--who were there----

BOS.You're not worth an answer, you sot!My employer--doesn't do the caulking himself.[To Kaps, who
has advanced to the gate.]Didn't I warn him?--wasn't you there?No, I wasn't there, and even if I
was, I didn't hear anything.Did that drunken sot----

CLEMENTINE.As my daughter do you permit----[Grimly.]I don't remember----

SIMON.That's low--that's low--damned low!I said, the ship was
rotten--rotten----

BOS.You're trying to drag in my bookkeeper
and daughter, and you hear----

COB.Yes, but--yes, but--now I remember also----

BOS.But your daughter--your daughter
says now that she hadn't heard the ship was rotten.And on the second
night of the storm, when she was alone with me at my sister Kneirtje's,
she did say that--that----

CLEMENTINE.Did I--say----

COB.These are my own words
to you: "Now you are fibbing, Miss; for if your father knew the Good
Hope was rotten"----

JO.[Springing up wildly, speaking with piercing distinctness.]I
was there, and Truus was there, and----Oh, you adders!Who
gives you your feed, year in, year out?Haven't you decency enough to
believe us instead of that drunken beggar who reels as he stands there?You had Barend dragged on board by the police; Geert was too
proud to be taken!No,
no, you needn't point to your door!If I staid here
any longer I would spit in your face--spit in your face!For your Aunt's sake I will consider that you
are overwrought; otherwise--otherwise----The Good Hope was seaworthy,
was seaworthy!And even
had the fellow warned me--which is a lie, could I, a business man,
take the word of a drunkard who can no longer get a job because he
is unable to handle tools?I--I told you and him and her--that a floating
coffin like that.Geert and Barend and Mees and the
others![Sinks on the chair
sobbing.]Give me the money to go to Nieuwediep myself, then I won't
speak of it any more.A girl that talks to me as
rudely as you did----

JO.I don't know what I said--and--and--I don't
believe that you--that you--that you would be worse than the devil.The water-bailiff says that it isn't necessary to send any one
to Nieuwediep.What will
become of me now?----

[Cobus and Simon follow her out.]And you--don't you ever dare to set foot again
in my office.Father, I ask myself [Bursts into sobs.]She would be capable of ruining my good name--with
her boarding-school whims.Who ever comes now you send away,
understand?[Sound of Jelle's fiddle
outside.][Falls into his chair, takes
up Clementine's sketch book; spitefully turns the leaves; throws
it on the floor; stoops, jerks out a couple of leaves, tears them
up.Sits in thought a moment, then rings the telephone.]with
Dirksen--Dirksen, I say, the underwriter![Waits, looking
sombre.]It's all up with the
Good Hope.A hatch with my mark washed ashore and the body of a
sailor.I shall wait for you here at my office.[Rings off;
at the last words Kneirtje has entered.]I----[She sinks on the bench, patiently weeping.]Have you mislaid the
policies?You never put a damn thing in its place.The policies are higher, behind
the stocks.[Turning around
with the policies in his hand.]That hussy that
lives with you has been in here kicking up such a scandal that I came
near telephoning for the police.Is it true--is it true
that----The priest said----[Bos nods with a sombre expression.]Oh,
oh----[She stares helplessly, her arms hang limp.]I know you as a respectable woman--and
your husband too.I'm sorry to have to say it to you
now after such a blow, your children and that niece of yours have never
been any good.[Kneirtje's head sinks down.]How many years haven't
we had you around, until your son Geert threatened me with his fists,
mocked my grey hairs, and all but threw me out of your house--and your
other son----[Frightened.]Shall I call Mevrouw or your daughter?with long drawn out sobs,
sits looking before her with a dazed stare.][In an agonized voice, broken with sobs.]And with my own hands I loosened his
fingers from the door post.You have no cause to reproach yourself----

KNEIRTJE.Before he went I hung his
father's rings in his ears.Like--like a lamb to the slaughter----

BOS.Come----

KNEIRTJE.And my oldest boy that I didn't bid good
bye----"If you're too late"--these were his words--"I'll never look
at you again."in God's name, stop!----

KNEIRTJE.Twelve years ago--when the Clementine--I sat here as I am
now.[Sobs with her face between her trembling old hands.]Ach, poor, dear Kneir, I am so sorry for you.My husband and four sons----

MATHILDE.We have written an
appeal, the Burgomaster's wife and I, and it's going to be in all
the papers tomorrow.Here, Kaps----[Hands Kaps a sheet of paper which
he places on desk--Bos motions to her to go.]Let her wait a while,
Clemens.I have a couple of cold chops--that will brace
her up--and--and--let's make up with her.You have no objections
to her coming again to do the cleaning?We won't forget you, do you
hear?Now, my only hope is--my niece's child.She is with child by my
son----[Softly smiling.]No, that isn't a misfortune
now----

BOS.This immorality under your own
roof?Don't you know the rules of the fund, that no aid can be
extended to anyone leading an immoral life, or whose conduct does
not meet with our approval?I leave it to the gentlemen
themselves--to do for me--the gentlemen----

BOS.It will be a tussle with the Committee--the committee of the
fund--your son had been in prison and sang revolutionary songs.And
your niece who----However, I will do my best.I shall recommend
you, but I can't promise anything.There are seven new families,
awaiting aid, sixteen new orphans.My wife wants to give you something to take home
with you.[The bookkeeper rises, disappears
for a moment, and returns with a dish and an enamelled pan.]If you will return the dish when it's convenient,
and if you'll come again Saturday, to do the cleaning.He closes her nerveless hands about the dish and pan;
shuffles back to his stool.Kneirtje sits motionless,
in dazed agony; mumbles--moves her lips--rises with difficulty,
stumbles out of the office.]Appeal, for the
newspapers![Smiling sardonically, he comes to the foreground; leaning
on Bos's desk, he reads.]"Benevolent Fellow Countrymen: Again we
urge upon your generosity an appeal in behalf of a number of destitute
widows and orphans.The lugger Good Hope----[As he continues reading.]End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Good Hope, by Herman Heijermans, Jr.'A mere accident took me to St Charles,' he wrote
afterwards, 'and put me at the head of a revolting force.'Sir John Colborne, who was in command of the British military forces,
immediately {75} determined to disperse these gatherings by force and
to arrest their leaders.A force
consisting of one regiment of infantry, a troop of the Montreal
Volunteer Cavalry, and two light field-guns, under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Wetherall, had already been dispatched to Chambly by
way of the road on which the rescue of Demaray and Davignon had taken
place.Another force,
consisting of five companies of the 24th regiment, with a
twelve-pounder, under Colonel Charles Gore, a Waterloo veteran, would
proceed by boat to Sorel.There it was to be joined by one company of
the 66th regiment, then in garrison at Sorel, and the combined force
would march on St Denis.After having dispersed the rebels at St
Denis, which was thought not to be strongly held, the little army was
to proceed to St Charles, where it would be joined by the force under
Wetherall.At eight o'clock on the evening of November 22, Colonel Gore set out
with his men from the barrack-square at Sorel for St Denis.The
journey was one of eighteen miles; and in order to avoid St Ours, which
was held by the _Patriotes_, Gore turned away from the main {76} road
along the Richelieu to make a detour.This led his troops over very
bad roads.The night was dark and rain poured down in torrents.'I
got a lantern,' wrote one of Gore's aides-de-camp afterwards, 'fastened
it to the top of a pole, and had it carried in front of the column; but
what with horses and men sinking in the mud, harness breaking, wading
through water and winding through woods, the little force soon got
separated, those in the rear lost sight of the light, and great delays
and difficulties were experienced.Towards morning the rain changed to
snow, it became very cold, and daybreak found the unfortunate column
still floundering in the half-frozen mud four miles from St Denis.'Meanwhile word had reached the rebels of the coming of the soldiers.At daybreak Dr Wolfred Nelson had ridden out to reconnoitre, and had
succeeded in destroying several bridges.As the soldiers approached St
Denis they heard the church bells ringing the alarm; and it was not
long before they found that the village was strongly defended.After
capturing some of the houses on the outskirts of the village, they were
halted by a stockade built across the road covered by a large brick
house, well fortified on all sides.The commander of {77} the troops
brought reinforcements up to the firing line, and the twelve-pounder
came into action.But the assailants made very little impression on
the defence.Although the engagement lasted for more than five hours,
the troops succeeded in capturing nothing more than one of the flanking
houses.The ammunition of the British was running low, and the numbers
of the insurgents seemed to be increasing.Colonel Gore therefore
deemed it advisable to retire.By some strange oversight the British
were without any ambulance or transport of any kind; and they were
compelled to leave their dead and wounded behind them.Their
casualties were six killed and eighteen wounded.The wounded, it is a
pleasure to be able to say, were well looked after by the victorious
_Patriotes_.The British effected their retreat with great steadiness, despite the
fact that the men had had no food since the previous day and had been
marching all night.They were compelled to abandon their
twelve-pounder in the mud; but they reached St Ours that night without
further loss.The next day they were back at Sorel.The number of the insurgents at St Denis has never been accurately
ascertained; {78} probably they were considerably in excess of the
troops.Their position was one of great strength, and good judgment
had been shown in fortifying it.On the other hand, with the exception
of a few veterans of Major de Salaberry's Voltigeurs, they were
untrained in war; and their muskets and fowling-pieces were much
inferior to the rifles of the regulars.Their victory, it must be
said, reflected great credit upon them; although their losses had been
twice as great as those of the soldiers,[1] these peasants in homespun
had stood their ground with a courage and steadiness which would have
honoured old campaigners.The same, unfortunately, cannot be said
about some of their leaders.Papineau and O'Callaghan were present in
St Denis when the attack began; but before the morning was well
advanced, they had departed for St Hyacinthe, whence they later fled to
the United States.Papineau always declared that he had taken this
action at the {79} solicitation of Wolfred Nelson, who had said to him:
'Do not expose yourself uselessly: you will be of more service to us
after the fight than here.'In later days, however, when political
differences had arisen between the two men, Nelson denied having given
Papineau any such advice.But
even if Nelson did advise Papineau to leave, it cannot be said that
Papineau consulted his own reputation in accepting the advice.He was
not a person without military experience: he had been a major in the
militia, and was probably superior in rank to any one in the village.His place was with the brave farmers who had taken up arms on his
behalf.An episode in connection with the attack on St Denis left a dark stain
on the _Patriote_ escutcheon and embittered greatly the relations
between the two races in Canada.This was the murder, on the morning
of the fight, of Lieutenant Weir, a subaltern in the 32nd regiment, who
had been sent with dispatches to Sorel by land.He had reached Sorel
half an hour after Colonel Gore and his men had departed for St Denis.In attempting to catch up with Gore's column he had taken the direct
road to St Denis and had arrived there {80} in advance of the British
troops.On approaching the village he was arrested, and by Wolfred
Nelson's orders placed in detention.As the British attack developed,
it was thought better by those who had him in charge to remove him to
St Charles.They bound him tightly and placed him in a wagon.Hardly
had they started when he made an attempt to escape.In this emergency
his warders seem to have lost their heads.In spite of the fact that
Weir was tightly bound and could do no harm, they fell upon him with
swords and pistols, and in a short time dispatched him.Then, appalled
at what they had done, they attempted to hide the body.When the
British troops entered St Denis a week later, they found the body
lying, weighted down with stones, in the Richelieu river under about
two feet of water.The autopsy disclosed the brutality with which Weir
had been murdered; and the sight of the body so infuriated the soldiers
that they gave the greater part of the village of St Denis to the
flames.In the later phases of the rebellion the slogan of the British
soldiers was, 'Remember Jack Weir.'Another atrocious murder even more unpardonable than that of Weir was
perpetrated {81} a few days later.On November 28 some _Patriotes_
near St Johns captured a man by the name of Chartrand, who was enlisted
in a loyal volunteer corps of the district.After a mock trial
Chartrand was tied to a tree and shot by his own countrymen.[1] According to a report twelve _Patriotes_ lost their lives during
the engagement.Among them was Charles Ovide Perrault, member of the
Assembly for Vaudreuil, a young barrister of considerable promise.He
seems to have been Papineau's closest follower and confidant During the
last sessions of the Lower Canada legislature Perrault contributed many
letters to _La Minerve_.{82}

CHAPTER IX

_FORCE MAJEURE_

The check administered to Colonel Gore's column at St Denis, in the
first engagement of the rebellion, was the only victory which fell to
the rebel forces.In the meantime Lieutenant-Colonel Wetherall, with
several companies of infantry, a troop of volunteer cavalry, and two
field-guns, was marching on St Charles.On the evening of November 22
Major Gugy, the leader of the English party in the Assembly, had
brought to Wetherall at Chambly instructions to advance down the
Richelieu and attack the rebel position at St Charles in the morning.He set out accordingly at about the hour when Gore headed his forces up
the river from Sorel.But, while Gore carried out his orders to the
letter and reached St Denis on the morning of the 23rd, Wetherall
allowed himself some latitude in interpreting his instructions.This
was largely due to the advice of Gugy, if we are to believe {83} the
account which Gugy has left us.'In the first place,' it runs, 'not
one of the force knew anything of the roads or people, nor do I believe
that more than one spoke French....  The storm raged so fearfully, the
rain poured in such torrents, and the frost set in afterwards so
intensely, that... men and horses were equally fatigued... all so
exhausted as to be unable to cope, on broken or woody ground,
successfully with any resolute enemy....  I learned that we had marched
without a dollar, without a loaf of bread, without a commissary, and
without a spare cartridge--a pretty predicament in an enemy's country,
surrounded by thousands of armed men.'It was apparent to Gugy that
Sir John Colborne, in issuing his orders, had greatly underestimated
the difficulty of the task he was setting for the troops.After
crossing the river above the Chambly Basin, Gugy therefore induced
Wetherall to halt until daylight; and, turning himself into a
commissary, he billeted the men and horses in the neighbouring houses
and stables.The next day about noon the column reached St Hilaire, some seven miles
from St Charles.Here Wetherall obtained information which led him to
fear that Gore {84} had met with some kind of check; and he was
persuaded to send back to Chambly for a reinforcement of one company
which had been left in garrison there.His messenger reached Chambly
at four o'clock on the morning of the 24th.Major Warde, the
commandant at Chambly, at once embarked his company on a scow and
dropped down the river to St Hilaire; but he arrived too late to allow
of any further action that day, and it was not until the morning of the
25th that the column moved on St Charles.Meanwhile, the rebels had been making preparations for defence.They
had fortified the manor-house of Debartzch, who had fled to Montreal,
and built round it a rampart of earth and tree-trunks--a rampart which,
for some mysterious reason, was never completed.They appointed as
commander Thomas Storrow Brown, a Montreal iron-merchant, for whose
arrest a warrant had been issued and who had fled to St Charles with
two or three other _Patriote_ politicians.But Brown had no military
experience, and was still suffering so severely from injuries received
in the rioting in Montreal that his proper place was a home for
convalescents rather than a field of battle.His appointment can only
be {85} explained by the non-appearance of the local _Patriote_
leaders.'The chief men,' Brown testified afterwards, 'were, with two
or three exceptions, absent or hiding.'It is evident that the British
authorities expected to meet with the strongest opposition at St
Charles, since that place had been the scene of the great demonstration
earlier in the year.But, as a matter of fact, the rebel forces at St
Charles were much less formidable than those at St Denis.Not only
were they lacking in proper military leadership; they were also fewer
in number and were, moreover, very inadequately armed.If Brown's
statements are to be relied upon, there were not in the rebel camp two
hundred men.'Of ammunition,' wrote Brown, 'we had some half dozen
kegs of gunpowder and a little lead, which was cast into bullets; but
as the fire-arms were of every calibre, the cartridges made were too
large for many, which were consequently useless.We had two small
rusty field-pieces, but with neither carriages nor appointments they
were as useless as two logs.There was one old musket, but not a
bayonet.The fire-arms were common flintlocks, in all conditions of
dilapidation, some tied together with string, and very many with {86}
lock-springs so worn out that they could not be discharged.'On the 24th Brown made a reconnaissance in the direction of St Hilaire.He destroyed a bridge over a ravine some distance to the south of St
Charles, and placed above it an outpost with orders to prevent a
reconstruction of the bridge.But when the British troops appeared on
the morning of the 25th, this and other outlying pickets fell back
without making any resistance.They probably saw that they were so
outnumbered that resistance would be hopeless.On the approach of the
troops Brown at first assumed an attitude of confidence.A messenger
came from Wetherall, 'a respectable old habitant,' to tell the rebels
that if they dispersed quietly, they would not be molested.Brown
treated the message as a confession of weakness.'I at once supposed,'
he said, 'that, followed in the rear by our friends from above, they
were seeking a free passage to Sorel, and determined to send a message,
that _if they would lay down their arms, they should pass unmolested_.'This message does not seem to have reached its destination.And hardly
had the engagement opened when Brown quickly changed his tune.'To go
forward {87} was useless, as I could order nothing but a
retreat--without it the people commenced retiring.I tried to rally
the little squads, my only hope being in keeping together the
fowling-pieces we had collected, but finding, after a long trial, my
strength and authority insufficient, I considered my command gone,
turned my horse, and rode to... St Denis (seven or eight miles), where
... I arrived about nightfall.'The rebels, or at any rate
those of them who were armed, seem to have been outnumbered by the
soldiers, of whom there were between three and four hundred.But the
fighting was apparently brisk while it lasted.The British lost three
killed and eighteen wounded.The _Patriote_ losses are not known.The
local tradition is that forty-two were killed and many more wounded.We know that thirty were taken prisoners on the field.The defeat of the rebels at St Charles really terminated the rebellion
in the country about the Richelieu.When news of the defeat spread
over the countryside, the _Patriote_ forces immediately disbanded, and
their leaders sought safety in flight.Papineau and O'Callaghan, who
had been at St Hyacinthe, {88} succeeded in getting across the Vermont
border; but Wolfred Nelson was not so fortunate.After suffering great
privations he was captured by some loyalist militia not far from the
frontier, taken to Montreal, and there lodged in prison.For some reason which it is difficult to discern, Wetherall did not
march on from St Charles to effect a pacification of St Denis.On
December 1, however, Colonel Gore once more set out from Sorel, and
entered St Denis the same day.He
recovered the howitzer and five of the wounded men he had left behind.In spite of the absence of opposition, his men took advantage of the
occasion to wreak an unfair and un-British vengeance on the helpless
victors of yesterday.Goaded to fury by the sight of young Weir's
mangled body, they set fire to a large part of the village.Colonel
Gore afterwards repudiated the charge that he had ordered the burning
of the houses of the insurgents; but that defence does not absolve him
from blame.It is obvious, at any rate, that he did not take adequate
measures to prevent such excesses; nor was any punishment ever
administered to those who applied the torch.{89}

But the end of rebellion was not yet in sight.Two more encounters
remain to be described.The first of these occurred at a place known
as Moore's Corners, near the Vermont border.After the collapse at St
Charles a number of _Patriote_ refugees had gathered at the small town
of Swanton, a few miles south of Missisquoi Bay, on the American side
of the boundary-line.Among them were Dr Cyrile Cote and Edouard
Rodier, both members of the Lower Canada Assembly; Ludger Duvernay, a
member of the Assembly and editor of _La Minerve_; Dr Kimber, one of
the ringleaders in the rescue of Demaray and Davignon; and Robert Shore
Milnes Bouchette, the descendant of a French-Canadian family long
conspicuous for its loyalty and its services to the state.Bouchette's
grandfather had been instrumental in effecting the escape of Sir Guy
Carleton from Montreal in 1775, when that place was threatened by the
forces of Montgomery.The grandson's social tastes and affiliations
might have led one to expect that he would have been found in the ranks
of the loyalists; but the arbitrary policy of the Russell Resolutions
had driven him into the arms of the extreme _Patriotes_.Arrested for
disloyalty at the outbreak of {90} the rebellion, he had been admitted
to bail and had escaped.These men, under the belief that the
habitants would rise and join them, determined upon an armed invasion
of Canada.Possibly they believed also that Wolfred Nelson was still
holding out.Papineau, it was said, had reported that 'the victor of
St Denis' was entrenched with a considerable force at St Cesaire on the
Yamaska.They therefore collected arms and ammunition, sent emissaries
through the parishes to the north to rouse the _Patriotes_, and on
December 6, flying some colours which had been worked for them by the
enthusiastic ladies of Swanton, they crossed the Canadian border, about
two hundred strong.They had two field-pieces and a supply of muskets
and ammunition for those whom they expected to join the party on
Canadian soil.Hardly had the invaders crossed the border when they encountered at
Moore's Corners a body of the Missisquoi Volunteers, under the command
of Captain Kemp, who were acting as escort to a convoy of arms and
ammunition.Having received warning of the coming of the insurgents,
Kemp had sent out messengers through the countryside to rouse the
loyalist {91} population.To these as they arrived he served out the
muskets in his wagons.And when the rebels appeared, about eight
o'clock at night, he had a force at his disposal of at least three
hundred men, all well armed.There is reason for believing that Kemp might have succeeded in
ambushing the advancing force, had not some of his men, untrained
volunteers with muskets in their hands for the first time, opened fire
prematurely.The rebels returned the fire, and a fusillade continued
for ten or fifteen minutes.But the rebels, on perceiving that they
had met a superior force, retired in great haste, leaving behind them
one dead and two wounded.One of the wounded was Bouchette, who had
been in command of the advance-guard.The rebels abandoned also their
two field-pieces, about forty stand of arms, five kegs of gunpowder,
and six boxes of ball-cartridge, as well as two standards.Among the
loyalists there were no casualties whatever.Only three of the rebels
were taken prisoner besides the two wounded, a fact which Kemp
explained by several factors--the undisciplined state of the loyalists,
the darkness of the night, the vicinity of woods, and the proximity of
the boundary-line, {92} beyond which he did not allow the pursuit to
go.The 'battle' of Moore's Corners was in truth an excellent farce;
but there is no doubt that it prevented what might have been a more
serious encounter had the rebel column reached the neighbourhood of St
Johns, where many of the _Patriotes_ were in readiness to join them.A few days later, in a part of the province some distance removed from
the Richelieu river and the Vermont border, there occurred another
collision, perhaps the most formidable of the whole rebellion.This
was at the village of St Eustache, in the county of Two Mountains,
about eighteen miles north-west of Montreal.The county of Two
Mountains had long been known as a stronghold of the extreme
_Patriotes_.The local member, W. H. Scott, was a supporter of
Papineau, and had a large and enthusiastic following.He was not,
however, a leader in the troubles that ensued.The chief organizer of
revolt in St Eustache and the surrounding country was a mysterious
adventurer named Amury Girod, who arrived in St Eustache toward the end
of November with credentials, it would seem from Papineau, assigning to
him the task of superintending the _Patriote_ cause {93} in the north.He is variously described as having
been a Swiss, an Alsatian, and a native of Louisiana.According to his
own statement, he had been at one time a lieutenant-colonel of cavalry
in Mexico.He was well educated, could speak fluently several
languages, had a bold and plausible manner, and succeeded in imposing,
not only upon the _Patriote_ leaders, but upon the people of St
Eustache.He found a capable and dauntless supporter in Dr J. O.
Chenier, the young physician of the village.Chenier was one of the
few leaders of the revolt whose courage challenges admiration; and it
is fitting that to-day a monument, bearing the simple inscription
CHENIER, should stand in the Place Viger in Montreal, among the people
for whom, though misguidedly and recklessly, he laid down his life.To St Eustache, on Sunday, November 26, came the news of Wolfred
Nelson's victory at St Denis.On Monday and Tuesday bands of
_Patriotes_ went about the countryside, terrorizing and disarming the
loyalists and compelling the faint-hearted to join in the rising.On
Wednesday night the rebels gathered to the number of about four hundred
{94} in St Eustache, and got noisily drunk (_s'y enivrerent
bruyamment_).They then proceeded, under the command of Girod and
Chenier, to the Indian mission settlement at the Lake of Two Mountains.Here they broke into the government stores and possessed themselves of
some guns and ammunition.They next made themselves unwelcome to the
superior of the mission, the Abbe Dufresne, and, in spite of his
protestations, carried off from the mission-house a three-pounder gun.On their return to St Eustache they forcibly entered the convent which
had been lately completed, though it was not yet occupied, and camped
there.The loyalists who were forced to flee from the village carried the news
of these proceedings to Montreal; but Sir John Colborne was unwilling
to take any steps to subdue the _Patriotes_ of St Eustache until the
insurrection on the Richelieu had been thoroughly crushed.All he did
was to send a detachment of volunteers to guard the Bord a Plouffe
bridge at the northern end of the island of Montreal.On Sunday, December 3, word reached St Eustache of the defeat of the
insurgents at St Charles.This had a moderating influence on many of
the _Patriotes_.All week the Abbe {95} Paquin, parish priest of St
Eustache, had been urging the insurgents to go back quietly to their
homes.He begged Chenier to cease
his revolutionary conduct.Chenier, however, was immovable.He
refused to believe that the rebels at St Charles had been dispersed,
and announced his determination to die with arms in his hands rather
than surrender.'You might as well try to seize the moon with your
teeth,' he exclaimed, 'as to try to shake my resolve.'The events of the days that followed cannot be chronicled in detail.When the Abbe Paquin and his vicar Deseves sought to leave the parish,
Girod and Chenier virtually placed them under arrest.The abbe did not
mince matters with Chenier.'I accuse you before God and man,' he
said, 'of being the author of these misfortunes.'When some of the
habitants came to him complaining that they had been forced against
their will to join the rebels, he reminded them of the English proverb:
'You may lead a horse to the water, but you cannot make him drink.'Unfortunately, the Abbe Paquin's good influence was counteracted by
that of the Abbe Chartier, the cure of the neighbouring village of St
{96} Benoit, a rare case of an ecclesiastic lending his support to the
rebel movement, in direct contravention of the orders of his superiors.On several occasions the Abbe Chartier came over to St Eustache and
delivered inflammatory addresses to the rebel levies.The vicar Deseves has left us a vivid picture of the life which the
rebels led.No attempt was made to drill them or to exercise
discipline.He continually saw them,
he says, passing through the village in knots of five or six, carrying
rusty guns out of order, smoking short black pipes, and wearing blue
_tuques_ which hung half-way down their backs, clothes of _etoffe du
pays_, and leather mittens.They helped themselves to all the strong
drink they could lay their hands on, and their gait showed the
influence of their potations.Their chief aim in life seemed to be to
steal, to drink, to eat, to dance, and to quarrel.With regard to the
morrow, they lived in a fool's paradise.They seem to have believed
that the troops would not dare to come out to meet them, and that when
their leaders should give the word they would advance on Montreal and
take it without difficulty.Their numbers during this period showed a
good deal of {97} fluctuation.Ultimately Girod succeeded in gathering
about him nearly a thousand men.Not all these, however, were armed;
according to Deseves a great many of them had no weapons but sticks and
stones.By December 13 Sir John Colborne was ready to move.He had provided
himself with a force strong enough to crush an enemy several times more
numerous than the insurgents led by Girod and Chenier.His column was
composed of the 1st Royals, the 32nd regiment, the 83rd regiment, the
Montreal Volunteer Rifles, Globensky and Leclerc's Volunteers, a strong
force of cavalry--in all, over two thousand men, supported by eight
pieces of field artillery and well supplied with provision and
ammunition transport.The troops bivouacked for the night at St Martin, and advanced on the
morning of the 14th.The main body crossed the Mille Isles river on
the ice about four miles to the east of St Eustache, and then moved
westward along the St Rose road.A detachment of Globensky's
Volunteers, however, followed the direct road to St Eustache, and came
out on the south side of the river opposite the village, in full view
of the rebels.Chenier, at the head of a hundred and fifty men,
crossed the {98} ice, and was on the point of coming to close quarters
with the volunteers when the main body of the loyalists appeared to the
east.Thereupon Chenier and his men beat a hasty retreat, and made
hurried preparations for defending the village.The church, the
convent, the presbytery, and the house of the member of the Assembly,
Scott, were all occupied and barricaded.It was about the church that
the fiercest fighting took place.The artillery was brought to bear on
the building; but the stout masonry resisted the battering of the
cannon balls, and is still standing, dinted and scarred.Some of the
Royals then got into the presbytery and set fire to it.Under cover of
the smoke the rest of the regiment then doubled up the street to the
church door.Gaining access through the sacristy, they lit a fire
behind the altar.'The firing from the church windows then ceased,'
wrote one of the officers afterwards, 'and the rebels began running out
from some low windows, apparently of a crypt or cellar.Our men formed
up on one side of the church, and the 32nd and 83rd on the other.Some
of the rebels ran out and fired at the troops, then threw down their
arms and begged for quarter.Our officers tried to save the {99}
Canadians, but the men shouted "Remember Jack Weir," and numbers of
these poor deluded fellows were shot down.'He had jumped from a window of the
Blessed Virgin's chapel and was making for the cemetery.How many fell
with him it is difficult to say.It was said that seventy rebels were
killed, and a number of charred bodies were found afterwards in the
ruins of the church.The casualties among the troops were slight, one
killed and nine wounded.One of the wounded was Major Gugy, who here
distinguished himself by his bravery and kind-heartedness, as he had
done in the St Charles expedition.A good
many, indeed, had fled from the village on the first appearance of the
troops.Among these were some who had played a conspicuous part in
fomenting trouble.The Abbe Chartier of St Benoit, instead of waiting
to administer the last rites to the dying, beat a feverish retreat and
eventually escaped to the United States.The Church placed on him its
interdict, and he never again set foot on Canadian soil.The behaviour
of the adventurer Girod, the 'general' of the rebel force, was
especially {100} reprehensible.When he had posted his men in the
church and the surrounding buildings, he mounted a horse and fled
toward St Benoit.At a tavern where he stopped to get a stiff draught
of spirits he announced that the rebels had been victorious and that he
was seeking reinforcements with which to crush the troops completely.Then, finding that the cordon was
tightening around him, he blew out his brains with a revolver.Thus
ended a life which was not without its share of romance and mystery.On the night of the 14th the troops encamped near the desolate village
of St Eustache, a large part of which had unfortunately been given over
to the flames during the engagement.In the morning the column set out
for St Benoit.Sir John Colborne had threatened that if a single shot
were fired from St Benoit the village would be given over to fire and
pillage.But when the troops arrived there they found awaiting them
about two hundred and fifty men bearing white flags.All the villagers
laid down their arms and made an unqualified submission.And it is a
matter for profound regret that, notwithstanding this, the greater part
of the village {101} was burned to the ground.Sir John Colborne has
been severely censured for this occurrence, and not without reason.Nothing is more certain, of course, than that he did not order it.It
seems to have been the work of the loyalist volunteers, who had without
doubt suffered much at the hands of the rebels.'The irregular troops
employed,' wrote one of the British officers, 'were not to be
controlled, and were in every case, I believe, the instrument of the
infliction.'Far too much burning and pillaging went on, indeed, in
the wake of the rebellion.'You know,' wrote an inhabitant of St
Benoit to a friend in Montreal, 'where the younger Arnoldi got his
supply of butter, or where another got the guitar he carried back with
him from the expedition about the neck.'And it is probable that the
British officers, and perhaps Sir John Colborne himself, winked at some
things which they could not officially recognize.At any rate, it is
impossible to acquit Colborne of all responsibility for the unsoldierly
conduct of the men under his command.It is usual to regard the rebellion of 1837 in Lower Canada as no less
a fiasco than its counterpart in Upper Canada.There is no doubt that
it was hopeless from the outset.{102} It was an impromptu movement,
based upon a sudden resolution rather than on a well-reasoned plan of
action.Most of the leaders--Wolfred Nelson, Thomas Storrow Brown,
Robert Bouchette, and Amury Girod--were strangers to the men under
their command; and none of them, save Chenier, seemed disposed to fight
to the last ditch.The movement at its inception fell under the
official ban of the Church; and only two priests, the cures of St
Charles and St Benoit, showed it any encouragement.The actual
rebellion was confined to the county of Two Mountains and the valley of
the Richelieu.The districts of Quebec and Three Rivers were quiet as
the grave--with the exception, perhaps, of an occasional village like
Montmagny, where Etienne P. Tache, afterwards a colleague of Sir John
Macdonald and prime minister of Canada, was the centre of a local
agitation.Yet it is easy to see that the rebellion might have been
much more serious.But for the loyal attitude of the ecclesiastical
authorities, and the efforts of many clear-headed parish priests like
the Abbe Paquin of St Eustache, the revolutionary leaders might have
been able to consummate their plans, and Sir John Colborne, with the
small number of troops at {103} his disposal, might have found it
difficult to keep the flag flying.The rebellion was easily snuffed
out because the majority of the French-Canadian people, in obedience to
the voice of their Church, set their faces against it.{104}

CHAPTER X

THE LORD HIGH COMMISSIONER

The rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada profoundly affected public
opinion in the mother country.That the first year of the reign of the
young Queen Victoria should have been marred by an armed revolt in an
important British colony shocked the sensibilities of Englishmen and
forced the country and the government to realize that the grievances of
the Canadian Reformers were more serious than they had imagined.It
was clear that the old system of alternating concession and repression
had broken down and that the situation demanded radical action.The
Melbourne government suspended the constitution of Lower Canada for
three years, and appointed the Earl of Durham as Lord High
Commissioner, with very full powers, to go out to Canada to investigate
the grievances and to report on a remedy.John George Lambton, the first Earl of {105} Durham, was a wealthy and
powerful Whig nobleman, of decided Liberal, if not Radical, leanings.He had taken no small part in the framing of the Reform Bill of 1832,
and at one time he had been hailed by the English Radicals or Chartists
as their coming leader.It was therefore expected that he would be
decently sympathetic with the Reform movements in the Canadas.At the
same time, Melbourne and his ministers were only too glad to ship him
out of the country.There was no question of his great ability and
statesmanlike outlook.But his advanced Radical views were distasteful
to many of his former colleagues; and his arrogant manners, his lack of
tact, and his love of pomp and circumstance made him unpopular even in
his own party.The truth is that he was an excellent leader to work
under, but a bad colleague to work with.The Melbourne government had
first got rid of him by sending him to St Petersburg as ambassador
extraordinary; and then, on his return from St Petersburg, they got him
out of the way by sending him to Canada.He was at first loath to go,
mainly on the ground of ill health; but at the personal intercession of
the young queen he accepted the commission offered him.It was {106}
an evil day for himself, but a good day for Canada, when he did so.Durham arrived in Quebec, with an almost regal retinue, on May 28,
1838.Gosford, who had remained in Canada throughout the rebellion,
had gone home at the end of February; and the administration had been
taken over by Sir John Colborne, the commander-in-chief of the forces.As soon as the news of the suspension of the constitution reached Lower
Canada, Sir John Colborne appointed a provisional special council of
twenty-two members, half of them French and half of them English, to
administer the affairs of the province until Lord Durham should arrive.The first official act of Lord Durham in the colony swept this council
out of existence.'His Excellency believes,' the members of the
council were told, 'that it is as much the interest of you all, as for
the advantage of his own mission, that his administrative conduct
should be free from all suspicions of political influence or party
feeling; that it should rest on his own undivided responsibility, and
that when he quits the Province, he should leave none of its permanent
residents in any way committed by the acts which his Government may
have {107} found it necessary to perform, during the temporary
suspension of the Constitution.'In its place he appointed a small
council of five members, all but one from his own staff.The one
Canadian called to this council was Dominick Daly, the provincial
secretary, whom Colborne recommended as being unidentified with any
political party.The first great problem with which Lord Durham and his council had to
deal was the question of the political prisoners, numbers of whom were
still lying in the prisons of Montreal.Sir John Colborne had not
attempted to decide what should be done with them, preferring to shift
this responsibility upon Lord Durham.It would probably have been much
better to have settled the matter before Lord Durham set foot in the
colony, so that his mission might not have been handicapped at the
outset with so thorny a problem; but it is easy to follow Colborne's
reasoning.In the first place, he did not bring the prisoners to trial
because no Lower-Canadian jury at that time could have been induced to
convict them, a reasonable inference from the fact that the murder of
Weir had gone unavenged, even as the murderers of Chartrand were to be
acquitted {108} by a jury a few months later.In the second place,
Colborne had not the power to deal with the prisoners summarily.Moreover, most of the rebel leaders had not been captured.The only
three prisoners of much importance were Wolfred Nelson, Robert
Bouchette, and Bonaventure Viger.The rest of the _Patriote_ leaders
were scattered far and wide.Chenier and Girod lay beneath the
springing sod; Papineau, O'Callaghan, Storrow Brown, Robert Nelson,
Cote, and Rodier were across the American border; Morin had just come
out of his hiding-place in the Canadian backwoods; and LaFontaine,
after vainly endeavouring, on the outbreak of rebellion, to get Gosford
to call together the legislature of Lower Canada, had gone abroad.The
future course of the rebels who had fled to the United States was still
doubtful; there was a strong probability that they might create further
disturbances.And, while the situation was still unsettled, Colborne
thought it better to leave the fate of the prisoners to be decided by
Durham.Durham's instructions were to temper justice with mercy.His own
instincts were apparently in favour of a complete amnesty; but he
supposed it necessary to make an {109} example of some of the leaders.After earnest deliberation and consultation with his council, and
especially with his chief secretary, Charles Buller, the friend and
pupil of Thomas Carlyle, Durham determined to grant to the rebels a
general amnesty, with only twenty-four exceptions.Eight of the men
excepted were political prisoners who had been prominent in the revolt
and who had confessed their guilt and had thrown themselves on the
mercy of the Lord High Commissioner; the remaining sixteen were rebel
leaders who had fled from the country.Durham gave orders that the
eight prisoners should be transported to the Bermudas during the
queen's pleasure.The sixteen refugees were forbidden to return to
Canada under penalty of death without benefit of clergy.No one can fail to see that this course was dictated by the humanest
considerations.A criminal rebellion had terminated without the
shedding judicially of a drop of blood.Lord Durham even took care
that the eight prisoners should not be sent to a convict colony.The
only criticism directed against his course in Canada was on the ground
of its excessive lenity.Wolfred Nelson and Robert Bouchette had
certainly suffered a milder fate {110} than that of Samuel Lount and
Peter Matthews, who had been hanged in Upper Canada for rebellion.Yet
when the news of Durham's action reached England, it was immediately
attacked as arbitrary and unconstitutional.The assault was opened by
Lord Brougham, a bitter personal enemy of Lord Durham.In the House of
Lords Brougham contended that Durham had had no right to pass sentence
on the rebel prisoners and refugees when they had not been brought to
trial; and that he had no right to order them to be transported to, and
held in, Bermuda, where his authority did not run.In this attitude he
was supported by the Duke of Wellington, the leader of the Tory party.Wellington's name is one which is usually remembered with honour in the
history of the British Empire; but on this occasion he did not think it
beneath him to play fast and loose with the interests of Canada for the
sake of a paltry party advantage.It would have been easy for him to
recognize the humanity of Durham's policy, and to join with the
government in legislating away any technical illegalities that may have
existed in Durham's ordinance; but Wellington could not resist the
temptation to embarrass the Whig {111} administration, regardless of
the injury which he might be doing to the sorely tried people of Canada.The Melbourne administration, which had sent Durham to Canada, might
have been expected to stand behind him when he was attacked.Lord John
Russell, indeed, rose in the House of Commons and made a thoroughgoing
defence of Durham's policy as 'wise and statesmanlike.'But he alone
of the ministers gave Durham loyal support.In the House of Lords
Melbourne contented himself with a feeble defence of Durham and then
capitulated to the Opposition.Nothing would have been easier for him
than to introduce a bill making valid whatever may have been irregular
in Durham's ordinance; but instead of that he disallowed the ordinance,
and passed an Act of Indemnity for all those who had had a part in
carrying it out.Without waiting to hear Durham's defence, or to
consult with him as to the course which should be followed, the Cabinet
weakly surrendered to an attack of his personal enemies.Durham was
betrayed in the house of his friends.The news of the disallowance of the ordinance first reached Durham
through the columns of an American newspaper.{112} Immediately his
mind was made up.Without waiting for any official notification, he
sent in his resignation to the colonial secretary.He was quite
satisfied himself that he had not exceeded his powers.'Until I
learn,' he wrote, 'from some one better versed in the English language
that despotism means anything but such an aggregation of the supreme
executive and legislative authority in a single head, as was
deliberately made by Parliament in the Act which constituted my powers,
I shall not blush to hear that I have exercised a despotism; I shall
feel anxious only to know how well and wisely I have used, or rather
exhibited an intention of using, my great powers.'But he felt that if
he could expect no firm support from the Melbourne government, his
usefulness was gone, and resignation was the only course open to him.He wrote, however, that he intended to remain in Canada until he had
completed the inquiries he had instituted.In view of the 'lamentable
want of information' with regard to Canada which existed in the
Imperial parliament, he confessed that he 'would take shame to himself
if he left his inquiry incomplete.'A few days before Durham left Canada he took the unusual and, under
ordinary {113} circumstances, unconstitutional course of issuing a
proclamation, in which he explained the reasons for his resignation,
and in effect appealed from the action of the home government to
Canadian public opinion.It was this proclamation which drew down on
him from _The Times_ the nickname of 'Lord High Seditioner.'The
wisdom of the proclamation was afterwards, however, vigorously defended
by Charles Duller.The general unpopularity of the British government,
Duller explained, was such in Canada that a little more or less could
not affect it; whereas it was a matter of vital importance that the
angry and suspicious colonists should find one British statesman with
whom they could agree.The real justification of the proclamation lay
in the magical effect which it had upon the public temper.The news
that the ordinance had been disallowed, and that the whole question of
the political prisoners had been once more thrown into the melting-pot,
had greatly excited the public mind; and the proclamation fell like oil
upon the troubled waters.'No disorder, no increase of disaffection
ensued; on the contrary, all parties in the Province expressed a
revival of confidence.'Lord Durham left Quebec on November 1, {114} 1838.'It was a sad day
and a sad departure,' wrote Buller.The
spectators filled every window and every house-top, and, though every
hat was raised as we passed, a deep silence marked the general grief
for Lord Durham's departure.'Durham had been in Canada only five
short months.Yet in that time he had gained a knowledge of, and an
insight into, the Canadian situation such as no other governor of
Canada had possessed.The permanent monument of that insight is, of
course, his famous _Report on the Affairs of British North America_,
issued by the Colonial Office in 1839.This is no place to write at
length about that greatest of all documents ever published with regard
to colonial affairs.In the _Report_
Lord Durham rightly diagnosed the evils of the body politic in Canada.He traced the rebellion to two causes, in the main: first, racial
feeling; and, secondly, that 'union of representative and irresponsible
government' of which he said that it was difficult to understand how
any English statesman ever imagined that such a system would work.And
yet one of the two chief remedies which he recommended seemed like a
death sentence passed on the French in Canada.{115} This was the
proposal for the legislative union of Upper and Lower Canada with the
avowed object of anglicizing by absorption the French population.This
suggestion certainly did not promote racial peace.The other proposal,
that of granting to the Canadian people responsible government in all
matters not infringing'strictly imperial interests,' blazed the trail
leading out of the swamps of pre-rebellion politics.In one respect only is Lord Durham's _Report_ seriously faulty: it is
not fair to French Canadians.'They cling,' wrote Durham, 'to ancient
prejudices, ancient customs, and ancient laws, not from any strong
sense of their beneficial effects, but with the unreasoning tenacity of
an uneducated and unprogressive people.'To their racial and
nationalist ambitions he was far from favourable.'The error,' he
contended, 'to which the present contest is to be attributed is the
vain endeavour to preserve a French-Canadian nationality in the midst
of Anglo-American colonies and states'; and he quoted with seeming
approval the statement of one of the Lower Canada 'Bureaucrats' that
'Lower Canada must be _English_, at the expense, if necessary, of not
being _British_.'His primary {116} object in recommending the union
of the two Canadas, to place the French in a minority in the united
province, was surely a mistaken policy.Lord Elgin, a far wiser statesman, who completed Durham's
work by introducing the substance of responsible government which the
_Report_ recommended, decidedly opposed anything in the nature of a
gradual crusade against French-Canadian nationalism.'I for one,' he
wrote, 'am deeply convinced of the impolicy of all such attempts to
denationalize the French.Generally speaking, they produce the
opposite effect, causing the flame of national prejudice and animosity
to burn more fiercely.But suppose them to be successful, what would
be the result?You may perhaps _Americanize_, but, depend upon it, by
methods of this description you will never _Anglicize_ the French
inhabitants of the province.Let them feel, on the other hand, that
their religion, their habits, their prepossessions, their prejudices if
you will, are more considered and respected here than in other portions
of this vast continent, and who will venture to say that the last hand
which waves the British flag on American ground may not be that of a
French Canadian?'{117}

CHAPTER XI

THE SECOND REBELLION

The frigate _Inconstant_, with Lord Durham on board, was not two days
out from Quebec when rebellion broke out anew in Lower Canada.This
second rebellion, however, was not caused by Lord Durham's departure,
but was the result of a long course of agitation which had been carried
on along the American border throughout the months of Lord Durham's
regime.As early as February 1838 numbers of Canadian refugees had gathered in
the towns on the American side of the boundary-line in the
neighbourhood of Lake Champlain.They were shown much sympathy and
encouragement by the Americans, and seem to have laboured under the
delusion that the American government would come to their assistance.A proclamation signed by Robert Nelson, a brother of Wolfred Nelson,
declared the independence of Canada under a {118} 'provisional
government' of which Robert Nelson was president and Dr Cote a member.The identity of the other members is a mystery.Papineau seems to have
had some dealings with Nelson and Cote, and to have dallied with the
idea of throwing in his lot with them; but he soon broke off
negotiations.'Papineau,' wrote Robert Nelson, 'has abandoned us, and
this through selfish and family motives regarding the seigniories, and
inveterate love of the old French bad laws.'There is reason to
believe, however, that Papineau had been in communication with the
authorities at Washington, and that his desertion of Robert Nelson and
Cote was in reality due to his discovery that President Van Buren was
not ready to depart from his attitude of neutrality.On February 28, 1838, Robert Nelson and Cote had crossed the border
with an armed force of French-Canadian refugees and three small
field-pieces.Their plan had contemplated the capture of Montreal and
a junction with another invading force at Three Rivers.But on finding
their way barred by the Missisquoi militia, they had beat a hasty
retreat to the border, without fighting; and had there been disarmed by
the American {119} troops under General Wool, a brave and able officer
who had fought with conspicuous gallantry at the battle of Queenston
Heights in 1812.During the summer months, however, the refugees had continued to lay
plans for an insurrection in Lower Canada.Emissaries had been
constantly moving among the parishes north of the New York and Vermont
frontiers, promising the _Patriotes_ arms and supplies and men from the
United States.And when November
came large bodies of disaffected habitants gathered at St Ours, St
Charles, St Michel, L'Acadie, Chateauguay, and Beauharnois.They had
apparently been led to expect that they would be met at some of these
places by American sympathizers with arms and supplies.No such aid
being found at the rendezvous, many returned to their homes.But some
persevered in the movement, and made their way with packs on their
backs to Napierville, a town fifteen miles north of the boundary-line,
which had been designated as the rebel headquarters.Meanwhile, Robert Nelson had moved northward to Napierville from the
American side of the border with a small band of refugees.{120} Among
these were two French officers, named Hindenlang and Touvrey, who had
been inveigled into joining the expedition.Hindenlang, who afterwards
paid for his folly with his life, has left an interesting account of
what happened.He and Touvrey joined Nelson at St Albans, on the west
side of Lake Champlain.With two hundred and fifty muskets, which had
been placed in a boat by an American sympathizer, they dropped down the
river to the Canadian border.There were five in the party--Nelson and
the two French officers, the guide, and the boatman.Nelson had given
Hindenlang to understand that the habitants had risen and that he would
be greeted at the Canadian border by a large force of enthusiastic
recruits.'There was not a
single man to receive the famous President of the _Provisional
Government_; and it was only after a full hour's search, and much
trouble, [that] the guide returned with five or six men to land the
arms.'On the morning of November 4 the party arrived at Napierville.Here Hindenlang found Dr Cote already at the head of two or three
hundred men.A crowd speedily gathered, and Robert Nelson was
proclaimed 'President of the Republic of {121} Lower Canada.'Hindenlang and Touvrey were presented to the crowd; and to his great
astonishment Hindenlang was informed that his rank in the rebel force
was that of brigadier-general.The first two or three days were spent in hastening the arrival of
reinforcements and in gathering arms.By the 7th Nelson had collected
a force of about twenty-five hundred men, whom Hindenlang told off in
companies and divisions.Most of the rebels were armed with pitchforks
and pikes.An attempt had been made two days earlier, on a Sunday, to
obtain arms, ammunition, and stores from the houses of the Indians of
Caughnawaga while they were at church; but a squaw in search of her cow
had discovered the raiders and had given the alarm, with the result
that the Indians, seizing muskets and tomahawks, had repelled the
attack and taken seventy prisoners.On November 5 Nelson sent Cote with a force of four or five hundred men
south to Rouse's Point, on the boundary-line, to secure more arms and
ammunition from the American sympathizers.On his way south Cote
encountered a picket of a company of loyalist volunteers stationed at
Lacolle, and drove it {122} in.On his return journey, however, he met
with greater opposition.The company at Lacolle had been reinforced in
the meantime by several companies of loyalist militia from Hemmingford.As the rebels appeared the loyalist militia attacked them; and after a
brisk skirmish, which lasted from twenty to twenty-five minutes, drove
them from the field.Without further ado the rebels fled across the
border, leaving behind them eleven dead and a number of prisoners, as
well as a six-pounder gun, a large number of muskets of the type used
in the United States army, a keg of powder, a quantity of
ball-cartridge, and a great many pikes.Of the provincial troops two
were killed and one was severely wounded.The defeat of Cote and his men at Lacolle meant that Nelson's line of
communications with his base on the American frontier was cut.At the
same time he received word that Sir John Colborne was advancing on
Napierville from Laprairie with a strong force of regulars and
volunteers.Under these circumstances he determined to fall back on
Odelltown, just north of the border.He had with him about a thousand
men, eight hundred of whom were armed with muskets.{123} He arrived
at Odelltown on the morning of November 9, to find it occupied by about
two hundred loyal militia, under the command of the inspecting
field-officer of the district, Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor.He had no
difficulty in driving in the loyalist outposts; but the village itself
proved a harder nut to crack.Taylor had concentrated his little force
at the Methodist church, and he controlled the road leading to it by
means of the six-pounder which had been taken from the rebels three
days before at Lacolle.The insurgents extended through the fields to
the right and left, and opened a vigorous fire on the church from
behind some barns; but many of the men seem to have kept out of range.'The greater part of the Canadians kept out of shot,' wrote Hindenlang;
'threw themselves on their knees, with their faces buried in the snow,
praying to God, and remaining as motionless as if they were so many
saints, hewn in stone.Many remained in that posture as long as the
fighting lasted.'The truth appears to be that many of Nelson's men
had been intimidated into joining the rebel force.The engagement
lasted in all about two hours and a half.The defenders of the church
made several successful sallies; and just when the {124} rebels were
beginning to lose heart, a company of loyalists from across the
Richelieu fell on their flank and completed their discomfiture.The
rebels then retreated to Napierville, under the command of Hindenlang.Robert Nelson, seeing that the day was lost, left his men in the lurch
and rode for the American border.The losses of the rebels were
serious; they left fifty dead on the field and carried off as many
wounded.Of the loyalists, one officer and five men were killed and
one officer and eight men wounded.Later in the same day Sir John Colborne, at the head of a formidable
force, entered Napierville.On his approach those rebels who were
still in the village dispersed and fled to their homes.Detachments of
troops were immediately sent out to disperse bands of rebels reported
to be still under arms.The only encounter took place at Beauharnois,
where a large body of insurgents had assembled.After a slight
resistance they were driven out by two battalions of Glengarry
volunteers, supported by two companies of the 71st and a detachment of
Royal Engineers.In these expeditions the British soldiers, especially the volunteers,
did a good deal of burning and harrying.After the victory at {125}
Beauharnois they gave to the flames a large part of the village,
including the houses of some loyal citizens.In view of the
intimidation and depredations to which the loyalists had been subjected
by the rebels in the disaffected districts, the conduct of the men, in
these regrettable acts, may be understood and partially excused.But
no excuse can be offered for the attitude of the British authorities.There are well-authenticated cases of houses of 'notorious rebels'
burned down by the orders of Sir James Macdonell, Colborne's
second-in-command.Colborne himself acquired the nickname of 'the old
Firebrand'; and, while he cannot be charged with such a mania for
incendiarism as some writers have imputed to him, it does not appear
that he took any effective measures to stop the arson or to punish the
offenders.The rebellion of 1838 lasted scarcely a week.Failing important aid from the United States, the
rebels had an even slighter chance of success than they had had a year
before, for since that time the British regular troops in Canada had
been considerably increased in number.The chief responsibility for
the rebellion must be placed at the door of Robert Nelson, who at {126}
the critical moment fled over the border, leaving his dupes to
extricate themselves as best they could from the situation into which
he had led them.As was the case in 1837, most of the leaders of the
rebellion escaped from justice, leaving only the smaller fry in the
hands of the authorities.Of the lesser ringleaders nearly one hundred
were brought to trial.Two of the French-Canadian judges, one of them
being Elzear Bedard, attempted to force the government to try the
prisoners in the civil courts, where they would have the benefit of
trial by jury; but Sir John Colborne suspended these judges from their
functions, and brought the prisoners before a court-martial, specially
convened for the purpose.Twelve of them, including the French officer
Hindenlang, were condemned to death and duly executed.Most of the
others were transported to the convict settlements of Australia.It is
worthy of remark that none of those executed or deported had been
persons of note in the political arena before 1837.On the whole, it
must be confessed that these sentences showed a commendable moderation.It was thought necessary that a few examples should be made, as Lord
Durham's amnesty of the previous year had evidently encouraged some
{127} habitants to believe that rebellion was a venial offence.And
the execution of twelve men, out of the thousands who had taken part in
the revolt, cannot be said to have shown a bloodthirsty disposition on
the part of the government.{128}

CHAPTER XII

A POSTSCRIPT

The rebellion of 1837 now belongs to the dead past.The _Patriotes_
and the 'Bureaucrats' of those days have passed away; and the present
generation has forgotten, or should have forgotten, the passions which
inspired them.The time has come when Canadians should take an
impartial view of the events of that time, and should be willing to
recognize the good and the bad on either side.It is absurd to pretend
that many of the English in Lower Canada were not arrogant and brutal
in their attitude toward the French Canadians, and lawless in their
methods of crushing the rebellion; or that many of the _Patriote_
leaders were not hopelessly irreconcilable before the rebellion, and
during it criminally careless of the interests of the poor habitants
they had misled.On the other hand, no true Canadian can fail to be
proud of the spirit of loyalty which in 1837 {129} actuated not only
persons of British birth, but many faithful sons and daughters of the
French-Canadian Church.Nor can one fail to admire the devotion to
liberty, to 'the rights of the people,' which characterized rebels like
Robert Bouchette.'When I speak of the rights of the people,' wrote
Bouchette, 'I do not mean those abstract or extravagant rights for
which some contend, but which are not generally compatible with an
organized state of society, but I mean those cardinal rights which are
inherent to British subjects, and which, as such, ought not to be
denied to the inhabitants of any section of the empire, however
remote.'The people of Canada to-day are able to combine loyalty and
liberty as the men of that day were not; and they should never forget
that in some measure they owe to the one party the continuance of
Canada in the Empire, and to the other party the freedom wherewith they
have been made free.From a print in M'Gill University
Library.]The later history of the _Patriotes_ falls outside the scope of this
little book, but a few lines may be added to trace their varying
fortunes.Robert Nelson took
up his abode in New York, and there practised surgery until {130} his
death in 1873.E. B. O'Callaghan went to Albany, and was there
employed by the legislature of New York in preparing two series of
volumes entitled _A Documentary History of New York_ and _Documents
relating to the Colonial History of the State of New York_, volumes
which are edited in so scholarly a manner, and throw such light on
Canadian history, that the Canadian historian would fain forgive him
for his part in the unhappy rebellion of '37.Most of the _Patriote_ leaders took advantage, however, of the virtual
amnesty offered them in 1842 by the first LaFontaine-Baldwin
administration, and returned to Canada.Many of these, as well as many
of the _Patriote_ leaders who had not been implicated in the rebellion
and who had not fled the country, rose to positions of trust and
prominence in the public service of Canada.Louis Hippolyte
LaFontaine, after having gone abroad during the winter of 1837-38, and
after having been arrested on suspicion in November 1838, entered the
parliament of Canada, formed, with Robert Baldwin as his colleague, the
administration which ushered in full responsible government, and was
knighted by Queen Victoria.Augustin Morin, the reputed author {131}
of the Ninety-Two Resolutions, who had spent the winter of 1837-38 in
hiding, became the colleague of Francis Hincks in the Hincks-Morin
administration.George Etienne Cartier, who had shouldered a musket at
St Denis, became the lifelong colleague of Sir John Macdonald and was
made a baronet by his sovereign.Dr Wolfred Nelson returned to his
practice in Montreal in 1842.In 1844 he was elected member of
parliament for the county of Richelieu.In 1851 he was appointed an
inspector of prisons.Thomas Storrow Brown, on his return to Montreal,
took up again his business in hardware, and is remembered to-day by
Canadian numismatists as having been one of the first to issue a
halfpenny token, which bore his name and is still sought by collectors.Robert Bouchette recovered from the serious wound he had sustained at
Moore's Corners, and later became Her Majesty's commissioner of customs
at Ottawa.Papineau returned to Canada in 1845.The greater part of his period of
exile he spent in Paris, where he came in touch with the'red
republicans' who later supported the revolution of 1848.He entered
the Canadian parliament in 1847 and sat in it until 1854.{132} But he
proved to be completely out of harmony with the new order of things
under responsible government.Even with his old lieutenant LaFontaine,
who had made possible his return to Canada, he had an open breach.The
truth is that Papineau was born to live in opposition.That he himself
realized this is clear from a laughing remark which he made when
explaining his late arrival at a meeting: 'I waited to take an
opposition boat.'His real importance after his return to Canada lay
not in the parliamentary sphere, but in the encouragement which he gave
to those radical and anti-clerical ideas that found expression in the
foundation of the _Institut Canadien_ and the formation of the _Parti
Rouge_.In many respects the _Parti Rouge_ was the continuation of the
_Patriote_ party of 1837.Papineau's later days were quiet and
dignified.He retired to his seigneury of La Petite Nation at
Montebello and devoted himself to his books.With many of his old
antagonists he effected a pleasant reconciliation.Only on rare
occasions did he break his silence; but on one of these, when he came
to Montreal, an old silver-haired man of eighty-one years, to deliver
an address before the _Institut Canadien_, he uttered a sentence which
may be taken as {133} the _apologia pro vita sua_: 'You will believe
me, I trust, when I say to you, I love my country....  Opinions outside
may differ; but looking into my heart and my mind in all sincerity, I
feel I can say that I have loved her as she should be loved.'And
charity covereth a multitude of sins.{134}

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

The story of the Lower Canada rebellion is told in detail in some of
the general histories of Canada.William Kingsford, _History of
Canada_ (1887-94), is somewhat inaccurate and shows a strong bias
against the _Patriotes_, but his narrative of the rebellion is full and
interesting.F. X. Garneau, _Histoire du Canada_ (1845-52), presents
the history of the period, from the French-Canadian point of view, with
sympathy and power.A work which holds the scales very evenly is
Robert Christie, _A History of the Late Province of Lower Canada_
(1848-55).Christie played a not inconspicuous part in the
pre-rebellion politics, and his volumes contain a great deal of
original material of first-rate importance.Of special studies of the rebellion there are a number worthy of
mention.L. O. David, _Les Patriotes de 1837-38_, is valuable for its
complete biographies of the leaders in the movement.L. N. Carrier,
_Les Evenements de 1837-38_ (1877), is a sketch of the rebellion
written by the son of one of the _Patriotes_.Globensky, _La Rebellion
de 1837 a Saint-Eustache_ (1883), written by the son of an officer in
the loyalist militia, contains some original materials of value.Lord
Charles Beauclerk, _Lithographic Views of Military Operations in Canada
under Sir John Colborne, O.C.B., {135} etc._ (1840), apart from the
value of the illustrations, is interesting on account of the
introduction, in which the author, a British army officer who served in
Canada throughout the rebellion, describes the course of the military
operations.The political aspect of the rebellion, from the Tory point
of view, is dealt with in T. C. Haliburton, _The Bubbles of Canada_
(1839).For a penetrating analysis of the situation which led to the
rebellion see Lord Durham's _Report on the Affairs of British North
America_.A few biographies may be consulted with advantage.N. E. Dionne,
_Pierre Bedard et ses fils_ (1909), throws light on the earlier period;
as does also Ernest Cruikshank, _The Administration of Sir James Craig_
(_Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada_, 3rd series, vol.See also A. D. DeCelles, _Papineau_ (1904), in the 'Makers of Canada'
series; and Stuart J. Reid, _Life and Letters of the First Earl of
Durham_ (1906).The parish histories, in which the province of Quebec abounds, will be
found to yield much information of a local nature with regard to the
rebellion; and the same may be said of the publications of local
historical societies, such as that of Missisquoi county.An original document of primary importance is the _Report of the state
trials before a general court-martial held at Montreal in 1838-39;
exhibiting a complete history of the late rebellion in Lower Canada_
(1839).{136}

     By William Wood.THE RAILWAY BUILDERS
     By Oscar D. Skelton.The rule of a female
monastery especially would be very light.And from the earliest times
we find both the men of Uri in general and the men of particular parts
of the district (_Gemeinden_, _Communes_, or parishes) spoken of as
communities capable of acting together, and even of treating with those
who claimed to be their masters.(“Nos inhabitantes Uroniam” appear in
a deed of 955 as capable of making an agreement with the officer of the
Abbey at Zürich.)All this is in no way peculiar to the Forest Cantons;
it is no more than what we find everywhere; what is peculiar is that,
whereas elsewhere the old local communities gradually died out, in the
Forest Cantons they lived and flourished, and gained new rights and
powers till they grew into absolutely independent commonwealths.I
think therefore that I have a right to speak of the democracy of Uri as
immemorial.It is not immemorial in its fully developed shape, but that
fully developed shape grew step by step out of earlier forms which are
strictly immemorial and common to the whole Teutonic race.On the early history of the democratic Cantons, a subject than which
none has been more thoroughly misunderstood, I am not able to point
to any one trustworthy work in English.Among the writings of Swiss
scholars—shut up for the most part from readers of other nations in the
inaccessible Transactions of local Societies—there is a vast literature
on the subject, of the whole of which I am far from pretending to be
master.But I may refer to the _Essai sur l’Etat des Personnes et la
Condition des Terres dans le Pays d’Ury au XIIIe Siècle_, by the Baron
Frederick de Gingins-la-Sarraz, in the _Archiv für schweizerische
Geschichte_, i.J. R. Burckhardt’s _Untersuchungen über
die erste Bevölkerung des Alpengebirgs_ in the same collection, iv.3; to the early chapters of the great work of Bluntschli, _Geschichte
des schweizerischen Bundesrechtes_ (Zürich, 1849), and of Blumer’s
_Staats-und Rechtsgeschichte der schweizerischen Demokratien_ (St.Alfons Huber, _Die Waldstaette_ (Innsbruck,
1861), and Dr.Wilhelm Vischer, _Die Sage von der Befreiung der
Waldstädte_ (Leipzig, 1867).H. von Liebenau, in _Die Tell-Sage
zu dem Jahre_ 1230, takes a line of his own.The results of the
whole inquiry will be found in the most accessible form in M. Albert
Rilliet’s _Les Origines de la Confédération Suisse_ (Genève et Bâle,
1868).(2) Individual Swiss mercenaries may doubtless still be found in
foreign armies, as Italy some years back knew to her cost.But the
Federal Constitution of 1848 altogether swept away the system of
military capitulations which used to be publicly entered into by the
Cantons.(3) See Johannes von Müller, _Geschichte der schweizerische
Eidgenossenschaft_, Book v., c.25, of his _sämmtliche
Werke_, Stuttgart und Tübingen, 1832, and the note in vol.14;
or the French translation, vol.The description in Peterman Etterlin’s Chronicle, p.204 (Basel, 1752),
is worth quoting in the original.“Dann do der Hertzog von Burgunn
gesach den züg den berg ab züchen, schein die sunn gerad in sy, und
glitzet als wie ein spiegel, des gelichen lüyet das horn von Ury,
auch die harschorne von Lutzern, und was ein sölich toffen, das des
Hertzogen von Burgunn lüt ein grusen darab entpfiengent, und trattent
hinder sich.”

(4) The magistrates rode when I was present at the Landesgemeinden of
1863 and 1864.I trust that so good a custom has not passed away.(5) On the character and position of Phôkiôn, see Grote, xi.481; and on the general question of the alleged fickleness of the
Athenian people, see iv.(6) Some years ago I went through all the elections to the _Bundesrath_
or Executive Council in Switzerland, and found that in eighteen years
it had only twice happened that a member of the Council seeking
reelection had failed to obtain it.I therefore think that I was
right in congratulating a member of the Federal Council, whom I had the
pleasure of meeting last year, on being a member of the most permanent
government in Europe.(7) Under the so-called Helvetic Republic of 1798, the Cantons ceased
to be sovereign States, and became mere divisions, like counties or
departments.One of the earliest provisions of this constitution
abolishes the ancient democracies of the Forest Cantons.“Die
Regierungsform, wenn sie auch sollte verändert werden, soll allezeit
eine repräsentative Demokratie sein.” (See the text in Bluntschli, ii.The “repräsentative Demokratie” thus forced on these ancient
commonwealths by the sham democrats of Paris was meant to exclude the
pure democracy of Athens and Uri.The Federal system was in some sort restored by the Act of Mediation
(_Vermittlungsakte_) of Napoleon Buonaparte, when First Consul in 1803.See the text in Bluntschli, ii.(8) Appenzell, though its history had long been connected with that
of the Confederates, was not actually admitted as a Canton till
December 1513, being the youngest of the thirteen Cantons which
formed the Confederation down to 1798.See Zellweger, _Geschichte des
Appenzellischen Volkes_, ii.366, and the text in his _Urkunden_,
ii.481, or in the older _Appenzeller Chronick_ of
Walser (Saint Gallen, 1740), 410, and the Act in his _Anhang_, p.The frontispiece of this volume contains a lively picture of
a _Landesgemeinde_.In 1597 the Canton was divided into the two
Half-cantons of _Ausser-Rhoden_, Protestant, and _Inner-Rhoden_,
Catholic.(9) On armed assemblies see Norman Conquest, ii.(10) I perhaps need hardly insist on this point after the references
given in my first note; but I find it constantly needful to explain
that there is no such thing as a Swiss _nation_ in any but a political
sense.The Cantons were simply members of the Empire which gradually
won a greater independence than their fellows.And the Forest Cantons,
and the German-speaking Swiss generally, do not even form a distinct
part of the German nation; they are simply three settlements of the
Alemanni, just as the three divisions of Lincolnshire are three
settlements of the Angles.(11) The earliest instance that I know of the use of the word
_Englaland_ is in the Treaty with Olaf and Justin in 991.Its earliest
use in the English Chronicles is in 1014.78, 276, 605, 629.The oldest use that I know of the name Yorkshire
(_Eoforwicscír_) is in the Chronicles under 1065.Deira is, of course, as old as Gregory the Great’s pun.(12) The real history of English parishes has yet to be worked out.I
feel sure that they will be found to have much more in common with the
continental _Gemeinden_ than would seem at first sight.Some hints may
be found in a little pamphlet which I lately came across, called “The
Parish in History.”

(13) The nature of democracy is set forth by Periklês in the Funeral
Oration, Thucydides, ii.37: ὄνομα μὲν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἐς ὀλίγους ἀλλ' ἐς
πλείονας οἰκεῖν δημοκρατία κέκληται· μέτεστι δὲ κατὰ μὲν τοὺς νόμους
πρὸς τὰ ἴδια διάφορα πᾶσι τὸ ἴσον, κατὰ δὲ τὴν ἀξίωσιν ὡς ἕκαστος
ἐν τῷ εὐδοκιμεῖ.It is set forth still more clearly by Athênagoras
of Syracuse, vi.39, where the functions of different classes in a
democracy are clearly distinguished: ἐγὼ δέ φημι πρῶτα μὲν δῆμον
ξύμπαν ὠνομάσθαι, ὀλιγαρχίαν δὲ μέρος, ἔπειτα φύλακας μὲν ἀρίστους
εἶναι χρημάτων τοὺς πλουσίους, βουλεῦσαι δ' ἂν βέλτιστα τοὺς ξυνετοὺς,
κρῖναι δ' ἂν ἀκούσαντας ἄριστα τοὺς πολλοὺς, καὶ ταῦτα ὁμοίως καὶ κατὰ
μέρη καὶ ξύμπαντα ἐν δημοκρατίᾳ ἰσομοιρεῖν.Here a distinct sphere
is assigned both to wealth and to special intelligence.Nearly the
same division is drawn by a writer who might by comparison be called
aristocratic.29) holds that the management of public
affairs should be immediately in the hands of the men of wealth and
leisure, who should act as servants of the People, the People itself
being their master—or, as he does not scruple to say, _Tyrant_—with
full power of reward and punishment: ἐκεῖνοι διεγνωκότες ἦσαν ὅτι δεῖ
τὸν μὲν δῆμον ὥσπερ τύραννον καθιστάναι τὰς ἀρχὰς καὶ κολάζειν τοὺς
ἐξαμαρτάνοντας καὶ κρίνειν περὶ τῶν ἀμφισβητουμένων, τοὺς δὲ σχολὴν
ἄγειν δυναμένους καὶ βίον ἱκανὸν κεκτημένους ἐπιμελεῖσθαι τῶν κοινῶν
ὥσπερ οἰκέτας, καὶ δικαίους μὲν γενομένους ἐπαινεῖσθαι καὶ στέργειν
ταύτῃ τῇ τιμῇ, κακῶς δὲ διοικήσαντας μηδεμιᾶς συγγνώμης τυγχάνειν,
ἀλλὰ ταῖς μεγίσταις ζημίαις περιπίπτειν.This he elsewhere (Panath
166) calls democracy with a mixture of aristocracy—not oligarchy.(τὴν
δημοκρατίαν τὴν ἀριστοκρατίᾳ μεμιγμένην).The unfavourable meaning which is often attached to the word democracy,
when it does not arise from simple ignorance, probably arises from
the use of the word by Aristotle.7) three
lawful forms of government, _kingship_ (βασιλεία), _aristocracy_
(ἀριστοκρατία), and what he calls specially πολιτεία or _commonwealth_.Of these he makes three corruptions, _tyranny_, _oligarchy_, and
_democracy_ (τυραννίς, ὀλιγαρχία, δημοκρατία), defining _democracy_ to
be a government carried on for the special benefit of the poor (πρὸς τὸ
συμφέρον τὸ τῶν ἀπόρων).In this there is something of a philosopher’s
contempt for all popular government, and it is certain that Aristotle’s
way of speaking is not that which is usual in the Greek historians.Polybios, like Herodotus and Thucydides, uses the word democracy in
the old honourable sense, and he takes (ii.38) as his special type of
democracy the constitution of the Achaian League, which certainly had
in it a strong element of practical aristocracy (see History of Federal
Government, cap.): ἰσηγορίας καὶ παρρησίας καὶ καθόλου δημοκρατίας
ἀληθινῆς σύστημα καὶ προαίρεσιν εἰλικρινεστέραν οὐκ ἂν εὕροι τις τῆς
παρὰ τοῖς Ἀχαιοῖς ὑπαρχούσης.In short, what Aristotle calls πολιτεία
Polybios calls δημοκρατία; what Aristotle calls δημοκρατία Polybios
calls ὀχλοκρατία.(14) It follows that, when the commonwealth of Florence disfranchised
the whole of the noble families, it lost its right to be called a
democracy.See the passing of the Ordinance of Justice in Sismondi,
Républiques Italiennes, iv.65; Chroniche di Giovanni Villani, viii.(15) On Slavery in England, see Norman Conquest, i.81, 333, 368,
432, iv.For fuller accounts, see Kemble’s Saxons in England,
i.185; Zöpfl, _Geschichte der deutschen Rechtsinstitute_, 62.The
three classes of nobles, common freemen, and slaves cannot be better
set forth than in the Life of Saint Lebuin (Pertz, ii.361): “Sunt
denique ibi, qui illorum lingua edlingi, sunt qui frilingi, sunt qui
lassi dicuntur, quod in Latina sonat lingua, nobiles, ingenuiles, atque
serviles.”

(16) On the _Wite-þeow_, the slave reduced to slavery for his crimes,
see Kemble, Saxons in England, i.He is mentioned several times in
the laws of Ine, 24, 48, 54, where, as usual in the West-Saxon laws, a
distinction is drawn between the English and the Welsh _wite-þeow_.The
second reference contains a provision for the case of a newly enslaved
_þeow_ who should be charged with a crime committed before he was
condemned to slavery.(17) I wish to leave the details of Eastern matters to Eastern
scholars.But there are several places in the Old Testament where
we see something very much like a general assembly, combined with
distinctions of rank among its members, and with the supremacy of a
single chief over all.Ζεὺς δὲ Θέμιστα κέλευσε θεοὺς ἀγορήνδε καλέσσαι
          Κρατὸς ἄπ' Οὐλύμποιο πολυπτύχου· ἡ δ’ ἄρα πάντη
          Φοιτήσασα κέλευσε Διὸς πρὸς δῶμα νέεσθαι.Οὔτε τις οὖν Ποταμῶν ἀπέην, νόσφ' Ὠκεανοῖο,
          Οὔτ' ἄρα Νυμφάων ταί τ' ἄλσεα καλὰ νέμονται,
          Καὶ πηγὰς ποταμῶν, καὶ πίσεα ποιήεντα.Besides the presence of the Nymphs in the divine _Mycel Gemót_,
something might also be said about the important position of Hêrê,
Athênê, and other female members of the inner council.We find the mortal Assembly described at length in the second book of
the Iliad, and indeed by implication at the very beginning of the first
book.(19) We hear the applause of the assembly in i.333, and in
the Trojan Assembly, xviii.(20) On the whole nature of the Homeric ἀγορή see Gladstone’s Homer and
the Homeric Age, iii.Gladstone has to my thinking understood
the spirit of the old Greek polity much better than Mr.(21) There is no need to go into any speculations as to the early
Roman Constitution, as to the origin of the distinction of _patres_
and _plebs_, or any of the other points about which controversies
have raged among scholars.The three elements stand out in every
version, legendary and historical.8, Romulus first holds
his general Assembly and then chooses his Senate.26 we get
the distinct appeal from the King, or rather from the magistrates
acting by his authority, to an Assembly which, whatever might be its
constitution, is more popular than the Senate.(22) It is hardly needful to show how the Roman Consuls simply stepped
into the place of the Kings.It is possible, as some have thought, that
the revolution threw more power into patrician hands than before, but
at all events the Senate and the Assembly go on just as before.(23) Tacitus, de Moribus Germaniæ, c.7-13:

“Reges ex nobilitate; Duces ex virtute sumunt.Nec Regibus infinita aut
libera potestas; et Duces exemplo potius quam imperio: si prompti, si
conspicui, si ante aciem agant, admiratione præsunt.... De minoribus
rebus Principes consultant; de majoribus omnes; ita tamen ut ea quoque
quorum penes plebem arbitrium est apud Principes pertractentur....
Ut turbæ placuit, considunt armati.Silentium per Sacerdotes, quibus
tum et coercendi jus est, imperatur.Mox Rex, vel Princeps, prout
ætas cuique, prout nobilitas, prout decus bellorum, prout facundia
est audiuntur, auctoritate suadendi magis quam jubendi potestate.Si displicuit sententia, fremitu adspernantur; sin placuit, frameas
concutiunt.Honoratissimum adsensûs genus est, armis laudare.Licet
apud concilium adcusare quoque et discrimen capitis intendere....
Eliguntur in iisdem conciliis et Principes, qui jura per pagos vicosque
reddant.Centeni singulis ex plebe comites, consilium simul et
auctoritas, adsunt.Nihil autem neque publicæ neque privatæ rei nisi
armati agunt.”

For a commentary, see Zöpfl, _Geschichte der deutschen
Rechtsinstitute_, p.See also Allen, Royal Prerogative, 12, 162.The primitive Constitution lasted
longest at the other end of the Empire, in Friesland.See Eichhorn,
_Deutsche Staats-und Rechtsgeschichte_, ii.Zöpfl,
_Geschichte der deutschen Rechtsquellen_, p.(25) Τὰ ἀρχαῖα ἤθη κρατείτω is an ecclesiastical maxim; rightly
understood, it is just as true in politics.(26) See my papers on “the Origin of the English Nation” and “the
Alleged Permanence of Roman Civilization in England” in Macmillan’s
Magazine, 1870.(27) See Schmid, _Gesetze der Angel-Sachsen_, on the words “_wealh_”
and “_wylne_.” Earle, Philology of the English Tongue, 318.On the fact
that the English settlers brought their women with them, see Historical
Essays, p.(28) On _Eorlas_ and _Ceorlas_ I have said something in the History
of the Norman Conquest, i.See the two words in Schmid, and the
references there given.(29) On the Barons of Attinghausen, see Blumer, _Staats- und
Rechtsgeschichte der schweizerischen Demokratien_, i.(30) I cannot at this moment lay my hand on my authority for this
curious, and probably mythical, custom, but it is equally good as an
illustration any way.(31) This custom is described by Diodôros, i.The priest first
recounted the good deeds of the King and attributed to him all possible
virtues; then he invoked a curse for whatever has been done wrongfully,
absolving the King from all blame and praying that the vengeance might
fall on his ministers who had suggested evil things (τὸ τελευταῖον
ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀγνοουμένων ἀρὰν ἐποιεῖτο, τὸν μὲν βασιλέα τῶν ἐγκλημάτων
ἐξαιρούμενος, εἰς δὲ τοὺς ὑπηρετοῦντας καὶ διδάξαντας τὰ φαῦλα καὶ τὴν
βλαβὴν καὶ τὴν τιμωρίαν ἀξιῶν ἀποσκῆψαι).He wound up with some moral
and religious advice.25) distinguishes “eæ gentes quæ regnantur” from
others.And in 43 he speaks of “erga Reges obsequium” as characteristic
of some particular tribes: see Norman Conquest, i.(33) On the use of the words _Ealdorman_ and _Heretoga_, see Norman
Conquest, i.583, and the passages in Kemble and Allen
there referred to.(35) See Kemble’s Saxons in England, i.152, and Massmann’s Ulfilas,
744.(36) See the words _driht_, _drihten_ in Bosworth’s Anglo-Saxon
Dictionary.(37) To say nothing of other objections to this derivation, its author
must have fancied that _ing_ and not _end_ was the ending of the
Old-English participle.The mistake is as old as Sir Thomas Smith.I am
afraid of meddling with Sanscrit, but it strikes me that the views
of Allen and Kemble are not inconsistent with a connexion with the
Sanscrit _Ganaka_.As one of the curiosities of etymology, it is worth
noticing that Mr.Wedgwood makes the word “probably identical with
Tartar _chan_.”

(39) We read in the Chronicles, 449, how, on the first Jutish landing
in Kent, “heora _heretogan_ wæron twegen gebroðra Hengest and Horsa.”
It is only in 455, on the death of Horsa, that “æfter Þam Hengest feng
to _rice_ and Æsc his sunu”; and in 488, seemingly on the death of
Hengest, “Æsc feng to _rice_ and was xxiiii wintra Cantwara _cyning_.”
So among the West-Saxons, in 495, “coman twegen _ealdormen_ on Brytene,
Cerdic and Cynric his sunu.” It is only in 519 that we read “her Cerdic
and Cynric West-Sexena _rice_ onfengun.”

(40) The distinction between Kings and Jarls comes out very strongly
in the account of the battle of Ashdown (Æscesdune) in the Chronicles
in 871.The Danes “wæron on twam gefylcum, on oþrum wæs Bagsecg and
Healfdene, þa hæðenan _cingas_ and on oðrum wæron þa _eorlas_.” It may
be marked that in the English army King Æthelred is set against the
Danish Kings, and his brother the Ætheling Ælfred against the Jarls.So
in the Song of Brunanburh we read of the five Kings and seven Jarls who
were slain.“Fife lagon          sweordum aswefede,
   on ðæm campstede    swilce seofone eac
   ciningas geonge,    eorlas Anlafes.”

We may mark that the Kings were young, as if they had been chosen
“ex nobilitate;” nothing is said of the age of the Jarls, who were
doubtless chosen “ex virtute.”

(41) I have quoted the passage from Bæda about the satraps in Norman
Conquest, i.The passage in the Life of Saint Lebuin, quoted in
note 15, also speaks of “principes” as presiding over the several
_pagi_ or _gauen_, but he speaks of no King or other common chief over
the whole country.And this is the more to be marked, as there was a
“generale concilium” of the whole Old-Saxon nation, formed, as we are
told, of twelve chosen men from each _gau_.This looks like an early
instance of representation, but it should be remembered that we are
here dealing with a constitution strictly Federal.In the like sort we find the rulers of the West-Goths at the time of
their crossing the Danube spoken of as _Judices_.See Ammianus, xxvii.5, and the notes of Lindenbrog and Valesius.So also Gibbon, c. xxv.So Jornandes(26) speaks of “primates eorum, et
duces, qui regum vice illis præerant.” Presently he calls Fredigern
“Gothorum regulus,” like the _subreguli_ or _under-cyningas_ of our own
History.28 Athanaric, the successor of Fredigern, is
pointedly called _Rex_.On all this, see Allen, Royal Prerogative, 163.(43) The best instance in English History of the process by which a
kingdom changed into a province, by going through the intermediate
stage of a half-independent Ealdormanship, is to be found in the
history of South-Western Mercia under its Ealdorman Æthelred and the
Lady Æthelflæd, in the reigns of Ælfred and Eadward the Elder.(45) Iliad, ix.160:—

       καὶ μοὶ ὑποστήτω, ὅσσον β α σ ι λ ε ύ τ ε ρ ό ς ἐιμι.(46) The instances in which a great kingdom has been broken up into a
number of small states practically independent, but owning a nominal
superiority in the successor of the original Sovereign, are not few.In the case of the Empire I have found something to say about it in my
Historical Essays, 151, and in the case of the Caliphate in my History
and Conquest of the Saracens, 137.How the same process took place with
the Mogul Empire in India is set forth by Lord Macaulay in his Essays
on Lord Clive and Warren Hastings.But he should not have compared
the great Mogul, with his nominal sovereignty, to “the most helpless
driveller among the later Carlovingians,” a class whom Sir Francis
Palgrave has rescued from undeserved contempt.But the breaking up of
the Western Kingdom is none the less an example of the same law.The
most remarkable thing is the way, or rather the three different ways,
in which the scattered members have been brought together again in
Germany, Italy, and France.This process of dismemberment, where a nominal supremacy is still kept
by the original Sovereign, must be distinguished from that of falling
back upon Dukes or Ealdormen after a period of kingly rule.In this
latter case it would seem that no central sovereignty went on.(47) At this time of day I suppose it is hardly necessary to prove the
elective character of Old-English kingship.I have said what I have
to say about it in Norman Conquest, i.But I may quote one
most remarkable passage from the report made in 787 to Pope Hadrian the
First by George and Theophylact, his Legates in England (Haddan and
Stubbs, Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents, iii.“Sanximus
ut in ordinatione Regum nullus permittat pravorum prævalere assensum:
sed legitime Reges a sacerdotibus et senioribus populi eligantur.”
One would like to know who the “pravi” here denounced were.The
passage sounds very like a narrowing of the franchise or some other
interference with freedom of election, but in any case it bears witness
to the elective character of our ancient kingship, and to the general
popular character of the constitution.(48) I have described the powers of the Witan, as I understand them
and as they were understood by Mr.108 of the
History of the Norman Conquest and in some of the Appendices to that
volume.With regard to the powers of the Witan, I find no difference
between my own views and those of Professor Stubbs in the Introductory
Sketch to his Select Charters (p.11), where the relations between
the King and the Witan, and the general character of our ancient
constitution, are set forth with wonderful power and clearness.Stubbs and myself differing altogether as to the constitution
of the Witenagemót.I look upon it as an Assembly of the whole kingdom,
after the type of the smaller assemblies of the shire and other lesser
divisions.Stubbs fully admits the popular character of the smaller
assemblies, but denies any such character to the national gathering.It
is dangerous to set oneself up against the greatest master of English
constitutional history, but I must ask the reader to weigh what I say
in note Q in the Appendix to my first volume.(49) I have collected some of the instances of deposition in
Northumberland in the note following that on the constitution of the
Witenagemót.It is not at all unlikely that
the report of George and Theophylact quoted above may have a special
reference to the frequent changes among the Northumbrian Kings.(50) I have mentioned all the instances at vol.105 of the Norman
Conquest: Sigeberht, Æthelred, Harthacnut, Edward the Second, Richard
the Second, James the Second.It is remarkable that nearly all are
the second of their respective names; for, besides Æthelred, Edward,
Richard, and James, Harthacnut might fairly be called Cnut the Second.(51) Tacitus, De Moribus Germaniæ, 13, 14:—“Nec rubor inter comites
adspici.Gradus quinetiam et ipse comitatus habet, judicio ejus quem
sectantur; magnaque et comitum æmulatio quibus primus apud Principem
suum locus; et Principum cui plurimi et acerrimi comites.... Quum
ventum in aciem, turpe Principi virtute vinci, turpe comitatui virtutem
Principis non adæquare.Jam vero infame in omnem vitam ac probrosum,
superstitem Principi suo ex acie recessisse.Illum defendere, tueri,
sua quoque fortia facta gloriæ ejus adsignare, præcipuum sacramentum
est.Principes pro victoria pugnant; comites pro Principe.” See Allen,
Royal Prerogative, 142.(52) The original text of the Song of Maldon will be found in Thorpe’s
Analecta Anglo-Saxonica.My extracts are made from the modern English
version which I attempted in my Old-English History, p.I went
on the principle of altering the Old-English text no more than was
actually necessary to make it intelligible.When a word has altogether
dropped out of our modern language, I have of course changed it; when
a word is still in use, in however different a sense, I have kept it.Many words which were anciently used in a physical sense are now used
only metaphorically; thus “cringe” is used in one of the extracts in
its primary meaning of bowing or falling down, and therefore of dying.(53) The history of the Roman clientship is another of those points on
which legend and history and ingenious modern speculation all come to
much the same, as far as our present purpose is concerned.Whether the
clients were the same as the _plebs_ or not, at any rate no patricians
entered into the client relation, and this at once supplies the
contrast with Teutonic institutions.(54) The title of _dominus_, implying a master of slaves, was always
refused by the early Emperors.This is recorded of Augustus by
Suetonius (Aug.12), and still more distinctly of
Tiberius (Suetonius, Tib.Tiberius also refused
the title of _Imperator_, except in its strictly military sense:
οὔτε γὰρ δεσπότην ἑαυτὸν τοῖς ἐλευθέροις οὔτε αὐτοκράτορα πλὴν τοῖς
στρατιώταις καλεῖν ἐφίει.Caius is said (Aurelius Victor, Cæs.4) to have been called _dominus_, and there is no doubt about Domitian
(Suetonius, Dom.13, where see Reimar’s Note).Pliny
in his letters constantly addresses Trajan as _dominus_; yet in his
Panegyric(45) he draws the marked distinction: “Scis, ut sunt diversa
natura dominatio et principatus, ita non aliis esse principem gratiorem
quam qui maxime dominum graventur.” This marks the return to older
feelings and customs under Trajan.The final and formal establishment
of the title seems to have come in with the introduction of Eastern
ceremonies under Diocletian (see the passage already referred to in
Aurelius Victor).It is freely used by the later Panegyrists, as
for instance Eumenius, iv.13: “Domine Constanti,” “Domine
Maximiane, Imperator æterne,” and so forth.(55) Vitellius (Tac.58) was the first to employ Roman knights
in offices hitherto always filled by freedmen; but the system was not
fully established till the time of Hadrian (Spartianus, Hadrian, 22).89, 587, and the passages here quoted.(57) Both _hlàford_ and _hlæfdige_ (_Lord_ and _Lady_) are very
puzzling words as to the origin of their later syllables.It is enough
for my purpose if the connexion of the first syllable with _hlàf_ be
allowed.Different as is the origin of the two words, _hlàford_ always
translates _dominus_.The French _seigneur_, and the corresponding
forms in Italian and Spanish, come from the Latin _senior_, used as
equivalent to _dominus_.This is one of the large class of words which
are analogous to our _Ealdorman_.(58) This is fully treated by Palgrave, English Commonwealth, i.(59) On the change from the _alod_, _odal_, or _eðel_, a man’s very own
property, to the land held of a lord, see Hallam, Middle Ages, i.Kemble in his chapter on the Noble by Service, Saxons in England, i.(61) See the whole history and meaning of the word in the article
_þegen_ in Schmid’s Glossary.(63) Barbour, Bruce, i.fredome is A noble thing.”

So said Herodotus (v.78) long before:

   ἡ ἰσηγορίη ὡς ἔστι χρῆμα σπουδαῖον.(1) In the great poetical manifesto of the patriotic party in Henry the
Third’s reign, printed in Wright’s Political Songs of England (Camden
Society, 1839), there seems to be no demand whatever for new laws, but
only for the declaration and observance of the old.Thus, the passage
which I have chosen for one of my mottoes runs on thus:—

  “Igitur communitas regni consulatur;
   Et quid universitas sentiat sciatur,
   Cui leges propriæ maxime sunt notæ.Nec cuncti provinciæ sic sunt idiotæ,
   Quin sciant plus cæteris regni sui mores,
   Quos relinquant posteris hii qui sunt priores.Qui reguntur legibus magis ipsas sciunt;
   Quorum sunt in usibus plus periti fiunt;
   Et quia res agitur sua, plus curabunt,
   Et quo pax adquiritur sibi procurabunt.”

(2) On the renewal of the Laws of Eadward by William, see Norman
Conquest, iv.It should be marked that the
Laws of Eadward were again confirmed by Henry the First (see Stubbs,
90-99), and, as the Great Charter grew out of the Charter of Henry
the First produced by Archbishop Stephen Langton in 1213, the descent
of the Charter from the Laws of Eadward is very simple.See Roger of
Wendover, iii.The Primate there distinctly says that
he had made John swear to renew the Laws of Eadward.“Audistis quomodo,
tempore quo apud Wintoniam Regem absolvi, ipsum jurare compulerim, quod
leges iniquas destrueret et leges bonas, videlicet leges Eadwardi,
revocaret et in regno faceret ab omnibus observari.” It must be
remembered that the phrase of the Laws of Eadward or of any other King
does not really mean a code of laws of that King’s drawing up, but
simply the way of administering the Law, and the general political
condition, which existed in that King’s reign.This is all that would
be meant by the renewal of the Laws of Eadward in William’s time.It
simply meant that William was to rule as his English predecessors had
ruled before him.But, by the time of John, men had no doubt begun to
look on the now canonized Eadward as a lawgiver, and to fancy that
there was an actual code of laws of his to be put in force.On the various confirmations of the Great Charter, see Hallam, Middle
Ages, ii.“When they were told that there was no precedent
for declaring the throne vacant, they produced from among the records
of the Tower a roll of parchment, near three hundred years old, on
which, in quaint characters and barbarous Latin, it was recorded that
the Estates of the Realm had declared vacant the throne of a perfidious
and tyrannical Plantagenet.” See more at large in the debate of the
Conference between the Houses, ii.(4) See Kemble, Saxons in England, ii.This, it will be
remembered, is admitted by Professor Stubbs.See above, note 48 to
Chapter I.(6) I have collected these passages in my History of the Norman
Conquest, i.(7) On the acclamations of the Assembly, see note 19 to Chapter I. I
suspect that in all early assemblies, and not in that of Sparta only,
κρίνουσι βοῇ καὶ οὐ ψήφῳ (Thuc.We still retain the custom in
the cry of “Aye” and “No,” from which the actual vote is a mere appeal,
just like the division ordered by Sthenelaïdas when he professed not to
know on which side the shout was.100, and History of Federal Government, i.In this case the Chronicler, under
the year 1086, distinguishes two classes in the Assembly, “his witan
and ealle Þa landsittende men Þe ahtes wæron ofer eall Engleland.”
These “landsittende men” were evidently the forerunners of the “libere
tenentes,” who, whether their holdings were great or small, kept their
place in the early Parliaments.140-146, where will be
found many passages showing the still abiding traces of the popular
constitution of the Assembly.(10) The practice of summoning particular persons can be traced up to
very early times.202, for instances in the reign of
Æthelstan.On its use in later times, see Hallam, ii.254-260; and on
the irregularity in the way of summoning the spiritual peers, ii.The bearing of these precedents on the question of life peerages
will be seen by any one who goes through Sir T. E. May’s summary,
Constitutional History, i.(11) Sismondi, Histoire des Français, v.289: “Ce roi, le plus absolu
entre ceux qui ont porté la couronne de France, le moins occupé du
bien de ses peuples, le moins consciencieux dans son observation des
droits établis avant lui, est cependant le restaurateur des assemblées
populaires de la France, et l’auteur de la représentation des communes
dans les états généraux.” See Historical Essays, 45.(12) See the history of Stephen Martel in Sismondi, Histoire des
Français, vol.ix., and the account of the dominion of
the Butchers, vii.259, and more at large in Thierry’s History of the
Tiers-État, capp.(13) The Parliament of Paris, though it had its use as some small check
on the mere despotism of the Crown, can hardly come under the head of
free institutions.France, as France, under the old state of things,
cannot be said to have kept any free institutions at all; the only
traces of freedom were to be found in the local Estates which still met
in several of the provinces.See De Tocqueville, Ancien Régime, 347.(14) The thirteenth century was the time when most of the existing
states and nations of Europe took something like their present form and
constitution.The great powers which had hitherto, in name at least,
divided the Christian and Mahometan world, the Eastern and Western
Empires and the Eastern and Western Caliphates, may now be looked on
as practically coming to an end.England, France, and Spain began to
take something like their present shape, and to show the beginnings of
the characteristic position and policy of each.The chief languages of
Western Europe grew into something like their modern form.In short,
the character of this age as a time of beginnings and endings might be
traced out in detail through the most part of Europe and Asia.Pauli does not scruple to give him this title in his admirable
monograph, “_Simon von Montfort Graf von Leicester, der Schöpfer des
Hauses der Gemeinen_.” The career of the Earl should be studied in this
work, and in Mr.Blaauw’s “Barons’ War.”

(16)                “Numquam libertas gratior exstat
      Quam sub rege pio.”—Claudian, ii.“England owes her escape from such calamities
to an event which her historians have generally represented as
disastrous.Her interest was so directly opposed to the interest of her
rulers that she had no hope but in their errors and misfortunes.The
talents and even the virtues of her six first French Kings were a curse
to her.The follies and vices of the seventh were her salvation....
England, which, since the battle of Hastings, had been ruled generally
by wise statesmen, always by brave soldiers, fell under the dominion
of a trifler and a coward.The Norman nobles were compelled to make
their election between the island and the continent.Shut up by the sea
with the people whom they had hitherto oppressed and despised, they
gradually came to regard England as their country, and the English as
their countrymen.The two races so long hostile, soon found that they
had common interests and common enemies.Both were alike aggrieved by
the tyranny of a bad King.Both were alike indignant at the favour
shown by the court to the natives of Poitou and Aquitaine.The great
grandsons of those who had fought under William and the great grandsons
of those who had fought under Harold began to draw near to each other
in friendship; and the first pledge of their reconciliation was the
Great Charter, won by their united exertions, and framed for their
common benefit.”

(18) I have tried to work out the gradual character of the transfer of
lands and offices under William in various parts of the fourth volume
of my History of the Norman Conquest; see especially p.The popular notion of a general scramble for everything gives a most
false view of William’s whole character and position.(20) This is distinctly asserted in the Dialogus de Scaccario (i.10),
under Henry the Second: “Jam cohabitantibus Anglicis et Normannis,
et alterutrum uxores ducentibus vel nubentibus, sic permixtæ sunt
nationes, ut vix discerni possit hodie, de liberis loquor, quis
Anglicus quis Normannus sit genere; exceptis duntaxat ascriptitiis qui
villani dicuntur, quibus non est liberum obstantibus dominis suis a sui
statûs conditione discedere.”

(21) The Angevin family are commonly known as the Plantagenets; but
that name was never used as a surname till the fifteenth century.The name is sometimes convenient, but it is not a really correct
description, like Tudor and Stewart, both of which were real surnames,
borne by the two families before they came to the Crown.In the
almanacks the Angevins are called “The Saxon line restored,” a name
which gives a false idea, though there can be no doubt that Henry the
Second was fully aware of the advantages to be drawn from his remote
female descent from the Old-English Kings.The point to be borne in
mind is that the accession of Henry is the beginning of a distinct
dynasty which could not be called either Norman or English in any but
the most indirect way.(22) I do not remember anything in any of the writers of Henry the
Second’s time to justify the popular notions about “Normans and
Saxons” as two distinct and hostile bodies.Nor do we as yet hear many
complaints of favour being shown to absolute foreigners in preference
to either, though it is certain that many high preferments, especially
in the Church, were held by men who were not English in either sense.The peculiar position of Henry the Second was something like that of
the Emperor Charles the Fifth, that of a prince ruling over a great
number of distinct states without being nationally identified with any
of them.Henry ruled over England, Normandy, and Aquitaine, but he was
neither English, Norman, nor Gascon.(23) That is the greater, the continental, part of the Duchy.The
insular part of Normandy, the Channel Islands, was not lost, and it
still remains attached to the English Crown, not as part of the United
Kingdom, but as a separate dependency.310, 367; and on the appointment of
Bishops and Abbots, i.(25) See the Ordinance in Norman Conquest, iv.Stubbs, Select
Charters, 81.(27) It should be remembered that the clerical immunities which were
claimed in this age were by no means confined to those whom we should
now call clergymen, but that they also took in that large class of
persons who held smaller ecclesiastical offices without being what we
should call in holy orders.The Church also claimed jurisdiction in
the causes of widows and orphans, and in various cases where questions
of perjury, breach of faith, and the like were concerned.Thus John
Bishop of Poitiers writes to Archbishop Thomas (Giles, Sanctus Thomas,
vi.238) complaining that the King’s officers had forbidden him to hear
the causes of widows and orphans, and also to hear causes in matters
of usury: “prohibentes ne ad querelas viduarum vel orphanorum vel
clericorum aliquem parochianorum meorum in causam trahere præsumerem
super quacumque possessione immobili, donec ministeriales regis, vel
dominorum ad quorum feudum res controversiæ pertineret, in facienda
justitia eis defecissent.Deinde ne super accusatione fœnoris
quemquam audirem.” This gives a special force to the acclamations
with which Thomas was greeted on his return as “the father of the
orphans and the judge of the widows:” “Videres mox pauperum turbam
quæ convenerat in occursum, hos succinctos ut prævenirent et patrem
suum applicantem exciperent, et benedictionem præriperent, alios vero
humi se humiliter prosternentes, ejulantes hos, plorantes illos præ
gaudio, et omnes conclamantes, Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini,
pater orphanorum et judex viduarum!et pauperes quidem sic.” Herbert
of Bosham, Giles, Sanctus Thomas, vii.See more in
Historical Essays, 99.(28) On the cruel punishments inflicted in the King’s courts Herbert
of Bosham is very emphatic in more than one passage.101) as a merit of the Bishops’ courts that in them no mutilations
were inflicted.Men were punished there “absque omni mutilatione
vel deformatione membrorum.” But he by no means claims freedom from
mutilation as a mere clerical privilege; he distinctly condemns it in
any case.“Adeo etiam quod ordinis privilegium excludat cauterium: quam
tamen pœnam communiter inter homines etiam jus forense damnat: ne
videlicet in homine Dei imago deformetur.” (vii.A most curious
story illustrative of the barbarous jurisprudence of the time will be
found in Benedict’s Miracula Sancti Thomæ, 184.(29) One of the Constitutions of Clarendon forbade villains to be
ordained without the consent of their lords.“Filii rusticorum non
debent ordinari absque assensu domini de cujus terra nati dignoscuntur”
(Stubbs, Select Charters, 134).On the principles of feudal law nothing
can be said against this, as the lord had a property in his villain
which he would lose by the villain’s ordination.The prohibition
is noticed in some remarkable lines of the earliest biographer of
Thomas, Garnier of Pont-Sainte-Maxence (La Vie de Saint Thomas le
Martyr, Paris, 1859, p.89), where he strongly asserts the equality of
gentleman and villain before God:—

  “Fils à vilains ne fust en nul liu ordenez
   Sanz l’otrei sun seigneur de cui terre il fu nez.Et deus à sun servise nus a tuz apelez!Mielz valt filz à vilain qui est preux e senez,
   Que ne feit gentilz hum failliz et debutez.”

Thomas himself was not the son of a villain, but his birth was such
that the King could sneer at him as “plebeius quidam clericus.”

(30) We are not inclined to find fault with such an appointment as
that of Stephen Langton; still his forced election at the bidding
of Innocent was a distinct breach of the rights of the King, of the
Convent of Christ Church, and of the English nation generally.See the
account of his election in Roger of Wendover, iii.314; Hook’s Archbishops, ii.(31) See the Bulls and Letters by which Innocent professed to annul the
Great Charter in Roger of Wendover, iii.323, 327; the excommunication
of the Barons in iii.336; and the suspension of the Archbishop in iii.(32) There is a separate treatise on the Miracles of Simon of Montfort,
printed along with Rishanger’s Chronicle by the Camden Society, 1840.(33) I think I may safely say that the only royalist chronicler of the
reign of Henry the Third is Thomas Wykes, the Austin Canon of Osney.There is also one poem on the royalist side, to balance many on the
side of the Barons, among the Political Songs published by the Camden
Society, 1839, page 128.Letters to Earl Simon and his Countess Eleanor form a considerable part
of the letters of Robert Grosseteste, published by Mr.Luard for the
Master of the Rolls.Matthew Paris also (879, Wats) speaks of him as
“episcopus Lincolniensis Robertus, cui comes tamquam patri confessori
exstitit familiarissimus.” This however was in the earlier part of
Simon’s career, before the war had broken out.The share of Bishop
Walter of Cantilupe, who was present at Evesham and absolved the Earl
and his followers, will be found in most of the Chronicles of the time.It comes out well in the riming Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester (ii.558):—

  “Þe bissop Water of Wurcetre asoiled hom alle pere
   And prechede hom, þat hii adde of deþ þe lasse fere.”

This writer says of the battle of Evesham:—

  “Suich was þe morþre of Eivesham (vor bataile non it was).”

(34) This letter, addressed in 1247 to Pope Innocent the Fourth, will
be found in Matthew Paris (721, Wats).It is written in the name of
“universitas cleri et populi per provinciam Cantuariensem constituti,”
and it ends, “quia communitas nostra sigillum non habet, præsentes
literas signo communitatis civitatis Londinensis vestræ sanctitati
mittimus consignatas.” Another letter in the same form follows to the
Cardinals.There are two earlier letters in 1245 and 1246 (Matthew
Paris, 666, 700), the former from the “magnates et universitas regni
Angliæ,” the other in the name of Richard Earl of Cornwall (afterwards
King of the Romans), Simon Earl of Leicester, and other Earls, “et alii
totius regni Angliæ Barones, proceres, et magnates, et nobiles portuum
maris habitatores, necnon et clerus et populus universus.” The distinct
mention of the Cinque Ports, whose representatives in Parliament are
still called Barons—the “nobiles” of the letter—should be noticed.(35) The writer of the Gesta Stephani(3) distinctly attributes the
election of Stephen to the citizens of London: “Majores igitur natu,
consultuque quique provectiores, concilium coegere, deque regni
statu, pro arbitrio suo, utilia in commune providentes, ad regem
eligendum unanimiter conspiravere.” He then goes on with the details
of the election.He is borne out by the Chronicle 1135: “Stephne de
Blais com to Lundene and te Lundenisce folc him underfeng;” and by
William of Malmesbury, Historia Novella, i.11: “A Londoniensibus et
Wintoniensibus in Regem exceptus est.” So again when the Legate, Henry
Bishop of Winchester, holds a council for the election of the Empress
Matilda, the citizens of London were summoned, and it is distinctly
said that they held the rank of nobles or barons: “Londonienses
(qui sunt quasi optimates, pro magnitudine civitatis, in Anglia).”
“Londonienses, qui præcipui habebantur in Anglia, sicut proceres”
(Historia Novella, iii.All this is exactly like the earlier
elections of Kings before the Conquest.(36) The words of the Charter 12-14 (Stubbs, 290) are: “Nullum
scutagium vel auxilium ponatur in regno nostro, nisi per commune
consilium regni nostri, nisi ad corpus nostrum redimendum, etc.....
Et ad habendum commune consilium regni, de auxilio assidendo aliter
quam in tribus casibus prædictis, vel de scutagio assidendo, summoneri
faciemus archiepiscopos, episcopos, abbates, comites, et majores
barones, sigillatim per litteras nostras; et præterea faciemus
summoneri in generali, per vicecomites et ballivos nostros, omnes
illos qui de nobis tenent in capite.” This is exactly like the entry
in the Chronicle (1123), describing the summoning of a Witenagemót by
Henry the First: “Da sone Þæræfter sende se kyng hise write ofer eal
Englalande, and bed hise biscopes and hise abbates and hise Þeignes
ealle Þet hi scolden cumen to his gewitenemot on Candelmesse deig to
Gleawceastre him togeanes; and hi swa diden.”

(37) These first glimmerings of parliamentary representation were
carefully traced out by Hallam (Middle Ages, ii.They can
now be more fully studied in the work of Professor Stubbs.On the
summons in 1213 of four men for each shire besides “milites et barones”
(“quatuor discretos homines de comitatu tuo illuc venire facias”),
the Professor remarks (278): “It is the first writ in which the ‘four
discreet men’ of the county appear as representatives; the first
instance of the summoning of the folkmoot to a general assembly by the
machinery already used for judicial purposes.”

(38) On this subject the eighth chapter of Sir Francis Palgrave’s
English Commonwealth should be studied.(39) For the whole career of Simon I must again refer generally to
Pauli and Blaauw.The great writ itself, dated at Worcester, December
14th, 1264, will be found in Rymer’s Fœdera, i.It has often
been noticed how small is the number of Earls and other lay Barons, and
how unusually large the number of churchmen, who are summoned to this
Parliament.The whole list will be found in Rymer.The parts of the
writ which concern us stand thus:

“Item mandatum est singulis vicecomitibus per Angliam; quod venire
faciant duos milites de legalioribus, probioribus et discretioribus
militibus singulorum comitatuum, ad Regem London’ in octab’ prædictis,
in formâ supradictâ.“Item in formâ prædictâ scribitur civibus Ebor’, civibus Lincoln’,
et cæteris burgis Angliæ; quod mittant in formâ prædictâ duos de
discretioribus, legalioribus, et probioribus, tam civibus, quam
burgensibus suis.“Item in formâ prædictâ mandatum est baronibus, et probis hominibus
Quinque Portuum.”

“This is often regarded as the origin of popular representation; but it
is not in any sense entitled to that praise.The novelty was simply the
assembling the representatives of the towns in conjunction with those
of the counties; this was now done for the first time for the purpose
of the national council.” Stubbs, 401.(40) The account of this most remarkable trial, held on June 11th,
1252, is given in a letter from Simon’s intimate friend the famous
Franciscan Adam Marsh (de Marisco) to Bishop Robert Grosseteste.Brewer’s Monumenta Franciscana, p.122,
and there is an English translation in the Appendix to Mrs.Green’s
Life of Countess Eleanor, English Princesses, ii.Simon’s
witnesses, knights and citizens, come “muniti litteris patentibus
communitatis Burdegalensis, in quâ quasi totum robur Vasconiæ ad
distringendum hostiles et fideles protegendum consistere dignoscitur,”
setting forth how good Simon’s government was in every way, and how
those who brought charges against him did it only because his strict
justice had put a check on their misdoings.We may compare the words of
the great poetical manifesto (Political Songs, 76).“Seductorem nominant S. atque fallacem,
   Facta sed examinant probantque veracem.”

(41) For the Londoners at Lewes let us take the account of an enemy.Thomas Wykes (148) tells us how the Earl set out, “glorians in virtute
sua congregata baronum multitudine copiosa, Londoniensium innumerabili
agmine circumcinctus, quia legitur stultorum infinitus est numerus.”
Presently we read how the “Londoniensium innumera multitudo, bellorum
ignara,” were put to flight by the Lord Edward very much after the
manner of Prince Rupert.(42) On the religious reverence paid to Earl Waltheof, see Norman
Conquest, ii.I have there referred to the office of Thomas of
Lancaster, which will be found in Political Songs, 268.Some of the
pieces are what we should think most daring parodies of parts of the
Church Service, but we may be sure that what was intended was reverence
and not irreverence.There is another parody of the same kind in honour
of Earl Thomas, a little earlier back in the volume, p.It was a
matter of course that Thomas of Lancaster should be likened to Thomas
of Canterbury.“Gaude, Thoma, ducum decus, lucerna Lancastriæ,
   Qui per necem imitaris Thomam Cantuariæ;
   Cujus caput conculcatur pacem ob ecclesiæ,
   Atque tuum detruncatur causa pacis Angliæ.(43) Let us take a Latin, a French, and an English specimen of the
poems in which Simon’s death was lamented and his intercession implored.“Salve, Symon Montis Fortis,
     Totius flos militiæ,
   Durus pœnas passus mortis,
     Protector gentis Angliæ.Sunt de sanctis inaudita
   Cunctis passis in hac vita,
     Quemquam passum talia;
   Manus, pedes, amputari,
   Caput, corpus, vulnerari,
     Abscidi virilia.Sis pro nobis intercessor
   Apud Deum, qui defensor
     In terris exstiteras.”—(Political Songs, 124.)The French poem which follows directly in the collection is too long to
copy in full.This is perhaps the most remarkable stanza, in which we
again find the comparison with Thomas of Canterbury:—

  “Mès par sa mort, le cuens Mountfort conquist la victorie,
   Come ly martyr de Caunterbyr, finist sa vie;
   Ne voleit pas li bon Thomas qe perist seinte Eglise,
   Le cuens auxi se combati, e morust sauntz feyntise.Ore est ocys la flur de pris, qe taunt savoit de guerre,
   Ly quens Montfort, sa dure mort molt emplorra la terre.”

In this poem there is not, as in the Latin one, any direct prayer to
the martyred Earl, but in the last stanza we read:—

  “Sire Simoun ly prodhom, e sa compagnie,
   En joie vont en ciel amount, en pardurable vie.”

The only English piece on these wars belongs to an earlier date,
namely, the satirical poem against King Richard, how the one English
Augustus

  “Makede him a castel of a mulne post;”

but we get verses on Simon’s death in the Chronicle of Robert of
Gloucester (ii.559):—

  “& sir Simond was aslawe, & is folk al to grounde,
   More murÞre are nas in so lute stounde.Vor Þere was werst Simond de Mountfort aslawe, alas!& sir Henri is sone, Þat so gentil knizt was.*       *       *       *       *

   & among alle oÞere mest reuÞe it was ido,
   Þat sir Simon Þe olde man demembred was so.”

He then goes on with the details of the dismemberment, of which a
picture may be seen opposite p.Blaauw’s book, and then goes
on with the lines which I have before quoted:—

  “Suich was Þe morÞre of Eivesham (vor bataile non it was),
   And Þer wiÞ Jesu Crist wel vuele ipaied was,
   As he ssewede bitokninge grisliche and gode,
   As it vel of him sulue, Þo he deide on Þe rode,
   Þat Þoru al Þe middelerd derk hede Þer was inou.”

(44) On the occasional and irregular summoning of the borough members
between 1265 and 1295 see Hallam, Middle Ages, ii.160, 165, and
more fully in Stubbs, Select Charters, 420, 427, where the gradual
developement of parliamentary representation is treated as it has
never been treated before, with a full citation of the authorities.The language in which the chroniclers speak of the constitution of the
early Parliaments of Edward is as vague as that in which our ancient
Gemóts are described.Sometimes they speak only of “proceres” and the
like; sometimes they distinctly mention the popular element.Curiously
enough, the official language is sometimes more popular than that of
the annalists.Thus the Winchester Annals, recording the Statute of
Westminster in 1273, call the Assembly which passed it a “communis
convocatio omnium magnatum regni,” though it incidentally implies the
presence of other persons, “quamplures de regno qui aliqua feoda de
corona regia tenuerunt.” But the preamble of the Statute itself records
the “assentement des erceveskes, eveskes, abbes, priurs, contes,
barons, et _la communaute de la tere_ ileokes somons.” So in the later
Parliament of the same year the Annals speak only of the “communis
consensus archiepiscoporum, comitum, et baronum,” while the official
description is “prælati, comites, barones, et alii de regno nostro.”
But in an earlier Assembly, that held in 1273, before Edward had come
back to England, the same Winchester Annals tell us how “convenerunt
archiepiscopi et episcopi, comites et barones, et _de quolibet comitatu
quatuor milites et de qualibet civitate quatuor_.” This and the
summons to the Parliament of 1285, which sat in judgement on David
of Wales (Stubbs, 453, 457), seem the most distinct cases of borough
representation earlier than 1295, since which time the summoning of the
borough members has gone on regularly.Stubbs’
remarks on the Assemblies of “the transitionary period” in pp.465, 469
should be specially studied.(45) The history of the resistance of these two Earls to King Edward,
which led to the great Confirmation of the Charters in 1297, will be
found in all the histories of the time, old and new.See also Stubbs,
431, 479.I feel no difficulty in reconciling respect for Edward with
respect for the men who withstood him.The case is well put by Stubbs,
34, 35.(46) The exact value of the document commonly known as the statute “De
Tallagio non concedendo” is discussed by Professor Stubbs, p.It
is perhaps safest to look on it, like many of the earlier collections
of laws, not indeed as an actual statute, but as good evidence of a
principle which, from the time of the Confirmation of the Charters, has
been universally received.The words are—

“Nullum tallagium vel auxilium per nos vel hæredes nostros de cetero in
regno nostro imponatur seu levetur, sine voluntate et assensu communi
archiepiscoporum, episcoporum et aliorum prælatorum, comitum, baronum,
militum, burgensium, et aliorum liberorum hominum in regno nostro.”
This, it will be seen, is the same provision which I have already
quoted (see above, Note 36) from the Great Charter of John, but which
was left out in the Charter in the form in which it was confirmed by
Henry the Third.See Stubbs, 330, 332, 336.(47) I have said this before in Historical Essays, p.On the
strongly marked legal character of Edward’s age, and especially of
Edward’s own mind, see Stubbs, 417.(48) The great statute of treason of 25 Edward the Third (see the
Revised Edition of the Statutes, i.185) secures the life of the King,
his wife, and his eldest son, and the chastity of his wife, his eldest
daughter, and his eldest son’s wife.But the personal privilege goes no
further.As the Law of England knows no classes of men except peers and
commoners, it follows that the younger children of the King—the eldest
is born Duke of Cornwall—are, in strictness of speech, commoners,
unless they are personally raised to the peerage.I am not aware that
either case has ever arisen, but I conceive that there is nothing to
hinder a King’s son, not being a peer, from voting at an election, or
from being chosen to the House of Commons, and I conceive that, if
he committed a crime, he would be tried by a jury.Mere precedence
and titles have nothing to do with the matter, though probably a good
deal of confusion arises from the very modern fashion—one might almost
say the modern vulgarism—of calling all the children of the King or
Queen “Princes” and “Princesses.” As late as the time of George the
Second uncourtly Englishmen were still found who eschewed the foreign
innovation, and who spoke of the Lady Caroline and the Lady Emily, as
their fathers had done before them.Another modern vulgarism is that of using the word “royal”—“royal
visit,” “royal marriage,” and so forth—when there is no royalty in the
case, the person spoken of being a subject, perhaps a commoner.(49) On the parliamentary position of the clergy see Hallam, Middle
Ages, ii.And as far as the reign of Edward the First is
concerned, see the series of summonses in Stubbs, 442.(50) On this important constitutional change, which was made in
1664, without any Act of Parliament, but by a mere verbal agreement
between Archbishop Sheldon and Lord Chancellor Clarendon, see Hallam,
Constitutional History, ii.(51) This is true on the whole, especially at the beginning of the
institution of the States General, though there were also _roturiers_
who were the immediate burgesses of the King.See Thierry, History
of the Tiers Etat, i.It is in that work that the
history of that branch of the States General should be studied.(52) The question of one or two Chambers in an ordinary monarchy or
commonwealth is altogether different from the same question under a
Federal system.In England or France the question between one or two
Chambers in the Legislature is simply a question in which of the two
ways the Legislature is likely to do its work best.But in a Federal
constitution, like that of Switzerland or the United States, the two
Chambers are absolutely necessary.The double sovereignty, that of
the whole nation and that of the independent and equal States which
have joined together to form it, can be rightly represented only
by having two Chambers, one of them, the _Nationalrath_ or House
of Representatives, directly representing the nation as such, and
the other, the _Ständerath_ or Senate, representing the separate
sovereignty of the Cantons.In the debates early in 1872 as to the
revision of the Swiss Federal Constitution, a proposal made in the
_Nationalrath_ for the abolition of the _Ständerath_ was thrown out by
a large majority.(53) On the old Constitution of Sweden, see Laing’s Tour in Sweden.(54) This common mistake and its cause are fully explained by Hallam,
Middle Ages, ii.(55) “The two Houses had contended violently in 1675, concerning the
appellate jurisdiction of the Lords; they had contended, with not less
violence, in 1704, upon the jurisdiction of the Commons in matters of
election; they had quarrelled rudely, in 1770, while insisting upon
the exclusion of strangers.But upon general measures of public policy
their differences had been rare and unimportant.” May’s Constitutional
History, i.The writer goes on to show why differences between the
two Houses on important points have become more common in very recent
times.(56) The share of the Witan in early times in the appointment of
Bishops, Ealdormen, and other great officers, need hardly be dwelled
upon.For a debate in a Witenagemót of Eadward the Confessor on a
question of peace or war, see Norman Conquest, ii.For the like
under Henry the Third, see the account in Matthew Paris, in the year
1242 which will be found in Stubbs, 359.The state of the case under
Edward the Third is discussed by Hallam, Middle Ages, ii.But the most remarkable passage of all is one in the
great poetical manifesto which I have several times quoted: it is there
(Political Songs, 96) made one of the charges against Henry the Third
that he wished to keep the appointment of the great officers of state
in his own hands.The passage is long, but it is well worth quoting at
length.“Rex cum suis voluit ita liber esse;
   Et sic esse debuit, fuitque necesse
   Aut esse desineret rex, privatus jure
   Regis, nisi faceret quidquid vellet; curæ
   Non esse magnatibus regni quos præferret
   Suis comitatibus, vel quibus conferret
   Castrorum custodiam, vel quem exhibere
   Populo justitiam vellet, et habere
   Regni cancellarium thesaurariumque.Suum ad arbitrium voluit quemcumque,
   Et consiliarios de quacumque gente,
   Et ministros varios se præcipiente,
   Non intromittentibus se de factis regis
   Angliæ baronibus, vim habente legis
   Principis imperio, et quod imperaret
   Suomet arbitrio singulos ligaret.”

(57) Take for example the Act passed after Edward the Fourth’s success
at Towton.Among other things, poor Henry the Sixth
is not only branded as an usurper, but is charged with personally
stirring up the movement in the North, which led to the battle of
Wakefield and the death of Richard Duke of York.“The seid Henry
Usurpour, late called Kyng Henry the Sixt, contynuyng in his olde
rancour & malice, usyng the fraude & malicious disceit & dissimulacion
ayenst trouth & conscience, that accorde not with the honoure of eny
Cristen Prynce,... with all subtill ymaginacions & disceitfull weyes
& meanes to hym possible, intended & covertely laboured, excited &
procured the fynal destruction, murdre & deth of the seid Richard Duc,
and of his Sonnes, that is to sey, of oure seid nowe Soverayne Lord
Kyng Edward the fourth, then Erle of Marche, & of the noble Lord Edmund
Erle of Ruthlande; & for th’ execution of his dampnable & malicious
purpose, by writing & other messages, mowed, excited, & stured therunto
the Duks of Excestr’ & Somerset, & other lordes beyng then in the North
parties of this Reame.”

(58) This statute was passed in 8 Henry VI.The complaint
which it makes is well worth notice, and shows the reactionary
tendencies of the time.The county elections had been made by “very
great, outrageous, and excessive number of people dwelling within the
same counties, of which most part was people of small substance, and
of no value, whereof every of them pretended a voice equivalent, as to
such elections to be made, with the most worthy knights and esquires
dwelling within the same counties.” To hinder “the manslaughters,
riots, batteries, and divisions,” which were likely to take place—it is
not said that they had taken place—no one is to be allowed to vote who
has not “free land or tenement to the value of forty shillings by the
year at the least above all charges.” It is also provided that both the
electors and the elected are to be actually resident in the county.“Item come lez eleccions dez Chivalers des Countees esluz a venir as
parlements du Roi en plusours Countees Dengleterre, ore tarde ount
este faitz par trop graunde & excessive nombre dez gents demurrantz
deinz mesmes les Countes, dount la greindre partie estoit par gentz

chescun ait frank tenement a le valu de xl s. par an al meins outre les
reprises; & que ceux qui seront ensy esluz soient demurrantz & receantz
deins mesmes les Countes.” Revised Statutes, i.The necessity of residence in the case of either electors or
representatives was repealed by 14 Geo.The statute goes on to give the Sheriff power to examine the electors
on oath as to the amount of their property.It also gives the Judges of
Assize a power foreshadowing that of our present Election Judges, that
of inquiring into false returns made by the Sheriff.Another statute of the same kind was passed later in the same reign,
23 Henry VI.1444-5, from which it appears that the knights of
the shire were ceasing to be in all cases knights in the strict sense,
and that it was beginning to be found needful to fence them about with
oligarchic restrictions.“Issint que lez Chivalers dez Counteez pour le parlement en après a
esliers so ent notablez Chivalers dez mesmez lez Counteez pour lez
queux ils serront issint esluz, ou autrement tielx notablez Esquiers
gentils homez del Nativite dez mesmez lez Counteez comme soient ablez
destre Chivalers; et null home destre tiel Chivaler que estoise en la
degree de vadlet et desouth.” Revised Statutes, i.Every enactment of this kind bears witness to the growth of the power
of the Commons, and to the endeavours of the people to make their
representation really popular.(59) Take for instance the account given by the chronicler Hall (p.253) of the election of Edward the Fourth.“After the lordes had considered and weyghed his title and declaracion,
they determined by authoritie of the sayd counsaill, for as much as
kyng Henry, contrary to his othe, honor and agreement, had violated
and infringed, the order taken and enacted in the last Parliament,
and also, because he was insufficient to rule the Realme, & inutile
to the common wealth, & publique profite of the pore people, he was
therefore by the aforesayed authoritie, depriued & deiected of all
kyngly honor, & regall souereigntie.And incontinent, Edward erle of
Marche, sonne and heyre to Richard duke of Yorke, was by the lordes in
the sayd counsaill assembled, named, elected, & admitted, for kyng &
gouernour of the realme; on which day, the people of the erles parte,
beyng in their muster in sainct Ihons felde, & a great number of the
substanciall citezens there assembled, to behold their order: sodaynly
the lord Fawconbridge, which toke the musters, wisely declared to
the multitude, the offences & breaches of the late agremente done &
perpetrated by kyng Henry the vi.& demaunded of the people, whether
they woulde haue the sayd kyng Henry to rule & reigne any lenger ouer
them: To whome they with a whole voyce, aunswered, nay, nay.Then
he asked them, if they would serue, loue, & obey the erle of March
as their earthly prince & souereign lord.To which question they
aunswered, yea, yea, crieng, king Edward, with many great showtes and
clappyng of handes.... The erle,... as kyng, rode to the church of
sainct Paule, and there offered.And after _Te deum_ song, with great
solempnitie, he was conueyed to Westmynster, and there set in the
hawle, with the scepter royall in his hand, where to all the people
which there in a great number were assembled, his title and clayme
to the croune of England, was declared by, ii.maner of ways: the
firste, as sonne and heyre to duke Richard his father, right enheritor
to the same; the second, by aucthoritie of Parliament and forfeiture
committed by, kyng Henry.Wherupon it was agayne demaunded of the
commons, if they would admitte, and take the sayd erle as their prince
and souereigne lord, which al with one voice cried, yea, yea.... On
the morow he was proclaymed kyng by the name of kyng Edward the iiij.throughout the citie.”

This was in Lent 1461, before the battle of Towton.Edward was crowned
June 29th in the same year.The same chronicler describes the election
or acknowledgement of Richard the Third, p.(60) One special sign of the advance of the power of Parliament in the
fifteenth century was the practice of bringing in bills in the form
of Statutes ready made.Hitherto the Acts of the Commons had taken
the form of petitions, and it was sometimes found that, after the
Parliament had broken up, the petitions had been fraudulently modified.They now brought in bills, which the King accepted or rejected as they
stood.“The knight of the shire was the connecting link
between the baron and the shopkeeper.On the same benches on which
sate the goldsmiths, drapers, and grocers who had been returned to
Parliament by the commercial towns, sate also members who, in any other
country, would have been called noblemen, hereditary lords of manors,
entitled to hold courts and to bear coat armour, and able to trace
back an honourable descent through many generations.Some of them were
younger sons and brothers of great lords.Others could boast even of
royal blood.At length the eldest son of an Earl of Bedford, called
in courtesy by the second title of his father, offered himself as a
candidate for a seat in the House of Commons, and his example was
followed by others.Seated in that house, the heirs of the grandees of
the realm naturally became as zealous for its privileges as any of the
humble burgesses with whom they were mingled.”

Hallam remarks (ii.250) that it is in the reign of Edward the Fourth
that we first find borough members bearing the title of Esquire, and
he goes on to refer to the Paston Letters as showing how important
a seat in Parliament was then held, and as showing also the undue
influences which were already brought to bear upon the electors.Since
Hallam’s time, the authenticity of the Paston Letters has been called
in question, but it has, I think, been fully established.Some of the
entries are very curious indeed.96), without any date of
the year, the Duchess of Norfolk writes to John Paston, Esquire, to
use his influence at a county election on behalf of some creatures of
the Duke’s: “It is thought right necessarie for divers causes þͭ my
Lord have at this tyme in the p’lement suche p’sones as longe unto him
and be of his menyall S’vaunts wherin we conceyve yoͬ good will and
diligence shal be right expedient.” The persons to be thus chosen for
the convenience of the Duke are described as “our right wel-belovid
Cossin and S’vaunts John Howard and Syr Roger Chambirlayn.” This is
followed by a letter from the Earl of Oxford in 1455, much to the same
effect.98, we have a letter addressed to the Bailiff of Maldon,
recommending the election of Sir John Paston on behalf of a certain
great lady not named.“Ryght trusty frend I comand me to yow preyĩg yow to call to yoʳ
mynd that lyek as ye and I comonyd of it were necessary for my Lady

(62) On the effects of the reign of Charles the Fifth in Spain and
his overthrow of the liberties of Castile, see the general view in
Robertson, iii.186) he glorifies
the King’s clemency.See also the first chapter of the sixth book
of Prescott’s Philip the Second, and on the suppression of the
constitution of Aragon by Philip, Watson, Philip the Second, iii.The last meeting of the French States-General before the final meeting
in 1789 was that in 1614, during the minority of Lewis the Thirteenth.(63) The legal character of William’s despotism I have tried to set
forth almost throughout the whole of my fourth volume.8, 617; but it is plain to everyone who has the slightest knowledge
of Domesday.Nothing can show more utter ignorance of the real
character of the man and his times than the idea of William being a
mere “rude man of war,” as I have seen him called.(64) On the true aspect of the reign of Henry the Eighth I have said
something in the Fortnightly Review, September 1871.(65) Both these forms of undue influence on the part of the Crown
are set forth by Hallam, Constitutional History, i.“It will not be pretended,” he says, “that the wretched villages,
which corruption and perjury still hardly keep from famine [this was
written before the Reform Bill, in 1827], were seats of commerce and
industry in the sixteenth century.But the county of Cornwall was more
immediately subject to a coercive influence, through the indefinite and
oppressive jurisdiction of the stannary court.Similar motives, if we
could discover the secrets of those governments, doubtless operated in
most other cases.”

In the same page the historian, speaking of the different boroughs and
counties which received the franchise in the sixteenth century, says,
“It might be possible to trace the reason, why the county of Durham was
passed over.” And he suggests, “The attachment of those northern parts
to popery seems as likely as any other.” The reason for the omission
of Durham was doubtless that the Bishoprick had not wholly lost the
character of a separate principality.It was under Charles the Second
that Durham city and county, as well as Newark, first sent members to
Parliament.Durham was enfranchised by Act of Parliament, as Chester
city and county—hitherto kept distinct as being a Palatinate—were by
34 & 35 Hen.Newark was
enfranchised by a Royal Charter, the last case of that kind of exercise
of the prerogative.(66) I do not know what was the exact state of Old Sarum in 1265 or
in 1295, but earlier in the thirteenth century it was still the chief
dwelling-place both of the Earl and of the Bishop.But in the reign
of Edward the Third it had so greatly decayed that the stones of the
Cathedral were used for the completion of the new one which had arisen
in the plain.(67) On the relations between Queen Elizabeth and her Parliaments,
and especially for the bold bearing of the two Wentworths, Peter and
Paul, see the fifth chapter of Hallam’s Constitutional History, largely
grounded on the Journals of Sir Simonds D’Ewes.The frontispiece to
D’Ewes’ book (London, 1682) gives a lively picture of a Parliament of
those days.(68) On the relations between the Crown and the House of Commons under
James the First, see the sixth chapter of Hallam’s Constitutional
History, and the fifth chapter of Gardner’s History of England from
1603 to 1616.(1) This was the famous motion made by Sir Robert Peel against the
Ministry of Lord Melbourne, and carried by a majority of one, June 4,
1841.See May’s Constitutional History, i.Irving’s Annals of our
Times, 86.(2) This of course leaves to the Ministry the power of appealing to the
country by a dissolution of Parliament; but, if the new Parliament also
declares against them, it is plain that they have nothing to do but to
resign office.In the case of 1841 Lord Melbourne dissolved Parliament,
and, on the meeting of the new Parliament, an amendment to the address
was carried by a majority of ninety-one, August 28, 1841.(3) This is well set forth by Sir John Fortescue, De Laudibus Legum
Angliæ, cap.36: “Neque Rex ibidem, per se aut ministros suos,
tallegia, subsidia, aut quævis onera alia, imponit legiis suis, aut
leges eorum mutat, vel novas condit, sine concessione vel assensu
totius regni sui in parliamento suo expresso.”

(4) How very recent the establishment of these principles is will be
seen by anyone who studies the history of the reign of George the Third
in the work of Sir T. E. May.Pitt, as is well known, kept office
in defiance of repeated votes of the House of Commons, and at last, by
a dissolution at a well-chosen moment, showed that the country was on
his side.Such conduct would not be deemed constitutional now, but the
wide difference between the constitution of the House of Commons then
and now should be borne in mind.(5) Though the command of the Sovereign would be no excuse for any
illegal act, and though the advisers of any illegal act are themselves
responsible for it, yet there would seem to be no way provided for
punishing an illegal act done by the Sovereign in his own person.The
Sovereign may therefore be said to be personally irresponsible.(6) See Macaulay, iv.It should not be forgotten that writers like
Blackstone and De Lolme say nothing about the Cabinet.Serjeant Stephen
supplies the omission, ii.(7) The lowly outward position of the really ruling assembly comes out
in some degree at the opening of every session of Parliament.But it is
far more marked in the grotesque, and probably antiquated, ceremonies
of a Conference of the two Houses.This comes out most curiously of all
in the Conference between the two Houses of the Convention in 1688.(8) See Note 56, Chapter ii.(9) See Macaulay, iv.(10) “Ministers” or “Ministry” were the words always used at the
time of the Reform Bill in 1831-1832.It would be curious to trace
at what time the present mode of speech came into vogue, either in
parliamentary debates or in common speech.Another still later change marks a step toward the recognition of the
Cabinet.It has long been held that a Secretary of State must always
accompany the Sovereign everywhere.It is now beginning to be held that
any member of the Cabinet will do as well as a Secretary of State.But
if any member of the Cabinet, why not any Privy Councillor?Cayley moved for a “Select Committee to
consider the duties of the Member leading the Government business in
this House, and the expediency of attaching office and salary thereto.”
The motion was withdrawn, after being opposed by Sir Charles Wood
(now Viscount Halifax), Mr.Walpole, and Lord John Russell (now Earl
Russell).Sir Charles Wood described the post of Leader of the House
as “an office that does not exist, and the duties of which cannot be
defined.” Mr.Walpole spoke of it as a “position totally unknown to the
constitution of the country.” Yet I presume that everybody practically
knew that Lord John Russell was Leader of the House, though nobody
could give a legal definition of his position.Walpole and Lord John Russell on the nature of
ministerial responsibility.Walpole said that “members were apt to
talk gravely of ministerial responsibility; but responsibility there is
none, except by virtue of the office that a Minister holds, or possibly
by the fact of his being a Privy Councillor.A Minister is responsible
for the acts done by him; a Privy Councillor for advice given by him in
that capacity.Until the reign of Charles the Second, Privy Councillors
always signed the advice they gave; and to this day the Cabinet is not
a body recognised by law.As a Privy Councillor, a person is under
little or no responsibility for the acts advised by him, on account of
the difficulty of proof.” Lord John Russell “asked the House to pause
before it gave assent to the constitutional doctrines laid down by Mr.He unduly restricted the responsibility of Ministers.”... “I
hold,” continued Lord John, “that it is not really for the business the
Minister transacts in performing the particular duties of his office,
but it is for any advice which he has given, and which he may be
proved, before a Committee of this House, or at the bar of the House of
Lords, to have given, that he is responsible, and for which he suffers
the penalties that may ensue from impeachment.”

It is plain that both Mr.Walpole and Lord Russell were here speaking
of real legal responsibility, such responsibility as might be enforced
by impeachment or other legal process, not of the vaguer kind of
responsibility which is commonly meant when we speak of Ministers being
“responsible to the House of Commons.” This last is enforced, not by
legal process, but by such motions as that of Sir Robert Peel in 1841,
or that of the Marquess of Hartington in June 1859.I have made my extracts from the Spectator newspaper of February 11,
1854.(12) We read (Anglia Sacra, i.335) of Æthelric, Bishop of the
South-Saxons at the time of the Conquest, as “vir antiquissimus et
legum terræ sapientissimus.” So Adelelm, the first Norman Abbot of
Abingdon, found much benefit from the legal knowledge of certain of his
English monks (Chronicon Monasterii de Abingdon, ii.2), “quibus tanta
secularium facundia et præteritorum memoria eventorum inerat, ut cæteri
circumquaque facile eorum sententiam ratam fuisse, quam edicerent,
approbarent.” The writer adds, “Sed et alii plures de Anglis causidici
per id tempus in abbatia ista habebantur quorum collationi nemo sapiens
refragabatur.” But knowledge of the law was not an exclusively clerical
accomplishment; for among the grounds for the election of King Harold
himself, we find (de Inventione Sanctæ Crucis Walthamensis, p.25,
Stubbs) that one was “quia non erat eo prudentior in terra, armis
strenuus magis, legum terræ sagacior.” See Norman Conquest, ii.(13) On the growth of the lawyers’ theory of the royal prerogative, and
its utter lack of historical standing-ground, I must refer once for all
to Allen’s Inquiry into the Rise and Growth of the Royal Prerogative in
England.(15) The history of this memorable revolution will be found in
Lingard, iii.392-405, and the legal points are brought out by Hallam,
Middle Ages, ii.He remarks that “In this revolution of 1399
there was as remarkable an attention shown to the formalities of the
constitution, allowance made for the men and the times, as in that
of 1688;” and, speaking of the device by which the same Parliament
was brought together again, he adds, “In this contrivance, more than
in all the rest, we may trace the hand of lawyers.” The official
version entered on the rolls of Parliament by command of Henry will
be found in Walsingham, ii.Some care seems to be used to
avoid using the name of Parliament in the account of the actual
proceedings.It is said just before, “Rex perductus est Londonias,
conservandus in Turri usque ad Parliamentum proximo celebrandum.”
And the writs are said to have been sent “ad personas regni qui de
jure debeant interesse Parliamento.” But when they have come together
(“quibus convenientibus”) care seems to be taken to give the Assembly
no particular name, till, in the Act of Richard’s deposition, the
actors are described as “pares et proceres regni Angliæ spirituales
et temporales, et ejus regni communitates, omnes status ejusdem regni
repræsentantes;” and in the Act of Henry’s election they are described
as “domini tam spirituales quam temporales, et omnes regni status.” In
the Act of deposition Richard’s resignation of the Crown is recorded,
as well as his particular crimes and his general unfitness to wear it,
all which are classed together as reasons for his deposition.The
actual formula of deposition runs thus:—“propter præmissa, et eorum
prætextu, ab omni dignitate et honore regiis, _si quid dignitatis et
honoris hujusmodi in eo remanserit_, merito deponendum pronunciamus,
decernimus, et declaramus; et etiam simili cautela deponimus.” They
then declare the throne to be vacant (“ut constabat de præmissis,
et eorum occasione, regnum Angliæ, cum pertinentiis suis, vacare”).Henry then makes his challenge, setting forth that strange mixture of
titles which is commented on in most narratives of the event, and the
Estates, without saying which of Henry’s arguments they accept, grant
the kingdom to him (“concesserunt unanimiter ut Dux præfatus super eos
regnaret”).A more distinct case of deposition and election can hardly
be found; only in the words which I have put in italics there seems a
sort of anxiety to complete, by the act of deposition, any possible
defect in Richard’s doubtless unwilling abdication.The French narrative by a partisan of Richard (Lystoire de la Traison
et Mort du Roy Richart Dengleterre, p.68) gives, in some respects, a
different account.The Assembly is called a Parliament, and the Duke
of Lancaster is made to seat himself on the throne at once.Then Sir
Thomas Percy “cria ‘Veez Henry de Lencastre Roy Dengleterre.’ Adonc
crierent tous les seigneurs prelaz et _le commun de Londres_, Ouy Ouy
nous voulons que Henry duc de Lencastre soit nostre Roy et nul autre.”
For “le commun de Londres” there are other readings, “le commun,” “le
commun Dangleterre et de Londres,” and “tout le commun et conseil de
Londres.”

(16) It should be remembered that Charles the First was not deposed,
but was executed being King.He was called King both in the indictment
at his trial and in the warrant of his beheading.(17) Monk raised this point in 1660.612) remarks that at this particular moment “there
was no court to influence, no interference of the military to control
the elections.” The Convention may therefore be supposed to have been
more freely elected than most Parliaments.(19) The Long Parliament had dissolved itself, and had decreed the
election of its successor.733) the Long Parliament is “declared and adjudged to be fully
dissolved and determined;” but it is not said when it was dissolved and
determined.5; Hallam’s Constitutional History,
ii.21, where the whole matter is discussed, and it is remarked that
“the next Parliament never gave their predecessors any other name in
the Journals than ‘the late assembly.’”

(20) See Norman Conquest, i.(21) See the discussion on the famous vote of the Convention Parliament
in Hallam, Constitutional History, ii.Hallam remarks that “the word ‘forfeiture’ might better have answered
this purpose than ‘abdication’ or ‘desertion,’” and he adds, “they
proceeded not by the stated rules of the English government, but by
the general rights of mankind.They looked not so much to Magna Charta
as the original compact of society, and rejected Coke and Hale for
Hooker and Harrington.” My position is that there is no need to go to
what Hallam calls “higher constitutional laws” for the justification
of the doings of the Convention, but that they were fully justified
by the precedents of English History from the eighth century to the
fourteenth.The Scottish Estates, it should be remembered, did not shrink from
using the word “forfeited.” Macaulay, iii.(22) See the Act 1 William and Mary “for removing and preventing all
Questions and Disputes concerning the Assembling and Sitting of this
Present Parliament” (Revised Statutes, ii.It decrees “That the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons convened at Westminster the
two and twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand
six hundred eighty-eight, and there sitting on the thirteenth day of
February following, are the two Houses of Parliament, and so shall be
and are hereby declared enacted and adjudged to be to all intents,
constructions, and purposes whatsoever, notwithstanding any fault of
writ or writs of summons, or any defect of form or default whatsoever,
as if they had been summoned according to the usual form.” The whole
history of the question is given in Macaulay, iii.The whole
matter is summed up in the words (iii.27), “It was answered that the
royal writ was mere matter of form, and that to expose the substance
of our laws and liberties to serious hazard for the sake of a form
would be the most senseless superstition.Wherever the Sovereign, the
Peers spiritual and temporal, and the Representatives freely chosen by
the constituent bodies of the realm were met together, there was the
essence of a Parliament.” In earlier times it might perhaps have been
held that there might be the essence of a Parliament even without the
Sovereign.“A paper had been circulated, in which the
logic of a small sharp pettifogger was employed to prove that writs,
issued in the joint names of William and Mary, ceased to be of force
as soon as William reigned alone.But this paltry cavil had completely
failed.It had not even been mentioned in the Lower House, and had been
mentioned in the Upper only to be contemptuously overruled.” From my
point of view the cavil is certainly paltry, but it is hard to see that
it is more paltry than the others.(24) This is by the Acts 7 and 8 Will.See Stephen’s Commentaries, ii.Blackstone’s
reasoning runs thus: “This dissolution formerly happened immediately
upon the death of the reigning sovereign; for he being considered in
law as the head of the parliament (caput principium, et finis), that
failing, the whole body was held to be extinct.But the calling a new
parliament immediately on the inauguration of the successor being found
inconvenient, and dangers being apprehended from having no parliament
in being, in case of a disputed succession, it was enacted,” etc.By
the Reform Act of 1867 the whole tradition of the lawyers was swept
away.(25) I have said something on this head in Norman Conquest, i.94,
but the whole thing should be studied in Allen’s great section on the
Tenure of Landed Property; Royal Prerogative, 125-155.It is to Allen
that the honour belongs of showing what _bookland_ and _folkland_
really were.(26) I have given a few examples in Norman Conquest, i.Endless
examples will be found in Kemble’s Codex Diplomaticus.(27) See the complaints on this head as late as the time of William
the Third, in Macaulay, iv.On the Acts by which the power of the
Crown in this matter is restrained, see Stephen’s Commentaries, ii.See also May’s Constitutional History, i.(29) This is discussed in full by Allen, Royal Prerogative, 143-145.The great example is the will of King Ælfred.249; Allen, 154-155, who remarks: “By a singular
revolution of policy there was a recurrence in the late reign to the
ancient policy of the Anglo-Saxons.The crown lands were virtually
restored to the public, while the King obtained the right of acquiring
landed property by purchase, and of bequeathing it by will like a
private person.”

(31) Edward the First was the earliest King whose reign is dated from
a time earlier than his coronation.He was out of the kingdom at his
father’s death, and his right was acknowledged without opposition.But
even in this case there was an interregnum.The regnal years of Edward
the First are not reckoned from the day of his father’s death, but
from the day of his funeral, when Edward was acknowledged King, and
when the prelates and nobles swore allegiance to him.See the account
in the Worcester Annals, Annales Monastici, iv.462, and the documents
in Rymer, i. part ii.See also the remarks of Allen, 46, 47.The
doctrine that there can be no interregnum seems to have been put into
shape to please James the First, and it was of course altogether upset
by the great vote of 1688.Now of course there is no interregnum; not
indeed from any mysterious prerogative of the Crown, but simply because
the Act of Settlement has entailed the Crown in a particular way.(32) On this see Norman Conquest, i.See the same
question discussed in quite another part of the world in Herodotus,
vii.(33) The helpless way in which Blackstone himself wrote was perhaps
pardonable in the dark times in which he lived.But it is really too
bad when lawyer after lawyer, in successive editions, gives again to
the world the astounding rubbish which in Blackstone’s day passed
for early constitutional history.In Kerr’s edition of Blackstone,
published in 1857, vol.180, I find repeated, without alteration
or comment, the monstrous assertion of Blackstone: “I believe there
is no instance wherein the Crown of England has ever been asserted to
be elective, except by the regicides at the infamous and unparalleled
trial of King Charles I.” And in Serjeant Stephen’s Commentaries
(1853), which are not a mere edition of Blackstone, but “New
Commentaries partly founded on Blackstone,” the same words are found
in vol.403, only leaving out the epithet “unparalleled,” which
might with truth have been allowed to stay.481-2) we read how “after the Saxon government was firmly established
in this island” came “the subdivision of the kingdom into a heptarchy,
consisting of seven independent kingdoms, peopled and governed by
different clans and colonies.” It seems then that in 1857 there
were learned gentlemen who believed in a kingdom subdivided into a
heptarchy.But when, in the next page, Blackstone tells us how Ælfred
set about “to new-model the constitution, to rebuild it on a plan that
should endure for ages,” and goes on in the usual style to attribute
everything whatever to Ælfred personally, this seems to have been too
much, and the editor gives an extract from Kemble by way of correction.One wonders that, if he had read Kemble at all, he had not learned a
little more from him.It is amusing again when Blackstone tells us (i.186, Kerr), “From Egbert to the death of Edmund Ironside, a period
of above two hundred years, the Crown descended regularly through a
succession of fifteen princes, without any deviation or interruption:
save only”—all the cases where it did not descend regularly, according
to Blackstone’s notions of regularity: But it is almost more amusing
when Serjeant Stephen (ii.410) throws Blackstone’s exceptions, which
are at least historical facts, into a note, and gives us instead as
his own exceptions, the statement, very doubtful and, if true, utterly
irrelevant, that Æthelstan and Eadmund Ironside were illegitimate (see
Norman Conquest, i.We of course get the usual talk about the
usurpations of Harold, Stephen, John, and Henry the Fourth, and about
the rights of Eadgar and Arthur of Britanny.For the former we get a
quotation from Matthew Paris, to whom it would have been more to the
purpose to go for the great speech of Archbishop Hubert.The comments
on the succession of John (i.189, Kerr) are singularly amusing, but
too long to quote.To prove the strictly hereditary
nature of the succession, Blackstone (i.189, Kerr) quotes the Statute
of 25 Edward III.“that the law of the Crown of England is, and always
hath been, that the children of the King of England, whether born in
England or elsewhere, ought to bear the inheritance after the death of
their ancestors.” We are bound to suppose that these learned lawyers
had read through the statute which they quoted; but it is wonderful
that they did not see that it had nothing whatever to do with fixing
the hereditary succession of the Crown.The original text (Revised
Statutes, i.176) runs thus:—

“La lei de la Corone Dengleterre est, et ad este touz jours tiele,
que les enfantz des Rois Dengleterre, _queu part qils soient neez en
Engleterre ou aillors_, sont ables et deivent porter heritage, apres la
mort lour auncestors.”

The object of the statute is something quite different from what any
one would think from Blackstone’s way of quoting it.The emphatic words
are those which are put in italics.The object of the statute is to
make the King’s children and others born of English parents beyond sea
capable of inheriting in England.As far as the succession to the Crown
is concerned, its effect is simply to put a child of the King born out
of the realm on a level with his brother born in the realm; that is,
in the view of our older Law, to give both alike the preference due to
an Ætheling.(34) It is as well to explain this, because most people seem to think
that a man becomes a Bishop by virtue of receiving a private letter
from the First Lord of the Treasury.We constantly see a man spoken of
as Bishop of such a see, and his works advertised as such, before a
single ecclesiastical or legal step has been taken to make him so.(36) The succession of a grandson, which first took place in England in
the case of Richard the Second, marks a distinct stage in the growth
of the doctrine of hereditary right.It involves the doctrine of
representation, which is a very subtle and technical one, and is not
nearly so obvious or so likely to occur in an early state of society
as the doctrine of nearness of kin.No opposition was made to the
accession of Richard the Second, but there seems to have been a strong
notion in men’s minds that John of Gaunt sought to displace his nephew.In earlier times, as the eldest and most eminent of the surviving sons
of Edward the Third, John would probably have been elected without any
thought of the claims of young Richard.(37) In Yorkist official language the three Lancastrian Kings were
usurpers, and Duke Richard was _de jure_, though not _de facto_, King.Henry the Sixth is, in the Act of 1461, “Henry Usurpour, late called
Kyng Henry the sixt.” The claim of the House of York was through an
intricate female descent from Lionel Duke of Clarence, a son of Edward
the Third older than John of Gaunt.A claim so purely technical had
never been set forth before; but we may be quite sure that it would not
have been thought to have much weight, if Duke Richard had not been, by
another branch, descended from Edward the Third in the male line, and
if he had not moreover been the ablest and most popular nobleman in the
country.(38) A prospective election before the vacancy of course hindered
any interregnum.In this case the formula “Le Roi est mort; vive le
Roi,” was perfectly true.The new King was already chosen and crowned,
and he had nothing to do but to go on reigning singly instead of in
partnership with his father, just as William went on reigning alone
after the death of Mary.In Germany this took place whenever a King
of the Romans was chosen in the lifetime of the reigning Emperor.In
France, under the early Kings of the Parisian dynasty, the practice
was specially common, and the fact that there seldom or never was an
interregnum doubtless helped much to make the French Crown become, as
it did, the most strictly hereditary crown in Christendom.In England,
the only distinct case of a coronation of a son during the lifetime of
his father was that of Henry, the son of Henry the Second, known as the
younger King, and sometimes as Henry the Third.In earlier times we get
something like it in the settlement of the Crown by Æthelwulf, with the
consent of his Witan (see Old-English History, 105, 106), but it does
not seem clear whether there was in this case any actual coronation
during the father’s lifetime.If there was not, this would be the case
most like that of Duke Richard.The compromise placed the Duke in the
same position as if he had been Prince of Wales, or rather in a better
position, for it might be held to shut out the need of even a formal
election on the King’s death.(39) See note 59 on Chapter II.(41) See Hallam’s Constitutional History, i.It is to be noticed
that the settlement enacts that “the inheritance of the Crown, &c.,
should remain in Henry the Seventh and the heirs of his body for ever,
and in none other.” This would seem to bar a great number of contingent
claims in various descendants of earlier Kings.As it happens, this Act
has been literally carried out, for every later Sovereign of England
has been a descendant of the body of Henry the Seventh.(42) The will of Henry the Eighth is fully discussed by Hallam, i.34,
288, 294; Lingard, vi.There are two Acts of Henry’s reign bearing
on the matter.7, the Crown is
entailed on the King’s sons by Jane Seymour or any other wife; then
on the King’s legitimate daughters, no names being mentioned; the Act
then goes on to say, “your Highnes shall have full and plenar power
and auctorite to geve despose appoynte assigne declare and lymytt by
your letters patentes under your great seale or ells by your laste Will
made in wrytynge and signed with your moste gracious hande, at your
onely pleasure from tyme to tyme herafter, the imperiall Crowne of this
Realme and all other the premisses thereunto belongyng, to be remayne
succede and come after your decease and for lack of lawfull heires of
your body to be procreated and begoten as is afore lymytted by this
Acte, to such person or persones in possession and remaynder as shall
please your Highnes and according to such estate and after such maner
forme facion ordre and condicion as shalbe expressed declared named and
lymytted in your said letters patentes or by your said laste will.”
The later Act, 35 Henry VIII.1, puts Henry’s two daughters, Mary
and Elizabeth, into the entail, but in a very remarkable way.The Acts
declaring their illegitimacy are not repealed, nor is the legitimacy of
either of them in any way asserted; in fact it is rather denied when
the preamble rehearses that “The king’s Majesty hath only issue of his
body lawfully begotten betwixt his Highness and his said late wife
Queen Jane the noble and excellent Prince Edward.” The Act then goes
on to enact that, although the King had been enabled to “dispose” the
Crown “to any person or persons of such estate therein as should please
his Highness to limit and appoint,” yet that, in failure of heirs of
the body of either the King or his son, “the said imperial Crown and
all other the premises shall be to the Lady Mary the King’s Highness
daughter, and to the heirs of the body of the same Lady Mary lawfully
begotten, with such conditions as by his Highness shall be limited by
his letters patents under his great seal, or by his Majesty’s last will
in writing signed with his gracious hand.” Failing Mary and her issue,
the same conditional entail is extended to Elizabeth and her issue.The
power of creating a remainder after the issue of Elizabeth of course
remained with Henry, and he exercised it in favour of the issue of his
younger sister Mary.Mary and Elizabeth therefore really reigned, not
by virtue of any royal descent, but by virtue of a particular entail by
which the Crown was settled on the King’s illegitimate daughters, as it
might have been settled on a perfect stranger.It was an attempt on the
part of Edward the Sixth to do without parliamentary authority what his
father had done by parliamentary authority which led to the momentary
occupation of the throne by Lady Jane Grey.Mary, on her accession,
raked up the whole story of her mother’s marriage and divorce, and the
Act of the first year of her reign recognized her as inheriting by
legitimate succession.The Act passed on the accession of Elizabeth,
1 Eliz.It enacts “that your majestie our sayd
Sovereigne Ladye ys and in verye dede and of most meere right ought
to bee by the Lawes of God and the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme
our most rightfull and lawfull Sovereigne liege Ladie and Quene; and
that your Highness ys rightlye lynyallye and lawfully discended and
come of the bloodd royall of this Realme of Englande in and to whose
princely person and theires of your bodye lawfully to bee begotten
after youe without all doubte ambiguitee scruple or question the
imperiall and Royall estate place crowne and dignitie of this Reallme
withe all honnours stiles titles dignities Regalities Jurisdiccons and
preheminences to the same nowe belonging & apperteyning arre & shalbee
most fully rightfully really & entierly invested & incorporated united
& annexed as rightfully & lawfully to all intentes construccons &
purposes as the same were in the said late Henrye theight or in the
late King Edwarde the Syxte your Highnes Brother, or in the late Quen
Marye your Highnes syster at anye tyme since thacte of parliament made
in the xxxvth yere of the reigne of your said most noble father king
Henrye theight.”

It should be remembered that Sir Thomas More, though he refused to
swear to the preamble of the oath prescribed by the Act of Supremacy,
was ready to swear to the order of succession which entailed the Crown
on the issue of Anne Boleyn.On his principles the issue of Anne Boleyn
would be illegitimate; but he also held that Parliament could settle
the Crown upon anybody, on an illegitimate child of the King or on an
utter stranger; to the succession therefore he had no objection to
swear.For a parallel to the extraordinary power thus granted to Henry we have
to go back to the days of Æthelwulf.(43) The position of the daughters of Henry the Eighth was of course
practically affected by the fact that each was the child of a mother
who was acknowledged as a lawful wife at the time of her daughter’s
birth.There was manifest harshness in ranking children so born with
ordinary illegitimate children; but, in strictness of Law, as Henry
married Anne Boleyn while Katharine of Aragon was alive, the daughter
of Katharine and the daughter of Anne could not both be legitimate.It should also be
remembered that the marriage of Anne Boleyn was declared void, and her
daughter declared illegitimate, on grounds—whatever they were—which had
nothing to do with the earlier question of the marriage and divorce of
Katharine.1, declares it to be treason “yf any person shall in any wyse holde
and affyrme or mayntayne that the Common Lawes of this Realme not
altred by Parlyament, ought not to dyrecte the Ryght of the crowne
of England, or that our said sovrayne Ladye Elizabeth the Quenes
Majestie that nowe is, with and by the aucthoritye of the Parlyament
of Englande is not able to make Lawes and Statutes of suffycyent force
and valyditie to lymit and bynd the Crowne of this Realme, and the
Descent Lymitacion Inheritaunce and Government thereof.” The like is
the crime of “whosoever shall hereafter duryng the Lyef of our said
Soveraigne Ladye, by any Booke or Worke prynted or written, dyrectly
and expresly declare and affyrme at any tyme before the same be by Acte
of Parlyament of this Realme established and affyrmed, that any one
particular person whosover it be, is or ought to be the ryght Heire
and Successor to the Queenes Majestie that nowe is (whome God longe
preserve) except the same be the naturall yssue of her Majesties bodye.”

This statute may possibly be taken as setting aside the claims of the
House of Suffolk; but, if so, it sets aside the claims of the House of
Stewart along with them.(45) James’s right was acknowledged by his own first Parliament, just
as the claims of other Kings who entered in an irregular way had
been.It should be marked however that he was crowned before he was
acknowledged.1, declares that “immediatelie upon
the Dissolution and Decease of Elizabeth late Queene of England, the
Imperiall Crowne of the Realme of England, and of all the Kingdomes
Dominions and Rights belonging to the same, did by inherent Birthright
and lawfull undoubted Succession, descend and come to your moste
excellent Majestie, as beinge lineallie justly and lawfullie next and
sole Heire of the Blood Royall of this Realme as is aforesaid.” It is
worth noticing that in this Act we get the following definition of
Parliament; “this high Court of Parliament, where all the whole Body of
the Realm and every particular member thereof, either in Person or by
Representation (upon their own free elections), are by the Laws of this
Realm deemed to be personally present.”

(46) The fact that James the First, a King who came in with no title
whatever but what was given him by an Act of Parliament passed after
his coronation, was acknowledged without the faintest opposition is
one of the most remarkable things in our history.294)
remarks that “there is much reason to believe that the consciousness of
this defect in his parliamentary title put James on magnifying, still
more than from his natural temper he was prone to do, the inherent
rights of primogenitory succession, as something indefeasible by the
legislature; a doctrine which, however it might suit the schools of
divinity, was in diametrical opposition to our statutes.” Certainly no
opposition can be more strongly marked than that between the language
of James’s own Parliament and the words quoted above from 13 Eliz.But see the remarks of Hallam a few pages before (i.288) on the
kind of tacit election by which it might be said that James reigned.“What renders it absurd to call him and his children usurpers?He had
that which the flatterers of his family most affected to disdain—the
will of the people; not certainly expressed in regular suffrage or
declared election, but unanimously and voluntarily ratifying that which
in itself could surely give no right, the determination of the late
Queen’s Council to proclaim his accession to the throne.”

(47) Whitelocke’s Memorials, 367.“The heads of the charge against the
King were published by leave, in this form: That Charles Stuart, being
admitted King of England, & therein trusted with a limited power, to
govern by, & according to the Laws of the Land, & not otherwise, &
by his trust being obliged, as also by his Oath, & office to use the
power committed to him, for the good & benefit of the people, & for the
preservation of their Rights and Privileges,” etc.At an earlier stage (365) the President had told the King that the
Court “sat here by the Authority of the Commons of England: & all your
predecessours, & you are responsible to them.” The King answered “I
deny that, shew me one Precedent.” The President, instead of quoting
the precedents which were at least plausible, told the prisoner that
he was not to interrupt the Court.Earlier still the King had objected
to the authority of the Court that “he saw no Lords there which should
make a Parliament, including the King, & urged that the Kingdom
of England was hereditary, & not successive.” The strong point of
Charles’s argument undoubtedly was the want of concurrence on the part
of the Lords.Both Houses of Parliament had agreed in the proceedings
against Edward the Second and Richard the Second.It is a small point, but it is well to notice that the description of
the King as Charles Stewart was perfectly accurate.Charles, the son
of James, the son of Henry Stewart Lord Darnley, really had a surname,
though it might not be according to Court etiquette to call him by
it.The helpless French imitators in 1793 summoned their King by the
name of “Louis Capet,” as if Charles had been summoned by the name of
“Unready,” “Bastard,” “Lackland,” “Longshanks,” or any other nickname
of an earlier King and forefather.I believe that many people fancy that Guelph or Welf is a surname of
the present, or rather late, royal family.(48) The Act 1 William and Mary (Revised Statutes, ii.11) entailed the
Crown “after their deceases,” “to the heires of the body of the said
princesse & for default of such issue to the Princesse Anne of Denmarke
& the heires of her body & for default of such issue to the heires of
the body of the said Prince of Orange.” It was only after the death of
“the most hopeful Prince William Duke of Gloucester” that the Crown
was settled (12 and 13 Will.94) on
“the most excellent Princess Sophia Electress and Dutchess Dowager of
Hannover, daughter of the most excellent Princess Elizabeth, late Queen
of Bohemia, daughter of our late sovereign lord King James the First of
happy memory,” “and the heirs of her body being protestants.”

(49) We hardly need assurance of the fact, but if it were needed,
something like an assurance to that effect was given by an official
member of the House during the session of 1872.At all events we
read in Sir T. E. May (ii.83); “The increased power of the House
of Commons, under an improved representation, has been patent and
indisputable.Responsible to the people, it has, at the same time,
wielded the people’s strength.No longer subservient to the crown, the
ministers, and the peerage, it has become the predominant authority
in the state.” But the following strange remark follows: “But it is
characteristic of the British constitution, and _a proof of its
freedom from the spirit of democracy_, that the more dominant the power
of the House of Commons,—the greater has been its respect for the law,
and the more carefully have its acts been restrained within the proper
limits of its own jurisdiction.”

  ὦ δημοκρατία, ταῦτα δῆτ' ἀνασχετά;

Has Mr.Grote lived and written so utterly in vain that a writer widely
indeed removed from the vulgar herd of oligarchic babblers looks on
“the spirit of democracy” as something inconsistent with “respect for
the law”?(50) The story is told (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 7), that King Theopompos,
having submitted to the lessening of the kingly power by that of the
Ephors, was rebuked by his wife, because the power which he handed on
to those who came after him would be less than what he had received
from those who went before him.ὃν καί φασιν ὑπὸ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ γυναικὸς

αὐτήν.The kingdom of the Molossians, referred to in the extract from
Aristotle, is one of those states of antiquity of which we should
be well pleased to hear more.Like the Macedonian kingdom, it was an
instance of the heroic kingship surviving into the historical ages of
Greece.But the Molossian kingship seems to have been more regular and
popular than that of Macedonia, and to have better deserved the name
of a constitutional monarchy.The Molossian people and the Molossian
King exchanged oaths not unlike those of the Landesgemeinde and the
Landammann of Appenzell-Ausserrhoden, the King swearing to rule
according to the laws, and the people swearing to maintain the kingdom
according to the laws.In the end the kingdom changed into a Federal
Republic.(51) It is simply frivolous in the present state of England to discuss
the comparative merits of commonwealths and constitutional monarchies
with any practical object.Constitutional monarchy is not only firmly
fixed in the hearts of the people, but it has some distinct advantages
over republican forms of government, just as republican forms of
government have some advantages over it.It may be doubted whether
the people have not a more real control over the Executive, when the
House of Commons, or, in the last resort, the people itself in the
polling-booths (as in 1868), can displace a Government at any moment,
than they have in constitutions in which an Executive, however much
it may have disappointed the hopes of those who chose it, cannot be
removed before the end of its term of office, except on the legal
proof of some definite crime.But in itself, there really seems no
reason why the form of the Executive Government should not be held
to be as lawful a subject for discussion as the House of Lords, the
Established Church, the standing army, or anything else.It shows
simple ignorance, if it does not show something worse, when the word
“republican” is used as synonymous with cut-throat or pickpocket.I do
not find that in republican countries this kind of language is applied
to the admirers of monarchy; but the people who talk in this way are
just those who have no knowledge of republics either in past history or
in present times.They may very likely have climbed a Swiss mountain,
but they have taken care not to ask what was the constitution of the
country at its foot.They may even have learned to write Greek iambics
and to discuss Greek particles; but they have learned nothing from
the treasures of wisdom taught by Grecian history from Herodotus to
Polybios.I have discussed the three chief forms of executive government, the
constitutional King and his Ministry, the President, and the Executive
Council, in the last of my first series of Historical Essays.250:—

MACMILLAN AND CO., LONDON.The _tibia
longa_ was especially used in religious worship.The _tibia curva_
was curved at its broadest end.The _tibia ligula_ appears to have
resembled our flageolet.The _calamus_ was nothing more than a simple
pipe cut off the kind of reed which the ancients used as a pen for
writing.The Romans had double flutes as well as single flutes.The double flute
consisted of two tubes united, either so as to have a mouth-piece
in common or to have each a separate mouth-piece.If the tubes were
exactly alike the double flute was called _Tibiæ pares_; if they were
different from each other, _Tibiæ impares_.Little plugs, or stoppers,
were inserted into the finger-holes to regulate the order of intervals.The _tibia_ was made in various shapes.The _tibia dextra_ was usually
constructed of the upper and thinner part of a reed; and the _tibia
sinistra_, of the lower and broader part.The performers used also the
_capistrum_,--a bandage round the cheeks identical with the _phorbeia_
of the Greeks.The British museum contains a mosaic figure of a Roman girl playing
the _tibia_, which is stated to have been disinterred in the year 1823
on the Via Appia.Here the _holmos_ or mouth-piece, somewhat resembling
the reed of our oboe, is distinctly shown.The finger-holes, probably
four, are not indicated, although they undoubtedly existed on the
instrument.[Illustration]

Furthermore, the Romans had two kinds of Pandean pipes, viz.the
_syrinx_ and the _fistula_.The bagpipe, _tibia utricularis_, is said
to have been a favourite instrument of the emperor Nero.[Illustration]

The _cornu_ was a large horn of bronze, curved.The performer held
it under his arm with the broad end upwards over his shoulder.It is
represented in the engraving, with the _tuba_ and the _lituus_.The _tuba_ was a straight trumpet.Both the _cornu_ and the _tuba_
were employed in war to convey signals.The same was the case with the
_buccina_,--originally perhaps a conch shell, and afterwards a simple
horn of an animal,--and the _lituus_, which was bent at the broad end
but otherwise straight.The _tympanum_ resembled the tambourine and was
beaten like the latter with the hands.Among the Roman instruments
of percussion the _scabillum_, which consisted of two plates combined
by means of a sort of hinge, deserves to be noticed; it was fastened
under the foot and trodden in time, to produce certain rhythmical
effects in musical performances.The _cymbalum_ consisted of two metal
plates similar to our cymbals.The _crotala_ and the _crusmata_ were
kinds of castanets, the former being oblong and of a larger size than
the latter.The Romans had also a _triangulum_, which resembled the
triangle occasionally used in our orchestra.The _sistrum_ they derived
from Egypt with the introduction of the worship of Isis.Metal bells,
arranged according to a regular order of intervals and placed in a
frame, were called _tintinnabula_.The _crepitaculum_ appears to have
been a somewhat similar contrivance on a hoop with a handle.Through the Greeks and Romans we have the first well-authenticated
proof of musical instruments having been introduced into Europe from
Asia.The Romans in their conquests undoubtedly made their musical
instruments known, to some extent, also in western Europe.But the
Greeks and Romans are not the only nations which introduced eastern
instruments into Europe.The Phœnicians at an early period colonized
Sardinia, and traces of them are still to be found on that island.Among these is a peculiarly constructed double-pipe, called _lionedda_
or _launedda_.Again, at a much later period the Arabs introduced
several of their instruments into Spain, from which country they became
known in France, Germany, and England.Also the crusaders, during the
eleventh and twelfth centuries, may have helped to familiarize the
western European nations with instruments of the east.CHAPTER V.


THE CHINESE.Allowing for any exaggeration as to chronology, natural to the lively
imagination of Asiatics, there is no reason to doubt that the Chinese
possessed long before our Christian era musical instruments to which
they attribute a fabulously high antiquity.There is an ancient
tradition, according to which they obtained their musical scale from
a miraculous bird, called foung-hoang, which appears to have been a
sort of phœnix.When Confucius, who lived about B.C.500, happened to
hear on a certain occasion some Chinese music, he became so greatly
enraptured that he could not take any food for three months afterwards.The sounds which produced this effect were those of Kouei, the Orpheus
of the Chinese, whose performance on the _king_--a kind of harmonicon
constructed of slabs of sonorous stone--would draw wild animals around
him and make them subservient to his will.As regards the invention of
musical instruments the Chinese have other traditions.In one of these
we are told that the origin of some of their most popular instruments
dates from the period when China was under the dominion of heavenly
spirits, called Ki.Another assigns the invention of several stringed
instruments to the great Fohi who was the founder of the empire and
who lived about B.C.3000, which was long after the dominion of the
Ki, or spirits.Again, another tradition holds that the most important
instruments and systematic arrangements of sounds are an invention of
Niuva, a supernatural female, who lived at the time of Fohi.[Illustration]

According to their records, the Chinese possessed their much-esteemed
_king_ 2200 years before our Christian era, and employed it for
accompanying songs of praise.During religious observances at the solemn moment when the _king_ was
sounded sticks of incense were burnt.It was likewise played before
the emperor early in the morning when he awoke.The Chinese have long
since constructed various kinds of the _king_, one of which is here
engraved, by using different species of stones.Their most famous stone
selected for this purpose is called _yu_.It is not only very sonorous
but also beautiful in appearance.The _yu_ is found in mountain streams
and crevices of rocks.The largest specimens found measure from two to
three feet in diameter, but of this size examples rarely occur.The
_yu_ is very hard and heavy.Some European mineralogists, to whom the
missionaries transmitted specimens for examination, pronounce it to be
a species of agate.It is found of different colours, and the Chinese
appear to have preferred in different centuries particular colours for
the _king_.The Chinese consider the _yu_ especially valuable for musical purposes,
because it always retains exactly the same pitch.All other musical
instruments, they say, are in this respect doubtful; but the tone of
the _yu_ is neither influenced by cold nor heat, nor by humidity, nor
dryness.The stones used for the _king_ have been cut from time to time in
various grotesque shapes.Some represent animals: as, for instance, a
bat with outstretched wings; or two fishes placed side by side: others
are in the shape of an ancient Chinese bell.The angular shape shown
in the engraving appears to be the oldest and is still retained in the
ornamented stones of the _pien-king_, which is a more modern instrument
than the _king_.The tones of the _pien-king_ are attuned according
to the Chinese intervals called _lu_, of which there are twelve in
the compass of an octave.The same is the case with the other Chinese
instruments of this class.The pitch of
the _soung-king_, for instance, is four intervals lower than that of
the _pien-king_.Sonorous stones have always been used by the Chinese also singly, as
rhythmical instruments.Such a single stone is called _tse-king_.Probably certain curious relics belonging to a temple in Peking,
erected for the worship of Confucius, serve a similar purpose.In one
of the outbuildings or the temple are ten sonorous stones, shaped like
drums, which are asserted to have been cut about three thousand years
ago.The primitive Chinese characters engraven upon them are nearly
obliterated.The ancient Chinese had several kinds of bells, frequently arranged in
sets so as to constitute a musical scale.The Chinese name for the bell
is _tchung_.At an early period they had a somewhat square-shaped bell
called _té-tchung_.Like other ancient Chinese bells it was made of
copper alloyed with tin, the proportion being one pound of tin to six
of copper.The _té-tchung_, which is also known by the name of _piao_,
was principally used to indicate the time and divisions in musical
performances.It had a fixed pitch of sound, and several of these bells
attuned to a certain order of intervals were not unfrequently ranged
in a regular succession, thus forming a musical instrument which was
called _pien-tchung_.The musical scale of the sixteen bells which
the _pien-tchung_ contained was the same as that of the _king_ before
mentioned.[Illustration]

The _hiuen-tchung_ was, according to popular tradition, included with
the antique instruments at the time of Confucius, and came into popular
use during the Han dynasty (from B.C.It was of
a peculiar oval shape and had nearly the same quaint ornamentation
as the _té-tchung_; this consisted of symbolical figures, in four
divisions, each containing nine mammals.Every figure had a deep meaning referring to the seasons and to the
mysteries of the Buddhist religion.The largest _hiuen-tchung_ was
about twenty inches in length; and, like the _té-tchung_, was sounded
by means of a small wooden mallet with an oval knob.None of the bells
of this description had a clapper.It would, however, appear that the
Chinese had at an early period some kind of bell provided with a wooden
tongue: this was used for military purposes as well as for calling the
people together when an imperial messenger promulgated his sovereign’s
commands.An expression of Confucius is recorded to the effect that
he wished to be “A wooden-tongued bell of Heaven,” _i.e._ a herald of
heaven to proclaim the divine purposes to the multitude.[Illustration]

The _fang-hiang_ was a kind of wood-harmonicon.It contained sixteen
wooden slabs of an oblong square shape, suspended in a wooden frame
elegantly decorated.The slabs were arranged in two tiers, one above
the other, and were all of equal length and breadth but differed in
thickness.The _tchoung-tou_ consisted of twelve slips of bamboo, and
was used for beating time and for rhythmical purposes.The slips being
banded together at one end could be expanded somewhat like a fan.The
Chinese state that they used the _tchoung-tou_ for writing upon before
they invented paper.The _ou_, of which we give a woodcut, likewise an ancient Chinese
instrument of percussion and still in use, is made of wood in the shape
of a crouching tiger.It is hollow, and along its back are about twenty
small pieces of metal, pointed, and in appearance not unlike the teeth
of a saw.The performer strikes them with a sort of plectrum resembling
a brush, or with a small stick called _tchen_.Occasionally the _ou_ is
made with pieces of metal shaped like reeds.[Illustration]

The ancient _ou_ was constructed with only six tones which were
attuned thus--_f_, _g_, _a_, _c_, _d_, _f_.The instrument appears
to have become deteriorated in the course of time; for, although
it has gradually acquired as many as twenty-seven pieces of metal,
it evidently serves at the present day more for the production of
rhythmical noise than for the execution of any melody.The modern _ou_
is made of a species of wood called _kieou_ or _tsieou_: and the tiger
rests generally on a hollow wooden pedestal about three feet six inches
long, which serves as a sound-board.[Illustration]

The _tchou_, likewise an instrument of percussion, was made of the
wood of a tree called _kieou-mou_, the stem of which resembles that of
the pine and whose foliage is much like that of the cypress.It was
constructed of boards about three-quarters of an inch in thickness.In
the middle of one of the sides was an aperture into which the hand was
passed for the purpose of holding the handle of a wooden hammer, the
end of which entered into a hole situated in the bottom of the _tchou_.The handle was kept in its place by means of a wooden pin, on which it
moved right and left when the instrument was struck with a hammer.The
Chinese ascribe to the _tchou_ a very high antiquity, as they almost
invariably do with any of their inventions when the date of its origin
is unknown to them.The _po-fou_ was a drum, about one foot four inches in length, and
seven inches in diameter.It had a parchment at each end, which was
prepared in a peculiar way by being boiled in water.The _po-fou_ used
to be partly filled with a preparation made from the husk of rice, in
order to mellow the sound.The Chinese name for the drum is _kou_.[Illustration]

The _kin-kou_ (engraved), a large drum fixed on a pedestal which raises
it above six feet from the ground, is embellished with symbolical
designs.A similar drum on which natural phenomena are depicted is
called _lei-kou_; and another of the kind, with figures of certain
birds and beasts which are regarded as symbols of long life, is called
_ling-kou_, and also _lou-kou_.The flutes, _ty_, _yo_, and _tché_ were generally made of bamboo.The
_koan-tsee_ was a Pandean pipe containing twelve tubes of bamboo.The _siao_, likewise a Pandean pipe, contained sixteen tubes.The
_pai-siao_ differed from the _siao_ inasmuch as the tubes were inserted
into an oddly-shaped case highly ornamented with grotesque designs and
silken appendages.[Illustration]

The Chinese are known to have constructed at an early period a curious
wind-instrument, called _hiuen_.It was made of baked clay and had five
finger-holes, three of which were placed on one side and two on the
opposite side, as in the cut.Its tones were in conformity with the
pentatonic scale.The reader unacquainted with the pentatonic scale may
ascertain its character by playing on the pianoforte the scale of C
major with the omission of _f_ and _b_ (the _fourth_ and _seventh_); or
by striking the black keys in regular succession from _f_-sharp to the
next _f_-sharp above or below.Another curious wind-instrument of high antiquity, the _cheng_,
(engraved, p.Formerly it had either 13, 19, or
24 tubes, placed in a calabash; and a long curved tube served as a
mouth-piece.In olden time it was called _yu_.The ancient stringed instruments, the _kin_ and _chê_, were of the
dulcimer kind: they are still in use, and specimens of them are in the
South Kensington museum.The Buddhists introduced from Thibet into China their god of music,
who is represented as a rather jovial-looking man with a moustache
and an imperial, playing the _pepa_, a kind of lute with four silken
strings.Perhaps some interesting information respecting the ancient
Chinese musical instruments may be gathered from the famous ruins of
the Buddhist temples _Ongcor-Wat_ and _Ongcor-Thôm_, in Cambodia.These splendid ruins are supposed to be above two thousand years old:
and, at any rate, the circumstance of their age not being known to the
Cambodians suggests a high antiquity.On the bas-reliefs with which the
temples were enriched are figured musical instruments, which European
travellers describe as “flutes, organs, trumpets, and drums, resembling
those of the Chinese.” Faithful sketches of these representations
might, very likely, afford valuable hints to the student of musical
history.[Illustration]

In the Brahmin mythology of the Hindus the god Nareda is the inventor
of the _vina_, the principal national instrument of Hindustan.Saraswati, the consort of Brahma, may be regarded as the Minerva of
the Hindus.She is the goddess of music as well as of speech; to her
is attributed the invention of the systematic arrangement of the
sounds into a musical scale.She is represented seated on a peacock
and playing on a stringed instrument of the lute kind.Brahma himself
we find depicted as a vigorous man with four handsome heads, beating
with his hands upon a small drum; and Vishnu, in his incarnation as
Krishna, is represented as a beautiful youth playing upon a flute.The
Hindus construct a peculiar kind of flute, which they consider as the
favourite instrument of Krishna.They have also the divinity Ganesa,
the god of Wisdom, who is represented as a man with the head of an
elephant, holding a _tamboura_ in his hands.It is a suggestive fact that we find among several nations in different
parts of the world an ancient tradition, according to which their most
popular stringed instrument was originally derived from the water.In Hindu mythology the god Nareda invented the _vina_--the principal
national instrument of Hindustan--which has also the name _cach’-hapi_,
signifying a tortoise (_testudo_).Moreover, _nara_ denotes in Sanskrit
water, and _narada_, or _nareda_, the giver of water.Like Nareda,
Nereus and his fifty daughters, the Nereides, were much renowned for
their musical accomplishments; and Hermes (it will be remembered) made
his lyre, the _chelys_, of a tortoise-shell.The Scandinavian god Odin,
the originator of magic songs, is mentioned as the ruler of the sea,
and as such he had the name of _Nikarr_.In the depth of the sea he
played the harp with his subordinate spirits, who occasionally came up
to the surface of the water to teach some favoured human being their
wonderful instrument.Wäinämöinen, the divine player on the Finnish
_kantele_ (according to the Kalewala, the old national epic of the
Finns) constructed his instrument of fish-bones.The frame he made out
of the bones of the pike; and the teeth of the pike he used for the
tuning-pegs.Jacob Grimm in his work on German mythology points out an old
tradition, preserved in Swedish and Scotch national ballads, of a
skilful harper who constructs his instrument out of the bones of a
young girl drowned by a wicked woman.Her fingers he uses for the
tuning screws, and her golden hair for the strings.The harper plays,
and his music kills the murderess.A similar story is told in the old
Icelandic national songs; and the same tradition has been preserved in
the Faroe islands, as well as in Norway and Denmark.May not the agreeable impression produced by the rhythmical flow of
the waves and the soothing murmur of running water have led various
nations, independently of each other, to the widespread conception that
they obtained their favourite instrument of music from the water?Or is
the notion traceable to a common source dating from a pre-historic age,
perhaps from the early period when the Aryan race is surmised to have
diffused its lore through various countries?Or did it originate in the
old belief that the world, with all its charms and delights, arose from
a chaos in which water constituted the predominant element?Howbeit, Nareda, the giver of water, was evidently also the ruler of
the clouds; and Odin had his throne in the skies.Indeed, many of the
musical water-spirits appear to have been originally considered as rain
deities.Their music may therefore be regarded as derived from the
clouds rather than from the sea.In short, the traditions respecting
spirits and water are not in contradiction to the opinion of the
ancient Hindus that music is of heavenly origin, but rather tend to
support it.The earliest musical instruments of the Hindus on record have, almost
all of them, remained in popular use until the present day scarcely
altered.Besides these, the Hindus possess several Arabic and Persian
instruments which are of comparatively modern date in Hindustan:
evidently having been introduced into that country scarcely a thousand
years ago, at the time of the Mahomedan irruption.There is a treatise
on music extant, written in Sanskrit, which contains a description of
the ancient instruments.Its title is _Sângita râthnakara_.If, as
may be hoped, it be translated by a Sanskrit scholar who is at the
same time a good musician, we shall probably be enabled to ascertain
more exactly which of the Hindu instruments of the present day are of
comparatively modern origin.The _vina_ is undoubtedly of high antiquity.It has seven wire strings,
and movable frets which are generally fastened with wax.Two hollowed
gourds, often tastefully ornamented, are affixed to it for the purpose
of increasing the sonorousness.There are several kinds of the _vina_
in different districts; but that represented in the illustration
is regarded as the oldest.The performer shown is Jeewan Shah, a
celebrated virtuoso on the _vina_, who lived about a hundred years ago.The Hindus divided their musical scale into several intervals smaller
than our modern semitones.They adopted twenty-two intervals called
_sruti_ in the compass of an octave, which may therefore be compared
to our chromatic intervals.As the frets of the _vina_ are movable the
performer can easily regulate them according to the scale, or mode,
which he requires for his music.[Illustration]

The harp, _chang_, has become almost obsolete.If some Hindu drawings
of it can be relied upon, it had at an early time a triangular frame
and was in construction as well as in shape and size almost identical
with the Assyrian harp.The Hindus claim to have invented the violin bow.They maintain that
the _ravanastron_, one of their old instruments played with the bow,
was invented about five thousand years ago by Ravanon, a mighty king
of Ceylon.However this may be there is a great probability that the
fiddle-bow originated in Hindustan; because Sanskrit scholars inform
us that there are names for it in works which cannot be less than
from 1500 to 2000 years old.The non-occurrence of any instrument
played with a bow on the monuments of the nations of antiquity is
by no means so sure a proof as has generally been supposed, that the
bow was unknown.The fiddle in its primitive condition must have been
a poor contrivance.It probably was despised by players who could
produce better tones with greater facility by twanging the strings
with their fingers, or with a plectrum.Thus it may have remained
through many centuries without experiencing any material improvement.It must also be borne in mind that the monuments transmitted to us
chiefly represent historical events, religious ceremonies, and royal
entertainments.On such occasions instruments of a certain kind only
were used, and these we find represented; while others, which may
have been even more common, never occur.In two thousand years’ time
people will possibly maintain that some highly perfected instrument
popular with them was entirely unknown to us, because it is at present
in so primitive a condition that no one hardly notices it.If the
_ravanastron_ was an importation of the Mahomedans it would most likely
bear some resemblance to the Arabian and Persian instruments, and it
would be found rather in the hands of the higher classes in the towns;
whereas it is principally met with among the lower order of people, in
isolated and mountainous districts.It is further remarkable that the
most simple kind of _ravanastron_ is almost identical with the Chinese
fiddle called _ur-heen_.This species has only two strings, and its
body consists of a small block of wood, hollowed out and covered with
the skin of a serpent.The _ur-heen_ has not been mentioned among the
most ancient instruments of the Chinese, since there is no evidence of
its having been known in China before the introduction of the Buddhist
religion into that country.From indications, which to point out would
lead too far here, it would appear that several instruments found
in China originated in Hindustan.They seem to have been gradually
diffused from Hindustan and Thibet, more or less altered in the course
of time, through the east as far as Japan.Another curious Hindu instrument, probably of very high antiquity,
is the _poongi_, also called _toumrie_ and _magoudi_.It consists
of a gourd or of the Cuddos nut, hollowed, into which two pipes are
inserted.The _poongi_ therefore somewhat resembles in appearance a
bagpipe.It is generally used by the _Sampuris_ or snake charmers,
who play upon it when they exhibit the antics of the cobra.The name
_magoudi_, given in certain districts to this instrument, rather
tends to corroborate the opinion of some musical historians that the
_magadis_ of the ancient Greeks was a sort of double-pipe, or bagpipe.Many instruments of Hindustan are known by different names in different
districts; and, besides, there are varieties of them.On the whole, the
Hindus possess about fifty instruments.To describe them properly would
fill a volume.Some, which are in the Kensington museum, will be found
noticed in the large catalogue of that collection.THE PERSIANS AND ARABS.Of the musical instruments of the ancient Persians, before the
Christian era, scarcely anything is known.It may be surmised that they
closely resembled those of the Assyrians, and probably also those of
the Hebrews.[Illustration]

The harp, _chang_, in olden time a favourite instrument of the
Persians, has gradually fallen into desuetude.The illustration of a
small harp given in the woodcut has been sketched from the celebrated
sculptures, perhaps of the sixth century, which exist on a stupendous
rock, called Tackt-i-Bostan, in the vicinity of the town of Kermanshah.These sculptures are said to have been executed during the lifetime
of the Persian monarch Khosroo Purviz.They form the ornaments of
two lofty arches, and consist of representations of field sports
and aquatic amusements.In one of the boats is seated a man in an
ornamental dress, with a halo round his head, who is receiving an
arrow from one of his attendants; while a female, who is sitting
near him, plays on a Trigonon.Towards the top of the bas-relief
is represented a stage, on which are performers on small straight
trumpets and little hand drums; six harpers; and four other musicians,
apparently females,--the first of whom plays a flute; the second,
a sort of pandean pipe; the third, an instrument which is too much
defaced to be recognizable; and the fourth, a bagpipe.Two harps of a
peculiar shape were copied by Sir Gore Ousely from Persian manuscripts
about four hundred years old resembling, in the principle on which they
are constructed, all other oriental harps.There existed evidently
various kinds of the _chang_.It may be remarked here that the
instrument _tschenk_ (or _chang_) in use at the present day in Persia,
is more like a dulcimer than a harp.The Arabs adopted the harp from
the Persians, and called it _junk_.An interesting representation of a
Turkish woman playing the harp (p.53) sketched from life by Melchior
Lorich in the seventeenth century, probably exhibits an old Persian
_chang_; for the Turks derived their music principally from Persia.Here we have an introduction into Europe of the oriental frame without
a front pillar.[Illustration]

The Persians appear to have adopted, at an early period, smaller
musical intervals than semitones.When the Arabs conquered Persia (A.D.641) the Persians had already attained a higher degree of civilisation
than their conquerors.The latter found in Persia the cultivation of
music considerably in advance of their own, and the musical instruments
superior also.They soon adopted the Persian instruments, and there
can be no doubt that the musical system exhibited by the earliest
Arab writers whose works on the theory of music have been preserved
was based upon an older system of the Persians.In these works the
octave is divided in seventeen _one-third-tones_--intervals which are
still made use of in the east.Some of the Arabian instruments are
constructed so as to enable the performer to produce the intervals
with exactness.The frets on the lute and tamboura, for instance, are
regulated with a view to this object.[Illustration]

The Arabs had to some extent become acquainted with many of the
Persian instruments before the time of their conquest of Persia.An
Arab musician of the name of Nadr Ben el-Hares Ben Kelde is recorded
as having been sent to the Persian king Khosroo Purviz, in the sixth
century, for the purpose of learning Persian singing and performing
on the lute.Through him, it is said, the lute was brought to Mekka.Saib Chatir, the son of a Persian, is spoken of as the first performer
on the lute in Medina, A.D.682; and of an Arab lutist, Ebn Soreidsch
from Mekka, A.D.683, it is especially mentioned that he played in the
Persian style; evidently the superior one.The lute, _el-oud_, had
before the tenth century only four strings, or four pairs producing
four tones, each tone having two strings tuned in unison.About the
tenth century a string for a fifth tone was added.The strings were
made of silk neatly twisted.The neck of the instrument was provided
with frets of string, which were carefully regulated according to
the system of seventeen intervals in the compass of an octave before
mentioned.Other favourite stringed instruments were the _tamboura_,
a kind of lute with a long neck, and the _kanoon_, a kind of dulcimer
strung with lamb’s gut strings (generally three in unison for each
tone) and played upon with two little plectra which the performer had
fastened to his fingers.The _kanoon_ is likewise still in use in
countries inhabited by Mahomedans.The engraving, taken from a Persian
painting at Teheran, represents an old Persian _santir_, the prototype
of our dulcimer, mounted with wire strings and played upon with two
slightly curved sticks.[Illustration]

Al-Farabi, one of the earliest Arabian musical theorists known, who
lived in the beginning of the tenth century, does not allude to the
fiddle-bow.This is noteworthy inasmuch as it seems in some measure
to support the opinion maintained by some historians that the bow
originated in England or Wales.Unfortunately we possess no exact
descriptions of the Persian and Arabian instruments between the tenth
and fourteenth centuries, otherwise we should probably have earlier
accounts of some instrument of the violin kind in Persia.Ash-shakandi,
who lived in Spain about A.D.1200, mentions the _rebab_, which may
have been in use for centuries without having been thought worthy of
notice on account of its rudeness.Persian writers of the fourteenth
century speak of two instruments of the violin class, viz., the _rebab_
and the _kemangeh_.As regards the _kemangeh_, the Arabs themselves
assert that they obtained it from Persia, and their statement appears
all the more worthy of belief from the fact that both names, _rebab_
and _kemangeh_, are originally Persian.We engrave the _rebab_ from an
example at South Kensington.[Illustration]

The _nay_, a flute, and the _surnay_, a species of oboe, are still
popular in the east.The Arabs must have been indefatigable constructors of musical
instruments.Kiesewetter gives a list of above two hundred names of
Arabian instruments, and this does not include many known to us through
Spanish historians.A careful investigation of the musical instruments
of the Arabs during their sojourn in Spain is particularly interesting
to the student of mediæval music, inasmuch as it reveals the eastern
origin of many instruments which are generally regarded as European
inventions.Introduced into Spain by the Saracens and the Moors they
were gradually diffused towards northern Europe.The English, for
instance, adopted not only the Moorish dance (morrice dance) but also
the _kuitra_ (gittern), the _el-oud_ (lute), the _rebab_ (rebec), the
_nakkarah_ (naker), and several others.In an old Cornish sacred drama,
supposed to date from the fourteenth century, we have in an enumeration
of musical instruments the _nakrys_, designating “kettle-drums.” It
must be remembered that the Cornish language, which has now become
obsolete, was nearly akin to the Welsh.Indeed, names of musical
instruments derived from the Moors in Spain occur in almost every
European language.Not a few fanciful stories are traditionally preserved among the Arabs
testifying to the wonderful effects they ascribed to the power of their
instrumental performances.Al-Farabi had
acquired his proficiency in Spain, in one of the schools at Cordova
which flourished as early as towards the end of the ninth century: and
his reputation became so great that ultimately it extended to Asia.The mighty caliph of Bagdad himself desired to hear the celebrated
musician, and sent messengers to Spain with instructions to offer rich
presents to him and to convey him to the court.But Al-Farabi feared
that if he went he should be retained in Asia, and should never again
see the home to which he felt deeply attached.At last he resolved
to disguise himself, and ventured to undertake the journey which
promised him a rich harvest.Dressed in a mean costume, he made his
appearance at the court just at the time when the caliph was being
entertained with his daily concert.Al-Farabi, unknown to everyone, was
permitted to exhibit his skill on the lute.Scarcer had he commenced
his performance in a certain musical mode when he set all his audience
laughing aloud, notwithstanding the efforts of the courtiers to
suppress so unbecoming an exhibition of mirth in the royal presence.In
truth, even the caliph himself was compelled to burst out into a fit
of laughter.Presently the performer changed to another mode, and the
effect was that immediately all his hearers began to sigh, and soon
tears of sadness replaced the previous tears of mirth.Again he played
in another mode, which excited his audience to such a rage that they
would have fought each other if he, seeing the danger, had not directly
gone over to an appeasing mode.After this wonderful exhibition of his
skill Al-Farabi concluded in a mode which had the effect of making
his listeners fall into a profound sleep, during which he took his
departure.It will be seen that this incident is almost identical with one
recorded as having happened about twelve hundred years earlier at the
court of Alexander the great, and which forms the subject of Dryden’s
“Alexander’s Feast.” The distinguished flutist Timotheus successively
aroused and subdued different passions by changing the musical modes
during his performance, exactly in the same way as did Al-Farabi.If the preserved antiquities of the American Indians, dating from a
period anterior to our discovery of the western hemisphere, possess
an extraordinary interest because they afford trustworthy evidence
of the degree of progress which the aborigines had attained in the
cultivation of the arts and in their social condition before they came
in contact with Europeans, it must be admitted that the ancient musical
instruments of the American Indians are also worthy of examination.Several of them are constructed in a manner which, in some degree,
reveals the characteristics of the musical system prevalent among the
people who used the instruments.And although most of these interesting
relics, which have been obtained from tombs and other hiding-places,
may not be of great antiquity, it has been satisfactorily ascertained
that they are genuine contrivances of the Indians before they were
influenced by European civilization.Some account of these relics is therefore likely to prove of interest
also to the ethnologist, especially as several facts may perhaps be
found of assistance in elucidating the still unsolved problem as to the
probable original connection of the American with Asiatic races.Among the instruments of the Aztecs in Mexico and of the Peruvians
none have been found so frequently, and have been preserved in their
former condition so unaltered, as pipes and flutes.They are generally
made of pottery or of bone, substances which are unsuitable for the
construction of most other instruments, but which are remarkably
well qualified to withstand the decaying influence of time.There
is, therefore, no reason to conclude from the frequent occurrence of
such instruments that they were more common than other kinds of which
specimens have rarely been discovered.[Illustration]

The Mexicans possessed a small whistle formed of baked clay, a
considerable number of which have been found.Some specimens (of which
we give engravings) are singularly grotesque in shape, representing
caricatures of the human face and figure, birds, beasts, and flowers.Some were provided at the top with a finger-hole which, when closed,
altered the pitch of the sound, so that two different tones were
producible on the instrument.Others had a little ball of baked clay
lying loose inside the air-chamber.When the instrument was blown the
current of air set the ball in a vibrating motion, thereby causing a
shrill and whirring sound.A similar contrivance is sometimes made
use of by Englishmen for conveying signals.The Mexican whistle most
likely served principally the same purpose, but it may possibly have
been used also in musical entertainments.In the Russian horn band
each musician is restricted to a single tone; and similar combinations
of performers--only, of course, much more rude--have been witnessed by
travellers among some tribes in Africa and America.[Illustration]

Rather more complete than the above specimens are some of the whistles
and small pipes which have been found in graves of the Indians of
Chiriqui in central America.The pipe or whistle which is represented
in the accompanying engraving appears, to judge from the somewhat
obscure description transmitted to us, to possess about half a dozen
tones.It is of pottery, painted in red and black on a cream-
ground, and in length about five inches.Among the instruments of this
kind from central America the most complete have four finger-holes.By means of three the following four sounds (including the sound
which is produced when none of the holes are closed) can be emitted:
[Illustration] the fourth finger-hole, when closed, has the effect of
lowering the pitch a semitone.By a particular process two or three
lower notes are obtainable.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The pipe of the Aztecs, which is called by the Mexican Spaniards
_pito_, somewhat resembled our flageolet: the material was a reddish
pottery, and it was provided with four finger-holes.Although among
about half a dozen specimens which the writer has examined some are
considerably larger than others they all have, singularly enough, the
same pitch of sound.The smallest is about six inches in length, and
the largest about nine inches.Several _pitos_ have been found in a
remarkably well-preserved condition.They are easy to blow, and their
order of intervals is in conformity with the pentatonic scale, thus:
[Illustration] The usual shape of the _pito_ is that here represented;
showing the upper side of one pipe, and a side view of another.A
specimen of a less common shape, also engraved, is in the British
museum.Indications suggestive of the popular estimation in which the
flute (or perhaps, more strictly speaking, the pipe) was held by the
Aztecs are not wanting.It was played in religious observances and
we find it referred to allegorically in orations delivered on solemn
occasions.For instance, at the religious festival which was held in
honour of Tezcatlepoca--a divinity depicted as a handsome youth, and
considered second only to the supreme being--a young man was sacrificed
who, in preparation for the ceremony, had been instructed in the art of
playing the flute.Twenty days before his death four young girls, named
after the principal goddesses, were given to him as companions; and
when the hour arrived in which he was to be sacrificed he observed the
established symbolical rite of breaking a flute on each of the steps,
as he ascended the temple.Again, at the public ceremonies which took place on the accession of
a prince to the throne the new monarch addressed a prayer to the god,
in which occurred the following allegorical expression:--“I am thy
flute; reveal to me thy will; breathe into me thy breath like into a
flute, as thou hast done to my predecessors on the throne.As thou
hast opened their eyes, their ears, and their mouth to utter what is
good, so likewise do to me.I resign myself entirely to thy guidance.”
Similar sentences occur in the orations addressed to the monarch.In
reading them one can hardly fail to be reminded of Hamlet’s reflections
addressed to Guildenstern, when the servile courtier expresses his
inability to “govern the ventages” of the pipe and to make the
instrument “discourse most eloquent music,” which the prince bids him
to do.M. de Castelnau in his “Expédition dans l’Amérique” gives among the
illustrations of objects discovered in ancient Peruvian tombs a flute
made of a human bone.It has four finger-holes at its upper surface
and appears to have been blown into at one end.Two bone-flutes, in
appearance similar to the engraving given by M. de Castelnau, which
have been disinterred at Truxillo are deposited in the British museum.They are about six inches in length, and each is provided with five
finger-holes.One of these has all the holes at its upper side, and one
of the holes is considerably smaller than the rest.The specimen which
we engrave (p.64) is ornamented with some simple designs in black.The other has four holes at its upper side and one underneath, the
latter being placed near to the end at which the instrument evidently
was blown.In the aperture of this end some remains of a hardened
paste, or resinous substance, are still preserved.This substance
probably was inserted for the purpose of narrowing the end of the
tube, in order to facilitate the producing of the sounds.The same
contrivance is still resorted to in the construction of the bone-flutes
by some Indian tribes in Guiana.The bones of slain enemies appear
to have been considered especially appropriate for such flutes.The
Araucanians, having killed a prisoner, made flutes of his bones, and
danced and “thundered out their dreadful war-songs, accompanied by the
mournful sounds of these horrid instruments.” Alonso de Ovalle says
of the Indians in Chili: “Their flutes, which they play upon in their
dances, are made of the bones of the Spaniards and other enemies whom
they have overcome in war.This they do by way of triumph and glory for
their victory.They make them likewise of bones of animals; but the
warriors dance only to the flutes made of their enemies.” The Mexicans
and Peruvians obviously possessed a great variety of pipes and flutes,
some of which are still in use among certain Indian tribes.Those which
were found in the famous ruins at Palenque are deposited in the museum
in Mexico.They are:--The _cuyvi_, a pipe on which only five tones
were producible; the _huayllaca_, a sort of flageolet; the _pincullu_,
a flute; and the _chayna_, which is described as “a flute whose
lugubrious and melancholy tones filled the heart with indescribable
sadness, and brought involuntary tears into the eyes.” It was perhaps a
kind of oboe.[Illustration]

The Peruvians had the syrinx, which they called _huayra-puhura_.Some
clue to the proper meaning of this name may perhaps be gathered from
the word _huayra_, which signifies “air.” The _huayra-puhura_ was made
of cane, and also of stone.Sometimes an embroidery of needle-work was
attached to it as an ornament.One specimen which has been disinterred
is adorned with twelve figures precisely resembling Maltese crosses.The cross is a figure which may readily be supposed to suggest itself
very naturally; and it is therefore not so surprising, as it may appear
at a first glance, that the American Indians used it not unfrequently
in designs and sculptures before they came in contact with Christians.[Illustration]

The British museum possesses a _huayra-puhura_ consisting of fourteen
reed pipes of a brownish colour, tied together in two rows by means
of thread, so as to form a double set of seven reeds.Both sets are
almost exactly of the same dimensions and are placed side by side.The
shortest of these reeds measure three inches, and the longest six and
a half.In one set they are open at the bottom, and in the other they
are closed.The reader is probably
aware that the closing of a pipe at the end raises its pitch an octave.Thus, in our organ, the so-called stopped diapason, a set of closed
pipes, requires tubes of only half the length of those which constitute
the open diapason, although both these stops produce tones in the same
pitch; the only difference between them being the quality of sound,
which in the former is less bright than in the latter.The tones yielded by the _huayra-puhura_ in question are as follows:
[Illustration] The highest octave is indistinct, owing to some injury
done to the shortest tubes; but sufficient evidence remains to show
that the intervals were purposely arranged according to the pentatonic
scale.This interesting relic was brought to light from a tomb at Arica.[Illustration]

Another _huayra-puhura_, likewise still yielding sounds, was discovered
placed over a corpse in a Peruvian tomb, and was procured by the French
general, Paroissien.This instrument is made of a greenish stone which
is a species of talc, and contains eight pipes.In the Berlin museum
may be seen a good plaster cast taken from this curious relic.The
height is 5⅜ inches, and its width 6¼ inches.Four of the tubes
have small lateral finger-holes which, when closed, lower the pitch a
semitone.These holes are on the second, fourth, sixth, and seventh
pipe, as shown in the engraving.When the holes are open, the tones
are: [Illustration] and when they are closed: [Illustration] The other
tubes have unalterable tones.The following notation exhibits all the
tones producible on the instrument:

[Illustration]

The musician is likely to speculate what could have induced the
Peruvians to adopt so strange a series of intervals: it seems rather
arbitrary than premeditated.[Illustration]

If (and this seems not to be improbable) the Peruvians considered those
tones which are produced by closing the lateral holes as additional
intervals only, a variety of scales or kinds of _modes_ may have been
contrived by the admission of one or other of these tones among the
essential ones.If we may conjecture from some remarks of Garcilasso
de la Vega, and other historians, the Peruvians appear to have used
different orders of intervals for different kinds of tunes, in a way
similar to what we find to be the case with certain Asiatic nations.We
are told for instance “Each poem, or song, had its appropriate tune,
and they could not put two different songs to one tune; and this was
why the enamoured gallant, making music at night on his flute, with the
tune which belonged to it, told the lady and all the world the joy or
sorrow of his soul, the favour or ill-will which he possessed; so that
it might be said that he spoke by the flute.” Thus also the Hindus have
certain tunes for certain seasons and fixed occasions, and likewise a
number of different modes or scales used for particular kinds of songs.Trumpets are often mentioned by writers who have recorded the manners
and customs of the Indians at the time of the discovery of America.There are, however, scarcely any illustrations to be relied on of these
instruments transmitted to us.The Conch was frequently used as a
trumpet for conveying signals in war.[Illustration]

The engraving represents a kind of trumpet made of wood, and nearly
seven feet in length, which Gumilla found among the Indians in the
vicinity of the Orinoco.It somewhat resembles the _juruparis_, a
mysterious instrument of the Indians on the Rio Haupés, a tributary
of the Rio <DW64>, south America.The _juruparis_ is regarded as an
object of great veneration.So
stringent is this law that any woman obtaining a sight of it is put to
death--usually by poison.No youths are allowed to see it until they
have been subjected to a series of initiatory fastings and scourgings.The _juruparis_ is usually kept hidden in the bed of some stream, deep
in the forest; and no one dares to drink out of that sanctified stream,
or to bathe in its water.At feasts the _juruparis_ is brought out
during the night, and is blown outside the houses of entertainment.The inner portion of the instrument consists of a tube made of slips
of the Paxiaba palm (_Triartea exorrhiza_).When the Indians are about
to use the instrument they nearly close the upper end of the tube
with clay, and also tie above the oblong square hole (shown in the
engraving) a portion of the leaf of the Uaruma, one of the arrow-root
family.Round the tube are wrapped long strips of the tough bark of the
Jébaru (_Parivoa grandiflora_).This covering descends in folds below
the tube.The length of the instrument is from four to five feet.The
illustration, which exhibits the _juruparis_ with its cover and without
it, has been taken from a specimen in the museum at Kew gardens.The
mysteries connected with this trumpet are evidently founded on an old
tradition from prehistoric Indian ancestors._Jurupari_ means “demon”;
and with several Indian tribes on the Amazon customs and ceremonies
still prevail in honour of Jurupari.The Caroados, an Indian tribe in Brazil, have a war trumpet which
closely resembles the _juruparis_.With this people it is the custom
for the chief to give on his war trumpet the signal for battle, and to
continue blowing as long as he wishes the battle to last.The trumpet
is made of wood, and its sound is described by travellers as very deep
but rather pleasant.The sound is easily produced, and its continuance
does not require much exertion; but a peculiar vibration of the lips
is necessary which requires practice.Another trumpet, the _turé_, is
common with many Indian tribes on the Amazon who use it chiefly in war.It is made of a long and thick bamboo, and there is a split reed in the
mouthpiece.It therefore partakes rather of the character of an oboe
or clarinet.The _turé_ is
especially used by the sentinels of predatory hordes, who, mounted on a
lofty tree, give the signal of attack to their comrades.Again, the aborigines in Mexico had a curious contrivance of this kind,
the _acocotl_, now more usually called _clarin_.The former word is
its old Indian name, and the latter appears to have been first given
to the instrument by the Spaniards.The _acocotl_ consists of a very
thin tube from eight to ten feet in length, and generally not quite
straight but with some irregular curves.This tube, which is often not
thicker than a couple of inches in diameter, terminates at one end in
a sort of bell, and has at the other end a small mouthpiece resembling
in shape that of a clarinet.The tube is made of the dry stalk of a
plant which is common in Mexico, and which likewise the Indians call
_acocotl_.The most singular characteristic of the instrument is that
the performer does not blow into it, but inhales the air through it; or
rather, he produces the sound by sucking the mouthpiece.It is said to
require strong lungs to perform on the _acocotl_ effectively according
to Indian notions of taste.[Illustration]

The _botuto_, which Gumilla saw used by some tribes near the river
Orinoco (of which we engrave two examples), was evidently an ancient
Indian contrivance, but appears to have fallen almost into oblivion
during the last two centuries.It was made of baked clay and was
commonly from three to four feet long: but some trumpets of this kind
were of enormous size.The _botuto_ with two bellies was usually made
thicker than that with three bellies and emitted a deeper sound, which
is described as having been really terrific.These trumpets were used
on occasions of mourning and funeral dances.Alexander von Humboldt saw
the _botuto_ among some Indian tribes near the river Orinoco.Besides those which have been noticed, other antique wind instruments
of the Indians are mentioned by historians; but the descriptions given
of them are too superficial to convey a distinct notion as to their
form and purport.Several of these barbarous contrivances scarcely
deserve to be classed with musical instruments.This may, for instance,
be said of certain musical jars or earthen vessels producing sounds,
which the Peruvians constructed for their amusement.These vessels
were made double; and the sounds imitated the cries of animals or
birds.A similar contrivance of the Indians in Chili, preserved in
the museum at Santiago, is described by the traveller S. S. Hill as
follows:--“It consists of two earthen vessels in the form of our
india-rubber bottles, but somewhat larger, with a flat tube from four
to six inches in length, uniting their necks near the top and slightly
curved upwards, and with a small hole on the upper side one third of
the length of the tube from one side of the necks.To produce the
sounds the bottles were filled with water and suspended to the bough
of a tree, or to a beam, by a string attached to the middle of the
curved tube, and then swung backwards and forwards in such a manner as
to cause each end to be alternately the highest and lowest, so that
the water might pass backwards and forwards from one bottle to the
other through the tube between them.By this means soothing sounds were
produced which, it is said, were employed to lull to repose the drowsy
chiefs who usually slept away the hottest hours of the day.In the
meantime, as the bottles were porous, the water within them diminished
by evaporation, and the sound died gradually away.”

[Illustration]

As regards instruments of percussion, a kind of drum deserves special
notice on account of the ingenuity evinced in its construction.The
Mexicans called it _teponaztli_.They generally made it of a single
block of very hard wood, somewhat oblong square in shape, which they
hollowed, leaving at each end a solid piece about three or four inches
in thickness, and at its upper side a kind of sound-board about a
quarter of an inch in thickness.In this sound-board, if it may be
called so, they made three incisions; namely, two running parallel some
distance lengthwise of the drum, and a third running across from one
of these to the other just in the centre.By this means they obtained
two vibrating tongues of wood which, when beaten with a stick, produced
sounds as clearly defined as are those of our kettle drums.By making
one of the tongues thinner than the other they ensured two different
sounds, the pitch of which they were enabled to regulate by shaving
off more or less of the wood.The bottom of the drum they cut almost
entirely open.The traveller, M. Nebel, was told by archæologists in
Mexico that these instruments always contained the interval of a third,
but on examining several specimens which he saw in museums he found
some in which the two sounds stood towards each other in the relation
of a fourth; while in others they constituted a fifth, in others a
sixth, and in some even an octave.This is noteworthy in so far as it
points to a conformity with our diatonic series of intervals, excepting
the seventh.The _teponaztli_ (engraved above) was generally carved with various
fanciful and ingenious designs.It was beaten with two drumsticks
covered at the end with an elastic gum, called _ule_, which was
obtained from the milky juice extracted from the ule-tree.Some of
these drums were small enough to be carried on a string or strap
suspended round the neck of the player; others, again, measured
upwards of five feet in length, and their sound was so powerful that
it could be heard at a distance of three miles.In some rare instances
a specimen of the _teponaztli_ is still preserved by the Indians in
Mexico, especially among tribes who have been comparatively but little
affected by intercourse with their European aggressors.Herr Heller saw
such an instrument in the hands of the Indians of Huatusco--a village
near Mirador in the Tierra templada, or temperate region, occupying
the <DW72>s of the Cordilleras.Its sound is described as so very loud
as to be distinctly audible at an incredibly great distance.This
circumstance, which has been noticed by several travellers, may perhaps
be owing in some measure to the condition of the atmosphere in Mexico.[Illustration]

Instruments of percussion constructed on a principle more or less
similar to the _teponaztli_ were in use in several other parts of
America, as well as in Mexico.Oviedo gives a drawing of a drum from
San Domingo which, as it shows distinctly both the upper and under
side of the instrument, is here inserted.The largest kind of Mexican _teponaztli_ appears to have been
generally of a cylindrical shape.Clavigero gives a drawing of
such an instrument.Drums, also, constructed of skin or parchment
in combination with wood were not unknown to the Indians.Of this
description was, for instance, the _huehuetl_ of the Aztecs in Mexico,
which consisted, according to Clavigero, of a wooden cylinder somewhat
above three feet in height, curiously carved and painted and covered
at the top with carefully prepared deer-skin.And, what appears the
most remarkable, the parchment (we are told) could be tightened or
slackened by means of cords in nearly the same way as with our own
drum.The _huehuetl_ was not beaten with drumsticks but merely struck
with the fingers, and much dexterity was required to strike it in the
proper manner.Oviedo states that the Indians in Cuba had drums which
were stretched with human skin.And Bernal Diaz relates that when he
was with Cortés in Mexico they ascended together the _Teocalli_ (“House
of God”), a large temple in which human sacrifices were offered by
the aborigines; and there the Spanish visitors saw a large drum which
was made, Diaz tells us, with skins of great serpents.This “hellish
instrument,” as he calls it, produced, when struck, a doleful sound
which was so loud that it could be heard at a distance of two leagues.The name of the Peruvian drum was _huanca_: they had also an instrument
of percussion, called _chhilchiles_, which appears to have been a sort
of tambourine.The rattle was likewise popular with the Indians before the discovery
of America.The Mexicans called it _ajacaxtli_.In construction it was
similar to the rattle at the present day commonly used by the Indians.It was oval or round in shape, and appears to have been usually made
of a gourd into which holes were pierced, and to which a wooden handle
was affixed.A number of little pebbles were enclosed in the hollowed
gourd.The little balls in the
_ajacaxtli_ of pottery, enclosed as they are, may at a first glance
appear a puzzle.Probably, when the rattle was being formed they were
attached to the inside as slightly as possible; and after the clay had
been baked they were detached by means of an implement passed through
the holes.[Illustration]

The Tezcucans (or Acolhuans) belonged to the same race as the Aztecs,
whom they greatly surpassed in knowledge and social refinement.Nezahualcoyotl, a wise monarch of the Tezcucans, abhorred human
sacrifices, and erected a large temple which he dedicated to “The
unknown god, the cause of causes.” This edifice had a tower nine
stories high, on the top of which were placed a number of musical
instruments of various kinds which were used to summon the worshippers
to prayer.Respecting these instruments especial mention is made
of a sonorous metal which was struck with a mallet.This is stated
in a historical essay written by Ixtlilxochitl, a native of Mexico
and of royal descent, who lived in the beginning of the seventeenth
century, and who may be supposed to have been familiar with the musical
practices of his countrymen.But whether the sonorous metal alluded to
was a gong or a bell is not clear from the vague record transmitted to
us.That the bell was known to the Peruvians appears to be no longer
doubtful, since a small copper specimen has been found in one of the
old Peruvian tombs.This interesting relic is now deposited in the
museum at Lima.M. de Castelnau has published a drawing of it, which
is here reproduced.The Peruvians called their bells _chanrares_; it
remains questionable whether this name did not designate rather the
so-called horse bells, which were certainly known to the Mexicans
who called them _yotl_.It is noteworthy that these _yotl_ are found
figured in the picture-writings representing the various objects which
the Aztecs used to pay as tribute to their sovereigns.The collection
of Mexican antiquities in the British museum contains a cluster of
yotl-bells.Being nearly round, they closely resemble the _Schellen_
which the Germans are in the habit of affixing to their horses,
particularly in the winter when they are driving their noiseless
sledges.[Illustration]

Again, in south America sonorous stones are not unknown, and were used
in olden time for musical purposes.The traveller G. T. Vigne saw
among the Indian antiquities preserved in the town of Cuzco, in Peru,
“a musical instrument of green sonorous stone, about a foot long, and
an inch and a half wide, flat-sided, pointed at both ends, and arched
at the back, where it was about a quarter of an inch thick, whence it
diminished to an edge, like the blade of a knife.... In the middle of
the back was a small hole, through which a piece of string was passed;
and when suspended and struck by any hard substance a singularly
musical note was produced.” Humboldt mentions the Amazon-stone, which
on being struck by any hard substance yields a metallic sound.It was
formerly cut by the American Indians into very thin plates, perforated
in the centre and suspended by a string.This kind of stone is not, as might be conjectured from its
name, found exclusively near the Amazon.The name was given to it as
well as to the river by the first European visitors to America, in
allusion to the female warriors respecting whom strange stories are
told.The natives pretending, according to an ancient tradition, that
the stone came from the country of “Women without husbands,” or “Women
living alone.”

As regards the ancient stringed instruments of the American Indians
our information is indeed but scanty.Clavigero says that the Mexicans
were entirely unacquainted with stringed instruments: a statement
the correctness of which is questionable, considering the stage of
civilization to which these people had attained.At any rate, we
generally find one or other kind of such instruments with nations
whose intellectual progress and social condition are decidedly
inferior.The Aztecs had many claims to the character of a civilized
community and (as before said) the Tezcucans were even more advanced
in the cultivation of the arts and sciences than the Aztecs.“The
best histories,” Prescott observes, “the best poems, the best code
of laws, the purest dialect, were all allowed to be Tezcucan.The
Aztecs rivalled their neighbours in splendour of living, and even
in the magnificence of their structures.They displayed a pomp and
ostentatious pageantry, truly Asiatic.” Unfortunately historians
are sometimes not sufficiently discerning in their communications
respecting musical questions.J. Ranking, in describing the grandeur
of the establishment maintained by Montezuma, says that during the
repasts of this monarch “there was music of fiddle, flute, snail-shell,
a kettle-drum, and other strange instruments.” But as this writer does
not indicate the source whence he drew his information respecting
Montezuma’s orchestra including the fiddle, the assertion deserves
scarcely a passing notice.The Peruvians possessed a stringed instrument, called _tinya_, which
was provided with five or seven strings.To conjecture from the
unsatisfactory account of it transmitted to us, the _tinya_ appears to
have been a kind of guitar.Considering the fragility of the materials
of which such instruments are generally constructed, it is perhaps
not surprising that we do not meet with any specimens of them in the
museums of American antiquities.A few remarks will not be out of place here referring to the musical
performances of the ancient Indians; since an acquaintance with the
nature of the performances is likely to afford additional assistance
in appreciating the characteristics of the instruments.In Peru, where
the military system was carefully organised, each division of the army
had its trumpeters, called _cqueppacamayo_, and its drummers, called
_huancarcamayo_.When the Inca returned with his troops victorious from
battle his first act was to repair to the temple of the Sun in order
to offer up thanksgiving; and after the conclusion of this ceremony
the people celebrated the event with festivities, of which music and
dancing constituted a principal part.Musical performances appear to
have been considered indispensable on occasions of public celebrations;
and frequent mention is made of them by historians who have described
the festivals annually observed by the Peruvians.About the month of October the Peruvians celebrated a solemn feast in
honour of the dead, at which ceremony they executed lugubrious songs
and plaintive instrumental music.Compositions of a similar character
were performed on occasion of the decease of a monarch.As soon as it
was made known to the people that their Inca had been “called home to
the mansions of his father the sun” they prepared to celebrate his
obsequies with becoming solemnity.Prescott, in his graphic description
of these observances, says: “At stated intervals, for a year, the
people assembled to renew the expressions of their sorrow; processions
were made displaying the banner of the departed monarch; bards and
minstrels were appointed to chronicle his achievements, and their songs
continued to be rehearsed at high festivals in the presence of the
reigning monarch,--thus stimulating the living by the glorious example
of the dead.” The Peruvians had also particular agricultural songs,
which they were in the habit of singing while engaged in tilling the
lands of the Inca; a duty which devolved upon the whole nation.The
subject of these songs, or rather hymns, referred especially to the
noble deeds and glorious achievements of the Inca and his dynasty.While thus singing, the labourers regulated their work to the rhythm
of the music, thereby ensuring a pleasant excitement and a stimulant in
their occupation, like soldiers regulating their steps to the music of
the military band.These hymns pleased the Spanish invaders so greatly
that they not only adopted several of them but also composed some in a
similar form and style.This appears, however, to have been the case
rather with the poetry than with the music.The name of the Peruvian elegiac songs was _haravi_.Some tunes of
these songs, pronounced to be genuine specimens, have been published
in recent works; but their genuineness is questionable.At all events
they must have been much tampered with, as they exhibit exactly the
form of the Spanish _bolero_.Even allowing that the melodies of
these compositions have been derived from Peruvian _harivaris_, it is
impossible to determine with any degree of certainty how much in them
has been retained of the original tunes, and how much has been supplied
besides the harmony, which is entirely an addition of the European
arranger.The Peruvians had minstrels, called _haravecs_ (_i.e._,
“inventors”), whose occupation it was to compose and to recite the
_haravis_.The Mexicans possessed a class of songs which served as a record
of historical events.Furthermore they had war-songs, love-songs,
and other secular vocal compositions, as well as sacred chants, in
the practice of which boys were instructed by the priests in order
that they might assist in the musical performances of the temple.It appertained to the office of the priests to burn incense, and
to perform music in the temple at stated times of the day.The
commencement of the religious observances which took place regularly
at sunrise, at mid-day, at sunset, and at midnight, was announced by
signals blown on trumpets and pipes.Persons of high position retained
in their service professional musicians whose duty it was to compose
ballads, and to perform vocal music with instrumental accompaniment.The nobles themselves, and occasionally even the monarch, not
unfrequently delighted in composing ballads and odes.Especially to be noticed is the institution termed “Council of music,”
which the wise monarch Nezahualcoyotl founded in Tezcuco.This
institution was not intended exclusively for promoting the cultivation
of music; its aim comprised the advancement of various arts, and of
sciences such as history, astronomy, &c. In fact, it was an academy
for general education.Probably no better evidence could be cited
testifying to the remarkable intellectual attainments of the Mexican
Indians before the discovery of America than this council of music.Although in some respects it appears to have resembled the board of
music of the Chinese, it was planned on a more enlightened and more
comprehensive principle.The Chinese “board of music,” called _Yo
Poo_, is an office connected with the _Lé Poo_ or “board of rites,”
established by the imperial government at Peking.The principal object
of the board of rites is to regulate the ceremonies on occasions
of sacrifices offered to the gods; of festivals and certain court
solemnities; of military reviews; of presentations, congratulations,
marriages, deaths, burials,--in short, concerning almost every possible
event in social and public life.The reader is probably aware that in one of the various hypotheses
which have been advanced respecting the Asiatic origin of the American
Indians China is assigned to them as their ancient home.Some
historians suppose them to be emigrants from Mongolia, Thibet, or
Hindustan; others maintain that they are the offspring of Phœnician
colonists who settled in central America.Even more curious are the
arguments of certain inquirers who have no doubt whatever that the
ancestors of the American Indians were the lost ten tribes of Israel,
of whom since about the time of the Babylonian captivity history is
silent.Whatever may be thought as to which particular one of these
speculations hits the truth, they certainly have all proved useful
in so far as they have made ethnologists more exactly acquainted with
the habits and predilections of the American aborigines than would
otherwise have been the case.For, as the advocates of each hypothesis
have carefully collected and adduced every evidence they were able
to obtain tending to support their views, the result is that (so to
say) no stone has been left unturned.Nevertheless, any such hints as
suggest themselves from an examination of musical instruments have
hitherto remained unheeded.It may therefore perhaps interest the
reader to have his attention drawn to a few suggestive similarities
occurring between instruments of the American Indians and of certain
nations inhabiting the eastern hemisphere.We have seen that the Mexican pipe and the Peruvian syrinx were
purposely constructed so as to produce the intervals of the pentatonic
scale only.There are some additional indications of this scale having
been at one time in use with the American Indians.For instance, the
music of the Peruvian dance _cachua_ is described as having been very
similar to some Scotch national dances; and the most conspicuous
characteristics of the Scotch tunes are occasioned by the frequently
exclusive employment of intervals appertaining to the pentatonic scale.We find precisely the same series of intervals adopted on certain
Chinese instruments, and evidences are not wanting of the pentatonic
scale having been popular among various races in Asia at a remote
period.The series of intervals appertaining to the Chiriqui pipe,
mentioned page 61, consisted of a semitone and two whole tones, like
the _tetrachord_ of the ancient Greeks.In the Peruvian _huayra-puhura_ made of talc some of the pipes possess
lateral holes.This contrivance, which is rather unusual, occurs on the
Chinese _cheng_.The _chayna_, mentioned page 64, seems to have been
provided with a reed, like the oboe: and in Hindustan we find a species
of oboe called _shehna_.The _turé_ of the Indian tribes on the Amazon,
mentioned page 69, reminds us of the trumpets _tooree_, or _tootooree_,
of the Hindus.The name appears to have been known also to the Arabs;
but there is no indication whatever of its having been transmitted to
the peninsula by the Moors, and afterwards to south America by the
Portuguese and Spaniards.The wooden tongues in the drum _teponaztli_ may be considered as a
contrivance exclusively of the ancient American Indians.Nevertheless
a construction nearly akin to it may be observed in certain drums of
the Tonga and Feejee islanders, and of the natives of some islands
in Torres strait.Likewise some <DW64> tribes in western and central
Africa have certain instruments of percussion which are constructed on
a principle somewhat reminding us of the _teponaztli_.The method of
bracing the drum by means of cords, as exhibited in the _huehueil_ of
the Mexican Indians, is evidently of very high antiquity in the east.Rattles, pandean pipes made of reed, and conch trumpets, are found
almost all over the world, wherever the materials of which they are
constructed are easily obtainable.Still, it may be noteworthy that
the Mexicans employed the conch trumpet in their religious observances
apparently in much the same way as it is used in the Buddhist worship
of the Thibetans and Kalmuks.As regards the sonorous metal in the great temple at Tezcuco some
inquirers are sure that it was a gong: but it must be borne in mind
that these inquirers detect everywhere traces proving an invasion of
the Mongols, which they maintain to have happened about six hundred
years ago.Had they been acquainted with the little Peruvian bell
(engraved on page 75) they would have had more tangible musical
evidence in support of their theory than the supposed gong; for this
bell certainly bears a suggestive resemblance to the little hand-bell
which the Buddhists use in their religious ceremonies.The Peruvians interpolated certain songs, especially those which they
were in the habit of singing while cultivating the fields, with the
word _hailli_ which signified “Triumph.” As the subject of these
compositions was principally the glorification of the Inca, the burden
_hailli_ is perhaps all the more likely to remind Europeans of the
Hebrew _hallelujah_.Moreover, Adair, who lived among the Indians of
north America during a period of about forty years, speaks of some
other words which he found used as burdens in hymns sung on solemn
occasions, and which appeared to him to correspond with certain Hebrew
words of a sacred import.As regards the musical accomplishments of the Indian tribes at the
present day they are far below the standard which we have found among
their ancestors.A period of three hundred years of oppression has
evidently had the effect of subduing the melodious expressions of
happiness and contentedness which in former times appear to have
been quite as prevalent with the Indians as they generally are with
independent and flourishing nations.The innate talent for music
evinced by those of the North American Indians who were converted to
Christianity soon after the emigration of the puritans to New England
is very favourably commented on by some old writers.In the year 1661
John Elliot published a translation of the psalms into Indian verse.The singing of these metrical psalms by the Indian converts in their
places of worship appears to have been actually superior to the sacred
vocal performances of their Christian brethren from Europe; for we find
it described by several witnesses as “excellent” and “most ravishing.”

In other parts of America the catholic priests from Spain did not
neglect to turn to account the susceptibility of the Indians for
music.Thus, in central America the Dominicans composed as early as in
the middle of the sixteenth century a sacred poem in the Guatemalian
dialect containing a narrative of the most important events recorded
in the Bible.This production they sang to the natives, and to enhance
the effect they accompanied the singing with musical instruments.The
alluring music soon captivated the heart of a powerful cazique, who
was thus induced to adopt the doctrines embodied in the composition,
and to diffuse them among his subjects who likewise delighted in the
performances.In Peru a similar experiment, resorted to by the priests
who accompanied Pizarro’s expedition, proved equally successful.They
dramatized certain scenes in the life of Christ and represented them
with music, which so greatly fascinated the Indians that many of them
readily embraced the new faith.Nor are these entertainments dispensed
with even at the present day by the Indian Christians, especially
in the village churches of the Sierra in Peru; and as several
religious ceremonies have been retained by these people from their
heathen forefathers, it may be conjectured that their sacred musical
performances also retain much of their ancient heathen character.Most of the musical instruments found among the American Indians at
the present day are evidently genuine old Indian contrivances as they
existed long before the discovery of America.Take, for example, the
peculiarly shaped rattles, drums, flutes, and whistles of the North
American Indians, of which some specimens in the Kensington museum are
described in the large catalogue.A few African instruments, introduced
by the <DW64> slaves, are now occasionally found in the hands of the
Indians, and have been by some travellers erroneously described as
genuine Indian inventions.This is the case with the African _marimba_,
which has become rather popular with the natives of Guatemala in
central America: but such adaptations are very easily discernible.EUROPEAN NATIONS DURING THE MIDDLE AGES.Many representations of musical instruments of the middle ages have
been preserved in manuscripts, as well as in sculptures and paintings
forming ornamental portions of churches and other buildings.Valuable
facts and hints are obtainable from these evidences, provided they
are judiciously selected and carefully examined.The subject is,
however, so large that only a few observations on the most interesting
instruments can be offered here.Unfortunately there still prevails
much uncertainty respecting several of the earliest representations
as to the precise century from which they date, and there is reason
to believe that in some instances the archæological zeal of musical
investigators has assigned a higher antiquity to such discoveries than
can be satisfactorily proved.It appears certain that the most ancient European instruments known to
us were in form and construction more like the Asiatic than was the
case with later ones.Before a nation has attained to a rather high
degree of civilisation its progress in the cultivation of music, as an
art, is very slow indeed.The instruments found at the present day in
Asia are scarcely superior to those which were in use among oriental
nations about three thousand years ago.It is, therefore, perhaps
not surprising that no material improvement is perceptible in the
construction of the instruments of European countries during the lapse
of nearly a thousand years.True, evidences to be relied on referring
to the first five or six centuries of the Christian era are but scanty;
although indications are not wanting which may help the reflecting
musician.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

There are some early monuments of Christian art dating from the fourth
century in which the lyre is represented.In one of them Christ is
depicted as Apollo touching the lyre.This instrument occurs at an
early period in western Europe as used in popular pastimes.In an
Anglo-saxon manuscript of the ninth century in the British museum
(Cleopatra C.are the figures of two gleemen, one playing the
lyre and the other a double-pipe.M. de Coussemaker has published in
the “Annales Archéologiques” the figure of a crowned personage playing
the lyre, which he found in a manuscript of the ninth or tenth century
in the library at Angers.The player twangs the strings with his
fingers, while the Anglo-saxon gleeman before mentioned uses a plectrum._Cithara_ was a name applied to several stringed instruments greatly
varying in form, power of sound, and compass.The illustration
represents a cithara from a manuscript of the ninth century, formerly
in the library of the great monastery of St.When in the year 1768 the monastery was destroyed by fire, this
valuable book perished in the flames; fortunately the celebrated abbot
Gerbert possessed tracings of the illustrations, which were saved from
destruction.He published them, in the year 1774, in his work “De cantu
et musica sacra.” Several illustrations in the following pages, it
will be seen, have been derived from this interesting source.As the
older works on music were generally written in Latin we do not learn
from them the popular names of the instruments; the writers merely
adopted such Latin names as they thought the most appropriate.Thus,
for instance, a very simple stringed instrument of a triangular shape,
and a somewhat similar one of a square shape were designated by the
name of _psalterium_; and we further give a woodcut of the square kind
(p.86), and of a _cithara_ (above) from the same manuscript.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

This last instrument is evidently an improvement upon the triangular
psalterium, because it has a sort of small sound-board at the top.Scarcely better, with regard to acoustics, appears to have been the
instrument designated as _nablum_, which we engrave (p.87) from a
manuscript of the ninth century at Angers.[Illustration]

A small psalterium with strings placed over a sound-board was
apparently the prototype of the _citole_; a kind of dulcimer which was
played with the fingers.The names were not only often vaguely applied
by the mediæval writers but they changed also in almost every century.The psalterium, or psalterion (Italian _salterio_, English _psaltery_),
of the fourteenth century and later had the trapezium shape of the
dulcimer.[Illustration]

The Anglo-saxons frequently accompanied their vocal effusions with a
harp, more or less triangular in shape,--an instrument which may be
considered rather as constituting the transition of the lyre into the
harp.The representation of king David playing the harp is from an
Anglo-saxon manuscript of the beginning of the eleventh century, in
the British museum.The harp was especially popular in central and
northern Europe, and was the favourite instrument of the German and
Celtic bards and of the Scandinavian skalds.In the next illustration
from the manuscript of the monastery of St.Blasius twelve strings
and two sound holes are given to it.A harp similar in form and size,
but without the front pillar, was known to the ancient Egyptians.Perhaps the addition was also non-existent in the earliest specimens
appertaining to European nations; and a sculptured figure of a small
harp constructed like the ancient eastern harp has been discovered in
the old church of Ullard in the county of Kilkenny.Of this curious
relic, which is said to date from a period anterior to the year 800, a
fac-simile taken from Bunting’s “Ancient Music of Ireland” is given (p.As Bunting was the first who drew attention to this sculpture his
account of it may interest the reader.“The drawing” he says “is taken
from one of the ornamental compartments of a sculptured cross, at the
old church of Ullard.From the style of the workmanship, as well as
from the worn condition of the cross, it seems older than the similar
monument at Monasterboice which is known to have been set up before the
year 830.The sculpture is rude; the circular rim which binds the arms
of the cross together is not pierced in the quadrants, and many of the
figures originally in relievo are now wholly abraded.It is difficult
to determine whether the number of strings represented is six or seven;
but, as has been already remarked, accuracy in this respect cannot be
expected either in sculptures or in many picturesque drawings.” The
Finns had a harp (_harpu_, _kantele_) with a similar frame, devoid of
a front pillar, still in use until the commencement of the present
century.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

One of the most interesting stringed instruments of the middle ages
is the _rotta_ (German, _rotte_; English, _rote_).It was sounded by
twanging the strings, and also by the application of the bow.The first
method was, of course, the elder one.There can hardly be a doubt
that when the bow came into use it was applied to certain popular
instruments which previously had been treated like the _cithara_ or
the _psalterium_.The Hindus at the present day use their _suroda_
sometimes as a lute and sometimes as a fiddle.In some measure we
do the same with the violin by playing occasionally _pizzicato_.The
_rotta_ (shown p.Blasius is called in
Gerbert’s work _cithara teutonica_, while the harp is called _cithara
anglica_; from which it would appear that the former was regarded as
pre-eminently a German instrument.Possibly its name may have been
originally _chrotta_ and the continental nations may have adopted it
from the Celtic races of the British isles, dropping the guttural
sound.This hypothesis is, however, one of those which have been
advanced by some musical historians without any satisfactory evidence.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

We engrave also another representation of David playing on the
_rotta_, from a psalter of the seventh century in the British museum
(Cott.According to tradition, this psalter is one of
the manuscripts which were sent by pope Gregory to St.The instrument much resembles the lyre in the hand of the musician
(see p.22) who is supposed to be a Hebrew of the time of Joseph.In
the _rotta_ the ancient Asiatic lyre is easily to be recognized.An
illumination of king David playing the _rotta_ forms the frontispiece
of a manuscript of the eighth century preserved in the cathedral
library of Durham; and which is musically interesting inasmuch as
it represents a _rotta_ of an oblong square shape like that just
noticed and resembling the Welsh _crwth_.It has only five strings
which the performer twangs with his fingers.Again, a very interesting
representation (which we engrave) of the Psalmist with a kind of
_rotta_ occurs in a manuscript of the tenth century, in the British
museum (Vitellius F.The manuscript has been much injured by
a fire in the year 1731, but Professor Westwood has succeeded, with
great care, and with the aid of a magnifying glass, in making out
the lines of the figure.As it has been ascertained that the psalter
is written in the Irish semi-uncial character it is highly probable
that the kind of _rotta_ represents the Irish _cionar cruit_, which
was played by twanging the strings and also by the application of a
bow.Unfortunately we possess no well-authenticated representation
of the Welsh _crwth_ of an early period; otherwise we should in all
probability find it played with the fingers, or with a plectrum.Venantius Fortunatus, an Italian who lived in the second half of the
sixth century, mentions in a poem the “Chrotta Britanna.” He does
not, however, allude to the bow, and there is no reason to suppose
that it existed in England.Howbeit, the Welsh _crwth_ (Anglo-saxon,
_crudh_; English, _crowd_) is only known as a species of fiddle closely
resembling the _rotta_, but having a finger-board in the middle of the
open frame and being strung with only a few strings; while the _rotta_
had sometimes above twenty strings.As it may interest the reader to
examine the form of the modern _crwth_ we give a woodcut of it.Edward
Jones, in his “Musical and poetical relicks of the Welsh bards,”
records that the Welsh had before this kind of _crwth_ a three-stringed
one called “Crwth Trithant,” which was, he says, “a sort of violin, or
more properly a rebeck.” The three-stringed _crwth_ was chiefly used by
the inferior class of bards; and was probably the Moorish fiddle which
is still the favourite instrument of the itinerant bards of the Bretons
in France, who call it _rébek_.The Bretons, it will be remembered, are
close kinsmen of the Welsh.[Illustration]

A player on the _crwth_ or _crowd_ (a crowder) from a bas-relief on the
under part of the seats of the choir in Worcester cathedral (engraved
p.95) dates from the twelfth or thirteenth century; and we give (p.96) a copy of an illumination from a manuscript in the Bibliothèque
royale at Paris of the eleventh century.The player wears a crown on
his head; and in the original some musicians placed at his side are
performing on the psalterium and other instruments.These last are
figured with uncovered heads; whence M. de Coussemaker concludes that
the _crout_ was considered by the artist who drew the figures as the
noblest instrument.It was probably identical with the _rotta_ of the
same century on the continent.[Illustration]

An interesting drawing of an Anglo-saxon fiddle--or _fithele_, as it
was called--is given in a manuscript of the eleventh century in the
British museum (Cotton, Tiberius, c.The instrument is of a pear
shape, with four strings, and the bridge is not indicated.A German
fiddle of the ninth century, called _lyra_, copied by Gerbert from the
manuscript of St.These are shown in the
woodcuts (p.Other records of the employment of the fiddle-bow
in Germany in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are not wanting.For instance, in the famous ‘Nibelungenlied’ Volker is described as
wielding the fiddle-bow not less dexterously than the sword.And in
‘Chronicon picturatum Brunswicense’ of the year 1203, the following
miraculous sign is recorded as having occurred in the village of
Ossemer: “On Wednesday in Whitsun-week, while the parson was fiddling
to his peasants who were dancing, there came a flash of lightning
and struck the parson’s arm which held the fiddle-bow, and killed
twenty-four people on the spot.”

[Illustration]

Among the oldest representations of performers on instruments of the
violin kind found in England those deserve to be noticed which are
painted on the interior of the roof of Peterborough cathedral.They
are said to date from the twelfth century.One of these figures is
particularly interesting on account of the surprising resemblance which
his instrument bears to our present violin.Not only the incurvations
on the sides of the body but also the two sound-holes are nearly
identical in shape with those made at the present day.Respecting the
reliance to be placed on such evidence, it is necessary to state that
the roof, originally constructed between the years 1177 and 1194, was
thoroughly repaired in the year 1835.Although we find it asserted that
“the greatest care was taken to retain every part, or to restore it
to its original state, so that the figures, even where retouched, are
in effect the same as when first painted,” it nevertheless remains a
debatable question whether the restorers have not admitted some slight
alterations, and have thereby somewhat modernised the appearance of
the instruments.A slight touch with the brush at the sound-holes, the
screws, or the curvatures, would suffice to produce modifications which
might to the artist appear as being only a renovation of the original
representation, but which to the musical investigator greatly impair
the value of the evidence.Sculptures are, therefore, more to be
relied upon in evidence than frescoes.[Illustration]

CHAPTER VIII.The construction of the _organistrum_ requires but little explanation.A glance at the finger-board reveals at once that the different
tones were obtained by raising the keys placed on the neck under the
strings, and that the keys were raised by means of the handles at
the side of the neck.Of the two bridges shown on the body, the one
situated nearest the middle was formed by a wheel in the inside, which
projected through the sound-board.The wheel which slightly touched
the strings vibrated them by friction when turned by the handle at
the end.The order of intervals was _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, _g_, _a_,
_b-flat_, _b-natural_, _c_, and were obtainable on the highest string.There is reason to suppose that the other two strings were generally
tuned a fifth and an octave below the highest.The _organistrum_ may
be regarded as the predecessor of the hurdy-gurdy, and was a rather
cumbrous contrivance.Two persons seem to have been required to sound
it, one to turn the handle and the other to manage the keys.Thus it is
generally represented in mediæval concerts.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The _monochord_ (p.100) was mounted with a single string stretched
over two bridges which were fixed on an oblong box.The string could be
tightened or slackened by means of a turning screw inserted into one
end of the box.The intervals of the scale were marked on the side, and
were regulated by a sort of movable bridge placed beneath the string
when required.As might be expected, the _monochord_ was chiefly used
by theorists; for any musical performance it was but little suitable.About a thousand years ago when this monochord was in use the musical
scale was diatonic, with the exception of the interval of the seventh,
which was chromatic inasmuch as both _b-flat_ and _b-natural_ formed
part of the scale.The notation on the preceding page exhibits the
compass as well as the order of intervals adhered to about the tenth
century.This ought to be borne in mind in examining the representations of
musical instruments transmitted to us from that period.As regards the wind instruments popular during the middle ages, some
were of quaint form as well as of rude construction.The _chorus_, or _choron_, had either one or two tubes, as in the
woodcut page 101.There were several varieties of this instrument;
sometimes it was constructed with a bladder into which the tube is
inserted; this kind of _chorus_ resembled the bagpipe; another kind
resembled the _poongi_ of the Hindus, mentioned page 51.The name
_chorus_ was also applied to certain stringed instruments.One of
these had much the form of the _cithara_, page 86.It appears however,
probable that _chorus_ or _choron_ originally designated a horn
(Hebrew, _Keren_; Greek, _Keras_; Latin, _cornu_).[Illustration]

The flutes of the middle ages were blown at the end, like the
flageolet.Of the _syrinx_ there are extant some illustrations of the
ninth and tenth centuries, which exhibit the instrument with a number
of tubes tied together, just like the Pandean pipe still in use.In one
specimen engraved (page 102) from a manuscript of the eleventh century
the tubes were inserted into a bowl-shaped box.This is probably the
_frestele_, _fretel_, or _fretiau_, which in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries was in favour with the French ménétriers.Some large Anglo-saxon trumpets may be seen in a manuscript of the
eighth century in the British museum.The largest kind of trumpet was
placed on a stand when blown.Of the _oliphant_, or hunting horn, some
fine specimens are in the South Kensington collection.The _sackbut_
(of which we give a woodcut) probably made of metal, could be drawn
out to alter the pitch of sound.The sackbut of the ninth century had,
however, a very different shape to that in use about three centuries
ago, and much more resembled the present _trombone_.The name _sackbut_
is supposed to be a corruption of _sambuca_.The French, about the
fifteenth century, called it _sacqueboute_ and _saquebutte_.[Illustration]

The most important wind instrument--in fact, the king of all the
musical instruments--is the organ.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The _pneumatic organ_ is sculptured on an obelisk which was erected
in Constantinople under Theodosius the great, towards the end of the
fourth century.The bellows were pressed by men standing on them:
see page 103.This interesting monument also exhibits performers on
the double flute.The _hydraulic organ_, which is recorded to have
been already known about two hundred years before the Christian era,
was according to some statements occasionally employed in churches
during the earlier centuries of the middle ages.Probably it was more
frequently heard in secular entertainments for which it was more
suitable; and at the beginning of the fourteenth century appears to
have been entirely supplanted by the pneumatic organ.The earliest
organs had only about a dozen pipes.The largest, which were made
about nine hundred years ago, had only three octaves, in which the
chromatic intervals did not occur.Some progress in the construction
of the organ is exhibited in an illustration (engraved p.104) dating
from the twelfth century, in a psalter of Eadwine, in the library of
Trinity college, Cambridge.The instrument has ten pipes, or perhaps
fourteen, as four of them appear to be double pipes.It required four
men exerting all their power to produce the necessary wind, and two men
to play the instrument.Moreover, both players seem also to be busily
engaged in directing the blowers about the proper supply of wind.It must be admitted that since the twelfth
century some progress has been made, at all events, in the construction
of the organ.[Illustration]

The pedal is generally believed to have been invented by Bernhard, a
German, who lived in Venice about the year 1470.There are, however,
indications extant pointing to an earlier date of its invention.Perhaps Bernhard was the first who, by adopting a more practicable
construction, made the pedal more generally known.On the earliest
organs the keys of the finger-board were of enormous size, compared
with those of the present day; so that a finger-board with only nine
keys had a breadth of from four to five feet.The organist struck the
keys down with his fist, as is done in playing the _carillon_ still in
use on the continent, of which presently some account will be given.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

Of the little portable organ, known as the _regal_ or _regals_,
often tastefully shaped and embellished, some interesting sculptured
representations are still extant in the old ecclesiastical edifices
of England and Scotland.There is, for instance, in Beverley minster
a figure of a man playing on a single regal, or a regal provided
with only one set of pipes; and in Melrose abbey the figure of an
angel holding in his arms a double regal, the pipes of which are in
two sets.The regal generally had keys like those of the organ but
smaller.A painting in the national Gallery, by Melozzo da Forli
who lived in the fifteenth century, contains a regal which has keys
of a peculiar shape, rather resembling the pistons of certain brass
instruments.To avoid misapprehension, it is necessary to mention that the name
_regal_ (or _regals_, _rigols_) was also applied to an instrument
of percussion with sonorous slabs of wood.This contrivance was, in
short, a kind of harmonica, resembling in shape as well as in the
principle of its construction the little glass harmonica, a mere toy,
in which slips of glass are arranged according to our musical scale.In England it appears to have been still known in the beginning of the
eighteenth century.Grassineau describes the “Rigols” as “a kind of
musical instrument consisting of several sticks bound together, only
separated by beads.It makes a tolerable harmony, being well struck
with a ball at the end of a stick.” In the earlier centuries of the
middle ages there appear to have been some instruments of percussion in
favour, to which Grassineau’s expression “a tolerable harmony” would
scarcely have been applicable.Drums, of course, were known; and their
rhythmical noise must have been soft music, compared with the shrill
sounds of the _cymbalum_; a contrivance consisting of a number of metal
plates suspended on cords, so that they could be clashed together
simultaneously; or with the clangour of the _cymbalum_ constructed
with bells instead of plates; or with the piercing noise of the
_bunibulum_, or _bombulom_; an instrument which consisted of an angular
frame to which were loosely attached metal plates of various shapes
and sizes.The lower part of the frame constituted the handle: and to
produce the noise it evidently was shaken somewhat like the sistrum of
the ancient Egyptians.[Illustration]

The _triangle_ nearly resembled the instrument of this name in use
at the present day; it was more elegant in shape and had some metal
ornamentation in the middle.The _tintinnabulum_ consisted of a number of bells arranged in regular
order and suspended in a frame.[Illustration]




CHAPTER IX.Respecting the orchestras, or musical bands, represented on monuments
of the middle ages, there can hardly be a doubt that the artists who
sculptured them were not unfrequently led by their imagination rather
than by an adherence to actual fact.It is, however, not likely that
they introduced into such representations instruments that were never
admitted in the orchestras, and which would have appeared inappropriate
to the contemporaries of the artists.An examination of one or two
of the orchestras may therefore find a place here, especially as
they throw some additional light upon the characteristics of the
instrumental music of mediæval time.A very interesting group of music performers dating, it is said, from
the end of the eleventh century is preserved in a bas-relief which
formerly ornamented the abbey of St.Georges de Boscherville and which
is now removed to the museum of Rouen.The orchestra comprises twelve
performers, most of whom wear a crown.The first of them plays upon
a viol, which he holds between his knees as the violoncello is held.His instrument is scarcely as large as the smallest viola da gamba.By
his side are a royal lady and her attendant, the former playing on an
_organistrum_ of which the latter is turning the wheel.Next to these
is represented a performer on a _syrinx_ of the kind shown in the
engraving p.112; and next to him a performer on a stringed instrument
resembling a lute, which, however, is too much dilapidated to be
recognisable.Then we have a musician with a small stringed instrument
resembling the _nablum_, p.The next musician, also represented as
a royal personage, plays on a small species of harp.Then follows a
crowned musician playing the viol which he holds in almost precisely
the same manner as the violin is held.Again, another, likewise
crowned, plays upon a harp, using with the right hand a plectrum
and with the left hand merely his fingers.The last two performers,
apparently a gentleman and a gentlewoman, are engaged in striking the
_tintinnabulum_,--a set of bells in a frame.[Illustration]

In this group of crowned minstrels the sculptor has introduced a
tumbler standing on his head, perhaps the vocalist of the company, as
he has no instrument to play upon.Possibly the sculptor desired to
symbolise the hilarious effects which music is capable of producing, as
well as its elevating influence upon the devotional feelings.[Illustration]

The two positions in which we find the viol held is worthy of notice,
inasmuch as it refers the inquirer further back than might be expected
for the origin of our peculiar method of holding the violin, and the
violoncello, in playing.There were several kinds of the viol in use
differing in size and in compass of sound.The most common number of
strings was five, and it was tuned in various ways.One kind had a
string tuned to the note [Illustration] running at the side of the
finger-board instead of over it; this string was, therefore, only
capable of producing a single tone.The four other strings were tuned
thus: [Illustration] Two other species, on which all the strings
were placed over the finger-board, were tuned: [Illustration] and:
[Illustration] The woodcut above represents a very beautiful _vielle_;
French, of about 1550, with monograms of Henry II.The contrivance of placing a string or two at the side of the
finger-board is evidently very old, and was also gradually adopted on
other instruments of the violin class of a somewhat later period than
that of the _vielle_; for instance, on the _lira di braccio_ of the
Italians.It was likewise adopted on the lute, to obtain a fuller power
in the bass; and hence arose the _theorbo_, the _archlute_, and other
varieties of the old lute.[Illustration:

  A. REID.ORCHESTRA, TWELFTH CENTURY, AT SANTIAGO.]A grand assemblage of musical performers is represented on the
Portico della gloria of the famous pilgrimage church of Santiago da
Compostella, in Spain.This triple portal, which is stated by an
inscription on the lintel to have been executed in the year 1188,
consists of a large semicircular arch with a smaller arch on either
side.The central arch is filled by a tympanum, round which are
twenty-four life-sized seated figures, in high relief, representing the
twenty-four elders seen by St.John in the Apocalypse, each with an
instrument of music.These instruments are carefully represented and
are of great interest as showing those in use in Spain at about the
twelfth century.A cast of this sculpture is in the Kensington museum.In examining the group of musicians on this sculpture the reader will
probably recognise several instruments in their hands, which are
identical with those already described in the preceding pages.The
_organistrum_, played by two persons, is placed in the centre of the
group, perhaps owing to its being the largest of the instruments rather
than that it was distinguished by any superiority in sound or musical
effect.Besides the small harp seen in the hands of the eighth and
nineteenth musicians (in form nearly identical with the Anglo-saxon
harp) we find a small triangular harp, without a front-pillar, held on
the lap by the fifth and eighteenth musicians.The _salterio_ on the
lap of the tenth and seventeenth musicians resembles the dulcimer, but
seems to be played with the fingers instead of with hammers.The most
interesting instrument in this orchestra is the _vihuela_, or Spanish
viol, of the twelfth century.The first, second, third, sixth, seventh,
ninth, twentieth, twenty-second, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth
musicians are depicted with a _vihuela_ which bears a close resemblance
to the _rebec_.The instrument is represented with three strings,
although in one or two instances five tuning-pegs are indicated.A
large species of _vihuela_ is given to the eleventh, fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth musicians.This instrument differs from the
_rebec_ in as far as its body is broader and has incurvations at the
sides.Also the sound-holes are different in form and position.The bow
does not occur with any of these viols.But, as will be observed, the
musicians are not represented in the act of playing; they are tuning
and preparing for the performance, and the second of them is adjusting
the bridge of his instrument.[Illustration: FRONT OF THE MINSTRELS’ GALLERY, EXETER CATHEDRAL.The minstrels’ gallery of Exeter cathedral dates from the fourteenth
century.The front is divided into twelve niches, each of which
contains a winged figure or an angel playing on an instrument of music.There is a cast also of this famous sculpture at South Kensington.The
instruments are so much dilapidated that some of them cannot be clearly
recognized; but, as far as may be ascertained, they appear to be as
follows:--1.The _clarion_, a small
trumpet having a shrill sound.The _gittern_, a
small guitar strung with catgut.The _timbrel_;
resembling our present tambourine, with a double row of gingles._Cymbals._ Most of these instruments have been already noticed in the
preceding pages.The _shalm_, or _shawm_, was a pipe with a reed in
the mouth-hole.The _wait_ was an English wind instrument of the same
construction.If it differed in any respect from the _shalm_, the
difference consisted probably in the size only.The _wait_ obtained its
name from being used principally by watchmen, or _waights_, to proclaim
the time of night.Such were the poor ancestors of our fine oboe and
clarinet.CHAPTER X.


POST-MEDIÆVAL MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.Attention must now be drawn to some instruments which originated during
the middle ages, but which attained their highest popularity at a
somewhat later period.[Illustration]

Among the best known of these was the _virginal_, of which we give an
engraving from a specimen of the time of Elizabeth at South Kensington.Another was the _lute_, which about three hundred years ago was almost
as popular as is at the present day the pianoforte.Originally it had
eight thin catgut strings arranged in four pairs, each pair being tuned
in unison; so that its open strings produced four tones; but in the
course of time more strings were added.Until the sixteenth century
twelve was the largest number or, rather, six pairs.Eleven appear
for some centuries to have been the most usual number of strings:
these produced six tones, since they were arranged in five pairs and a
single string.The latter, called the _chanterelle_, was the highest.According to Thomas Mace, the English lute in common use during the
seventeenth century had twenty-four strings, arranged in twelve pairs,
of which six pairs ran over the finger-board and the other six by
the side of it.This lute was therefore, more properly speaking, a
theorbo.The neck of the lute, and also of the theorbo, had frets
consisting of catgut strings tightly fastened round it at the proper
distances required for ensuring a chromatic succession of intervals.The illustration on the next page represents a lute-player of the
sixteenth century.The frets are not indicated in the old engraving
from which the illustration has been taken.The order of tones adopted
for the open strings varied in different centuries and countries:
and this was also the case with the notation of lute music.The most
common practice was to write the music on six lines, the upper line
representing the first string; the second line, the second string, &c.,
and to mark with letters on the lines the frets at which the fingers
ought to be placed--_a_ indicating the open string, _b_ the first fret,
_c_ the second fret, and so on.The lute was made of various sizes according to the purpose for
which it was intended in performance.The treble-lute was of the
smallest dimensions, and the bass-lute of the largest.The _theorbo_,
or double-necked lute which appears to have come into use during
the sixteenth century, had in addition to the strings situated over
the finger-board a number of others running at the left side of
the finger-board which could not be shortened by the fingers, and
which produced the bass tones.The largest kinds of theorbo were the
_archlute_ and the _chitarrone_.It is unnecessary to enter here into a detailed description of some
other instruments which have been popular during the last three
centuries, for the museum at Kensington contains specimens of many
of them of which an account is given in the large catalogue of that
collection.It must suffice to refer the reader to the illustrations
there of the cither, virginal, spinet, clavichord, harpsichord, and
other antiquated instruments much esteemed by our forefathers.Students who examine these old relics will probably wish to know
something about their quality of tone.Might
they still be made effective in our present state of the art?” are
questions which naturally occur to the musical inquirer having such
instruments brought before him.A few words bearing on these questions
may therefore not be out of place here.[Illustration]

It is generally and justly admitted that in no other branch of the art
of music has greater progress been made since the last century than
in the construction of musical instruments.Nevertheless, there are
people who think that we have also lost something here which might
with advantage be restored.Our various instruments by being more and
more perfected are becoming too much alike in quality of sound, or in
that character of tone which the French call _timbre_, and the Germans
_Klangfarbe_, and which professor Tyndall in his lectures on sound has
translated _clang-tint_.Every musical composer knows how much more
suitable one _clang-tint_ is for the expression of a certain emotion
than another.Our old instruments, imperfect though they were in many
respects, possessed this variety of _clang-tint_ to a high degree.Neither were they on this account less capable of expression than the
modern ones.That no improvement has been made during the last two
centuries in instruments of the violin class is a well-known fact.As
to lutes and cithers the collection at Kensington contains specimens
so rich and mellow in tone as to cause musicians to regret that these
instruments have entirely fallen into oblivion.As regards beauty of appearance our earlier instruments were certainly
superior to the modern.Indeed, we have now scarcely a musical
instrument which can be called beautiful.The old lutes, spinets,
viols, dulcimers, &c., are not only elegant in shape but are also often
tastefully ornamented with carvings, designs in marquetry, and painting.[Illustration]

The player on the _viola da gamba_, shown in the next engraving, is
a reduced copy of an illustration in “The Division Violist,” London,
1659.It shows exactly how the frets were regulated, and how the bow
was held.The most popular instruments played with a bow, at that time,
were the _treble-viol_, the _tenor-viol_, and the _bass-viol_.It was
usual for viol players to have “a chest of viols,” a case containing
four or more viols, of different sizes.Thus, Thomas Mace in his
directions for the use of the viol, “Musick’s Monument” 1676, remarks,
“Your best provision, and most complete, will be a good chest of viols,
six in number, viz., two basses, two tenors, and two trebles, all truly
and proportionably suited.” The violist, to be properly furnished with
his requirements, had therefore to supply himself with a larger stock
of instruments than the violinist of the present day.[Illustration]

That there was, in the time of Shakespeare, a musical instrument
called _recorder_ is undoubtedly known to most readers from the stage
direction in Hamlet: _Re-enter players with recorders_.But not many
are likely to have ever seen a recorder, as it has now become very
scarce: we therefore give an illustration of this old instrument, which
is copied from “The Genteel Companion; Being exact Directions for the
Recorder: etc.” London, 1683.The _bagpipe_ appears to have been from time immemorial a special
favourite instrument with the Celtic races; but it was perhaps quite as
much admired by the Slavonic nations.In Poland, and in the Ukraine,
it used to be made of the whole skin of the goat in which the shape
of the animal, whenever the bagpipe was expanded with air, appeared
fully retained, exhibiting even the head with the horns; hence the
bagpipe was called _kosa_, which signifies a goat.120
represents a Scotch bagpipe of the last century.The bagpipe is of high antiquity in Ireland, and is alluded to in Irish
poetry and prose said to date from the tenth century.A pig gravely
engaged in playing the bagpipe is represented in an illuminated Irish
manuscript, of the year 1300: and we give p.121 a copy of a woodcut
from “The Image of Ireland,” a book printed in London in 1581.[Illustration]

The _bell_ has always been so much in popular favour in England that
some account of it must not be omitted.Paul Hentzner a German, who
visited England in the year 1598, records in his journal: “The people
are vastly fond of great noises that fill the ear, such as the firing
of cannon, drums, and the ringing of bells; so that in London it is
common for a number of them that have got a glass in their heads to go
up into some belfry, and ring the bells for hours together for the sake
of exercise.” This may be exaggeration,--not unusual with travellers.It is, however, a fact that bell-ringing has been a favourite amusement
with Englishmen for centuries.The way in which church bells are suspended and fastened, so as to
permit of their being made to vibrate in the most effective manner
without damaging by their vibration the building in which they are
placed, is in some countries very peculiar.The Italian _campanile_, or
tower of bells, is not unfrequently separated from the church itself.In Servia the church bells are often hung in a frame-work of timber
built near the west end of the church.In Zante and other islands of
Greece the belfry is usually separate from the church.The reason
assigned by the Greeks for having adopted this plan is that in case
of an earthquake the bells are likely to fall and, were they placed
in a tower, would destroy the roof of the church and might cause the
destruction of the whole building.Also in Russia a special edifice
for the bells is generally separate from the church.In the Russian
villages the bells are not unfrequently hung in the branches of an
oak-tree near the church.In Iceland the bell is usually placed in the
lych-gate leading to the graveyard.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The idea of forming of a number of bells a musical instrument such
as the _carillon_ is said by some to have suggested itself first to
the English and Dutch; but what we have seen in Asiatic countries
sufficiently refutes this.Moreover, not only the Romans employed
variously arranged and attuned bells, but also among the Etruscan
antiquities an instrument has been discovered which is constructed of
a number of bronze vessels placed in a row on a metal rod.Numerous
bells, varying in size and tone, have also been found in Etruscan
tombs.Among the later contrivances of this kind in European countries
the sets of bells suspended in a wooden frame, which we find in
mediæval illuminations, deserve notice.In the British museum is a
manuscript of the fourteenth century in which king David is depicted
holding in each hand a hammer with which he strikes upon bells of
different dimensions, suspended on a wooden stand.It may be supposed that the device of playing tunes by means of bells
merely swung by the hand is also of ancient date.In Lancashire each
of the ringers manages two bells, holding one in either hand.Thus, an
assemblage of seven ringers insures fourteen different tones; and as
each ringer may change his two notes by substituting two other bells if
required, even compositions with various modulations, and of a somewhat
intricate character, may be executed,--provided the ringers are good
timeists; for each has, of course, to take care to fall in with his
note, just as a member of the Russian horn band contributes his single
note whenever it occurs.Peal-ringing is another pastime of the kind which may be regarded as
pre-eminently national to England.The bells constituting a peal are
frequently of the number of eight, attuned to the diatonic scale.Also
peals of ten bells, and even of twelve, are occasionally formed.A
peculiar feature of peal-ringing is that the bells, which are provided
with clappers, are generally swung so forcibly as to raise the mouth
completely upwards.The largest peal, and one of the finest, is at
Exeter cathedral: another celebrated one is that of St.Margaret’s,
Leicester, which consists of ten bells.Peal-ringing is of an early
date in England; Egelric, abbot of Croyland, is recorded to have cast
about the year 960 a set of six bells.The _carillon_ (engraved on the opposite page) is especially popular
in the Netherlands and Belgium, but is also found in Germany, Italy,
and some other European countries.It is generally placed in the church
tower and also sometimes in other public edifices.The statement
repeated by several writers that the first carillon was invented in
the year 1481 in the town of Alost is not to be trusted, for the town
of Bruges claims to have possessed similar chimes in the year 1300.There are two kinds of carillons in use on the continent, viz.: clock
chimes, which are moved by machinery, like a self-acting barrel-organ;
and such as are provided with a set of keys, by means of which the
tunes are played by a musician.The carillon in the ‘Parochial-Kirche’
at Berlin, which is one of the finest in Germany, contains thirty-seven
bells; and is provided with a key-board for the hands and with a pedal,
which together place at the disposal of the performer a compass of
rather more than three octaves.The keys of the manual are metal rods
somewhat above a foot in length; and are pressed down with the palms of
the hand.The keys of the pedal are of wood; the instrument requires
not only great dexterity but also a considerable physical power.It
is astonishing how rapidly passages can be executed upon it by the
player, who is generally the organist of the church in which he acts as
_carilloneur_.When engaged in the last-named capacity he usually wears
leathern gloves to protect his fingers, as they are otherwise apt to
become ill fit for the more delicate treatment of the organ.The want of a contrivance in the _carillon_ for stopping the vibration
has the effect of making rapid passages, if heard near, sound as a
confused noise; only at some distance are they tolerable.It must be
remembered that the _carillon_ is intended especially to be heard from
a distance.Successions of tones which form a consonant chord, and
which have some duration, are evidently the most suitable for this
instrument.Indeed, every musical instrument possesses certain characteristics
which render it especially suitable for the production of some
particular effects.The invention of a new instrument of music has,
therefore, not unfrequently led to the adoption of new effects in
compositions.Take the pianoforte, which was invented in the beginning
of the eighteenth century, and which has now obtained so great a
popularity: its characteristics inspired our great composers to the
invention of effects, or expressions, which cannot be properly rendered
on any other instrument, however superior in some respects it may be to
the pianoforte.Thus also the improvements which have been made during
the present century in the construction of our brass instruments, and
the invention of several new brass instruments, have evidently been
not without influence upon the conceptions displayed in our modern
orchestral works.Imperfect though this essay may be it will probably have convinced
the reader that a reference to the history of the music of different
nations elucidates many facts illustrative of our own musical
instruments, which to the unprepared observer must appear misty and
impenetrable.In truth, it is with this study as with any other
scientific pursuit.The unassisted eye sees only faint nebulæ where
with the aid of the telescope bright stars are revealed.Al-Farabi, a great performer on the lute, 57

Transcriber's note:

Inconsistent punctuation and capitalization are as in the original.Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.Why, I can easily prove that I was
in Paris at the time of the murder."I don't doubt that you have an impeccable alibi.But if I informed the police that you were passing off as your wife a
girl several years younger than Lady Wilmersley, a girl, moreover, who,
you acknowledged, joined you at Newhaven the very morning after the
murder--if I told them that this young lady had in her possession a
remarkable number of jewels, which she carried in a cheap, black
bag--what do you think they would say to that, my lord?"Cyril felt cold chills creeping down his back and the palms of his hands
grew moist.Not a flicker of an eyelash, however, betrayed his inward
tumult."They would no doubt pay as high a tribute to your imagination
as I do," he answered.Then, abandoning his careless pose, he sat up in his chair."You have been insulting me for the last half-hour, and I have borne it
very patiently, partly because your absurd suspicions amused me, and
partly because I realised that, although you are a fool, you are an
honest fool.""You can hardly resent being called a fool by a man you have been
accusing of murder and wife-beating.But I don't want you to go to the
police with this cock-and-bull story----"

"Ah!"Because," continued Cyril, ignoring the interruption, "I want to
protect my wife from unpleasant notoriety, and also, although you don't
deserve it, to keep you from becoming a public laughing stock.So far
you have done all the talking; now you are to listen to me.You make me nervous strutting about like that.Now let us see what all this rigmarole really
amounts to.You began by asking for my wife's address, and when I did
not immediately gratify what I considered your impertinent curiosity,
you launch forth into vague threats of exposure.As far as I can make
out from your disjointed harangue, your excuse for prying into my
affairs is that by doing so you are protecting a helpless woman from
further ill-treatment.Granting that you really suppose me to
be a brute, your behaviour might be perfectly justified if--if you
believed that your patient is my wife.You think that she is either my mistress or my accomplice, or both.Now,
if she is a criminal and an immoral woman, you must admit that she has
shown extraordinary cleverness, inasmuch as she succeeded not only in
eluding the police but in deceiving you.For the impression she made on
you was a very favourable one, was it not?She seemed to you unusually
innocent as well as absolutely frank, didn't she?""Now, if she was able to dupe so trained an observer as yourself, she
must be a remarkable woman, and cannot be the helpless creature you
picture her, and consequently would be in no danger of being forced to
submit to abuse from any one.""But I think I can prove to you that you were not mistaken in your first
estimate of her character.This illness of hers--was it real or could it
have been feigned?""You saw her when she was only semi-conscious, when she was physically
incapable of acting a part--did she during that time, either by word or
look, betray moral perversity?"The doctor's anger had abated and he was listening to
Cyril intently."How, then, can you doubt her?And if she is what she seems, she is
certainly neither my mistress nor a thief; and if she is not the one nor
the other, she must be my wife, and if you go to the police with your
absurd suspicions, you will only succeed in making yourself ridiculous."There was a pause during which the two men eyed each other keenly."You make a great point of the fact that my wife had in her possession a
number of valuable ornaments," continued Cyril.My wife insisted on having all her jewelry with her at Charleroi, and
when she escaped from there, they were among the few things she took
with her.The excitement of meeting her so unexpectedly and her sudden
illness made me forget all about them, otherwise I would have taken them
out of the bag, which, as you may have noticed, was not even locked.But
the very fact that I did forget all about them and allowed them to pass
through the hands of nurses and servants, that alone ought to convince
you that I did not come by them dishonestly.You had them for days in
your possession; yet you accuse me of having prevented you from
examining them.Your whole case against me is
built on the wildest conjectures, from which you proceed to draw
perfectly untenable inferences.My wife looks young for her age, I grant
you; but even you would not venture to swear positively that she is not
twenty-eight.You fancied that I neglected her; consequently I am a
brute.She is sane now; so you believe that she has never been
otherwise.You imagined that I did not wish you to examine the contents
of my wife's bag, therefore the Wilmersley jewels must have been in it.""What you say sounds plausible enough," acknowledged the doctor, "and it
seems impossible to associate you with anything cruel, mean, or even
underhand, and yet--and yet--I have an unaccountable feeling that you
are not telling me the truth.When I try to analyse my impressions, I
find that I distrust not you but your story.You have, however,
convinced me that I have no logical basis for my suspicions.That being
the case, I shall do nothing for the present.But, if at the end of a
fortnight I do not hear that Lady Wilmersley has arrived in England, and
has taken her place in the world, then I shall believe that my instinct
has not been at fault, and shall do my best to find out what has become
of her, even at the risk of creating a scandal or of being laughed at
for my pains.But I don't care, I shall feel that I have done my duty.Now I have given you a fair
warning, which you can act on as you see fit."What an unerring scent the man had for falsehood, thought Cyril with
unwilling admiration.It was really wonderful the way he disregarded
probabilities and turned a deaf ear to reason.He was a big man, Cyril
grudgingly admitted."I suppose you will not believe me if I tell you that I have no personal
animosity toward you, Lord Wilmersley?"And some day we'll laugh over this episode together,"
replied Cyril, with a heartiness which surprised himself."Now that is nice of you," cried the doctor."My temper is rather hasty,
I am sorry to say, and though I don't remember all I said just now, I am
sure, I was unnecessarily disagreeable.""Well, I called you a fool," grinned Cyril."So you did, so you did, and may I live to acknowledge that I richly
deserve the appellation."And so their interview terminated with unexpected friendliness.CHAPTER XIII

CAMPBELL REMONSTRATES


In his note to Guy, Cyril had asked the latter to join him at his club
as soon as he had left Priscilla at the hotel, and so when the time
passed and his friend neither came nor telephoned, Cyril's anxiety knew
no bounds.In
that case, however, Guy would surely have communicated with him at once,
for the police could have had no excuse for detaining the latter.Several acquaintances he had not seen for years greeted him cordially,
but he met their advances so half-heartedly that they soon left him to
himself, firmly convinced that the title had turned his head.Only one,
an old friend of his father's, refused to be shaken off and sat prosing
away quite oblivious of his listener's preoccupation till the words
"your wife" arrested Cyril's wandering attention."Yes," the Colonel was saying, "too bad that you should have this added
worry just now.Taken ill on the train, too--most awkward."Cyril was so startled that he could only repeat idiotically: "My wife?"exclaimed the Colonel, evidently at a loss to understand
Cyril's perturbation."Your wife is in town, isn't she, and ill?"Cyril realised at once that he ought to have foreseen that this was
bound to have occurred.Too many people knew the story for it not to
have leaked out eventually."I have not had time to read them to-day," replied Cyril as soon as he
was able to collect his wits a little."Only that your wife had been prostrated by the shock of Wilmersley's
murder, and had to be removed from the train to a nursing home.""It's a bore that it got into the papers.My wife is only suffering from
a slight indisposition and will be all right in a day or two," Cyril
hastened to assure him."She--she is still at the nursing home--but she is leaving there
to-morrow."Then fearing that more questions were impending, Cyril
seized the Colonel's hand and shaking it vehemently exclaimed: "I must
write some letters.So glad to have had this chat with you," and without
giving the Colonel time to answer, he fled from the room.Suddenly an alarming possibility occurred to him,--what if
the police had traced the jewels to Campbell?The bag, which had
disappeared, must have been taken by them.Griggs, when he inquired so
innocently about "Lady Wilmersley," had been fully cognisant of the
girl's identity.He could not remain passive
and await developments.He must--was that--could that be Campbell
sauntering so leisurely toward him?asked Cyril in a hoarse whisper, dragging his
friend into a secluded corner.I am afraid I kept you waiting longer than I
intended to.Guy seemed, however,
quite unconcerned.How could you
have kept me in such suspense?Why didn't you come to me at once on
leaving Miss Prentice?"The governess, Miss What's her name, is
with her?"Thompkins alone with a
stranger in a strange place, so I stayed and lunched with them."_He_ had had no lunch at all.He had been
too upset to think of such a thing and all the time they--oh!He would never forgive
him, thought Cyril, scowling down at the complacent offender.For he was
complacent, that was the worst of it.From the top of his sleek, red
head to the tips of his immaculate boots, he radiated a triumphant
self-satisfaction.There was a jauntiness about him--a light in
his eyes which Cyril did not remember to have noticed before.And what
was the meaning of those two violets drooping so sentimentally in his
buttonhole?Cyril stared at the flowers as if hypnotised.he managed to say, controlling himself
with an effort.But I say, Cyril, it's all rot about her being that Prentice
woman."asked Cyril, forgetting his indignation in
his surprise at this new development."We had a duffer of a waiter who understood very little English, so Mrs.Thompkins spoke to him in French, and such French!How could a girl brought up in a small inland
village, which she had left only six months before, have learnt French?And then he remembered that the doctor had told him that she had
retained a dim recollection of Paris.Why had the significance of that
fact not struck him before?"But if she is not Priscilla Prentice, who on earth can she be?She
can't be Anita Wilmersley!"She--she--" Guy paused at a loss for a suggestion."And yet, if she is not the sempstress, she must be Anita!""I don't believe they are the Wilmersley jewels----"

"There is no doubt as to that.I have the list somewhere and you can
easily verify it."It may have been left in the seat by some one
else.""But you proved to me last night that she could not be Lady Wilmersley,"
insisted Guy.Anita has masses of bright, yellow hair."Well, then----"

"There seems no possible explanation to the enigma," acknowledged Cyril.When she fainted I loosened her veil and a strand of her
hair caught in my fingers.It was her own, I can swear to that.""I never thought of that," exclaimed Cyril."No, I don't think she could
have had time to dye it.At nine, when she
was last seen, she had made no attempt to alter her appearance.Now
Wilmersley was----"

"Hold on," cried Guy."You told me, did you not, that she had cut off
her hair because it had turned white?""Very well, then, that disposes of the possibility of its having been
dyed."And yet, she carried the Wilmersley jewels, that is a fact
we must not forget.""Then she must be a hitherto unsuspected factor in the case.""Possibly, and yet---"

"Yet what?""I confess I have no other solution to offer.Oh, by the way, what is
the number of her room?"I particularly asked you to make a note of it!"Guy's face was averted and he toyed nervously with his
eye-glass.You must realise--in fact we discussed it
together--that I must be able to see her.""As there is nothing that you can do for her, why should you compromise
her still further?""I mean that you ought not to take further advantage of her peculiar
affliction so as to play the part of a devoted husband.""This is outrageous--" began Cyril, but Campbell cut him short."While you fancied that she was in need of your assistance, I grant that
there was some excuse for your conduct, but to continue the farce any
longer would be positively dishonourable."Cyril was so surprised at Campbell's belligerent tone that for a moment
it rendered him speechless.From a boy Guy had always been his humble
admirer.What could have wrought this sudden change in him?Again his eyes lingered on the violets.And
yet Cyril had often suspected that under Guy's obvious shrewdness there
lurked a vein of romanticism.And as Cyril surveyed his friend, his
wrath slowly cooled.For the first time it occurred to him that
Campbell's almost comic exterior must be a real grief to a man of his
temperament.His own appearance had always seemed to Cyril such a
negligible quantity that he shrank from formulating even in his own mind
the reason why he felt that it would be absurd to fear Guy as a rival.A
man who is not to be feared is a man to be pitied, and it was this
unacknowledged pity, together with a sudden suspicion of the possible
tragedy of his friend's life, which allayed Cyril's indignation and made
him finally reply gently:

"I think you are mistaken.Miss Trevor and I are quite able to look after her.""I don't doubt your goodwill, my dear Guy, but what about her feelings?"Do
you imagine that she will be inconsolable at your absence?""You appear to forget that she believes me to be her husband.Her
pride--her vanity will be hurt if I appear to neglect her."Cyril still
spoke very quietly."Then I will tell her the truth at once," exclaimed Campbell."And risk the recurrence of her illness?Remember the doctor insisted
that she must on no account be agitated.""Why should it agitate her to be told that you are not her husband?I
should think it would be a jolly sight more agitating to believe one's
self bound to a perfect stranger.It is a wonder it has not driven the
poor child crazy.""Luckily she took the sad news very calmly," Cyril could not refrain
from remarking.Really, Guy was intolerable and he longed with a
primitive longing to punch his head.Guy
was capable of being nasty, if not handled carefully.So he hastily
continued:

"How can you undeceive her on one point without explaining the whole
situation to her?""I--" began Guy, "I--" He paused.Even you have to
acknowledge that the relief of knowing that she is not my wife might be
offset by learning not only that we are quite in the dark as to who she
is, but that at any moment she may be arrested on a charge of murder."And leave you to insinuate yourself
into her--affections!She must be told the truth some day, but by that
time she may have grown to--to--love you."That fact evidently seems 'too trifling'
to be considered, but I fancy she will not regard it as casually as you
do.""This is absurd," began Cyril, but Guy intercepted him."You feel free to do as you please because you expect to get a divorce,
but you have not got it yet, remember, and in the meantime your wife may
bring a countersuit, naming Miss--Mrs."And in that case," continued Campbell, "she would probably think that
she ought to marry you.After having been dragged through the filth of a
divorce court, she would imagine herself too besmirched to give herself
to any other man.And your wealth, your title, and your precious self
may not seem to her as desirable as you suppose.She is the sort of girl
who would think them a poor exchange for the loss of her reputation and
her liberty of choice.When she discovers how you have compromised her
by your asinine stupidity, I don't fancy that she will take a lenient
view of your conduct.""You seem to forget that if I had not shielded her with my name, she
would undoubtedly have been arrested on the train.""Oh, I don't doubt you meant well.""Thanks," murmured Cyril sarcastically."All I say is that you must not see her again till this mystery is
cleared up.I didn't forget about the number of her apartment, but I
wasn't going to help you to sneak in to her at all hours.Now, if you
want to see her, you will have to go boldly up to the hotel and have
yourself properly announced.And I don't think you will care about
that.""I don't care a fig for your promises.You shan't see her as long as she
believes you to be her husband."Luckily the room was empty, for both men had risen to their feet."I shall see her," repeated Cyril."If you do, I warn you that I shall tell her the truth and risk the
consequences.She shall not, if I can help it, be placed in a position
where she will be forced to marry a man who has, after all, lived his
life."She ought, in other words, to be given the choice between my battered
heart and your virgin affections."I mean----"

"Oh, you have made your meaning quite clear, I assure you!""But what you have been saying is sheer nonsense.You have been
calling me to account for things that have not happened, and blaming me
for what I have not done.She is not being dragged through the divorce
court, and I see no reason to suppose that she ever will be.I am not
trying to force her to marry me, and can promise that I shall never do
so.Far from taking advantage of the situation, I assure you my conduct
has been most circumspect.Don't cross a bridge till you get to it, and
don't accuse a man of being a cad just because--" Cyril paused abruptly
and looked at Guy, and as he did so, his expression slowly relaxed till
he finally smiled indulgently--"just because a certain lady is very
charming," he added.He would neither retract nor modify his
ultimatum.He knew, of course, that Cyril would not dare to write the
girl; for if the letter miscarried or was found by the police, it might
be fatal to both.But while they were still heatedly debating the question, a way suddenly
occurred to Cyril by which he could communicate with her with absolute
safety.So he waited placidly for Guy to take himself off, which he
eventually did, visibly elated at having, as he thought, effectually put
a stop to further intercourse between the two.He had hardly left the
club, however, before Cyril was talking to Priscilla over the telephone!He explained to her as best he could that he had been called out of town
for a few days, and begged her on no account to leave her apartments
till he returned.He also tried to impress on her that she had better
talk about him as little as possible and above all things not to mention
either to Campbell or Miss Trevor that she had heard from him and
expected to see him before long.It cost Cyril a tremendous effort to restrict himself to necessary
instructions and polite inquiries, especially as she kept begging him to
come back to her as soon as possible.Finally he could bear the strain
no longer, and in the middle of a sentence he resolutely hung up the
receiver.CHAPTER XIV

WHAT IS THE TRUTH?When Cyril arrived in Newhaven that evening, he was unpleasantly
surprised to find, as he got out of the train, that Judson had been
travelling in the adjoining compartment.Had the man been following him,
or was it simply chance that had brought them together, he wondered.If he could only get rid of the fellow!"You have come to see me, I suppose," he remarked ungraciously."Very well, then, get into the car."Cyril was in no mood to talk, so the first part of the way was
accomplished in silence, but at last, thinking that he might as well
hear what the man had to say, he turned to him and asked:

"Have you found out anything of any importance?""If you will excuse me, my lord, I should suggest that we wait till we
get to the castle," replied Judson, casting a meaning look at the
chauffeur's back.His contempt for Judson was so great that Cyril
was not very curious to hear his revelations."Now," said Cyril, as he flung himself into a low chair before the
library fire, "what have you to tell me?"Before answering Judson peered cautiously around; then, drawing forward
a straight-backed chair, he seated himself close to Cyril and folded his
hands in his lap."In dealing with my clients," he began, "I make it a rule instead of
simply stating the results of my work to show them how I arrive at my
conclusions.Having submitted to them all the facts I have collected,
they are able to judge for themselves as to the value of the evidence on
which my deductions are based.And so, my lord, I should like to go over
the whole case with you from the very beginning."Cyril gave a grunt which Judson evidently construed into an assent, for
he continued even more glibly:

"The first point I considered was, whether her Ladyship had premeditated
her escape.But in order to determine this, we must first decide whom
she could have got to help her to accomplish such a purpose.The most
careful inquiry has failed to reveal any one who would have been both
willing and able to do so, except the sempstress, and as both mistress
and maid disappeared almost simultaneously, one's first impulse is to
take it for granted that Prentice was her Ladyship's accomplice.This is
what every one, Scotland Yard included, believes.""Before either accepting or rejecting this theory, I decided to visit
this girl's home.I did not feel clear in my mind about her.All the
servants were impressed by her manner and personality, the butler
especially so, and he more than hinted that there must be some mystery
attached to her.One of the things that stimulated their curiosity was
that she kept up a daily correspondence with some one in Plumtree.On
reaching the village I called at once on the vicar.He is an elderly
man, much respected and beloved by his parishioners.I found him in a
state of great excitement, having just read in the paper of Prentice's
disappearance.I had no difficulty in inducing him to tell me the main
facts of her history; the rest I picked up from the village gossips.And till she came to Geralton she was an inmate of
the vicar's household.He told me that he would have adopted her, but
knowing that he had not sufficient means to provide for her future, he
wisely refrained from educating her above her station.Nevertheless, I
gathered that the privilege of his frequent companionship had refined
her speech and manners, and I am told that she now could pass muster in
any drawing-room.""Not that I know of, and I do not believe the vicar would have taught
her an accomplishment so useless to one in her position.""No matter--I--but go on with your story.""Owing partly to the mystery which surrounded her birth and gave rise to
all sorts of rumours, and partly to her own personality, the gentry of
the neighbourhood made quite a pet of her.As a child she was asked
occasionally to play with the Squire's crippled daughter and later she
used to go to the Hall three times a week to read aloud to her.So,
notwithstanding the vicar's good intentions, she grew up to be neither
'fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring.'Now all went well till about
a year ago, when the Squire's eldest son returned home and fell in love
with her.His people naturally opposed the match and, as he is entirely
dependent upon them, there seemed no possibility of his marrying her.The girl appeared broken-hearted, and when she came to the castle, every
one, the vicar included, thought the affair at an end.I am sure,
however, that such was not the case, for as no one at the vicarage wrote
to her daily, the letters she received must have come from her young
man.Furthermore, she told the servants that she had a cousin in
Newhaven, but as she has not a relative in the world, this is obviously
a falsehood.Who, then, is this mysterious person she visited?It seems
to me almost certain that it was her lover.""But I don't quite see what you are trying to
prove by all this.If Prentice did not help her Ladyship to escape, who
did?""I have not said that Prentice is not a factor in the case, only I
believe her part to have been a very subordinate one.Of one thing,
however, I am sure, and that is that she did not return to Geralton on
the night of the murder.""Because she asked for permission early in the morning to spend the
night in Newhaven and had already left the castle before the doctors'
visit terminated.Now, although I think it probable that her Ladyship
may for a long time have entertained the idea of leaving Geralton, yet I
believe that it was the doctors' visit that gave the necessary impetus
to convert her idle longing into definite action.Therefore I conclude
that Prentice could have had no knowledge of her mistress's sudden
flight.""But how can you know that the whole thing had not been carefully
premeditated?""Because her Ladyship showed such agitation and distress at hearing the
doctors' verdict.If her plans for leaving the castle had been
completed, she would have accepted the situation more calmly."We have been able to trace them only as far as London.They
could not have been reputable physicians or they would have answered our
advertisements, and so I am inclined to believe that you were right and
that it was his Lordship who spread the rumours of her Ladyship's
insanity.""I am sure of it," said Cyril.Assuming, therefore, that Lady Wilmersley is sane, we will
proceed to draw logical inferences from her actions."Judson paused a
moment before continuing: "Now I am convinced that the only connection
Prentice had with the affair was to procure some clothes for her
mistress, and these had probably been sometime in the latter's
possession.""I think it would have been pretty
difficult to have concealed anything from that maid of hers.""Difficult, I grant you, but not impossible, my lord.""But if Prentice had no knowledge of the tragedy, why did she not return
to the castle?Why have the police been unable
to find her?""I believe that she joined her lover and that they are together on the
continent, for in Plumtree I was told that the young man had recently
gone to Paris.As I am sure that she knows nothing of any importance, I
thought it useless to waste time and money trying to discover their
exact locality.That the police have not succeeded in finding her, I
ascribe to the fact that they are looking for a young woman who left
Newhaven after and not before the murder.""Yes, and I have two reasons for this supposition.First, I can discover
no place where he or she, either separately or together, could have
spent the night.Secondly, if they had left Newhaven the following
morning or in fact at any time after the murder, they would certainly
have been apprehended, as all the boats and trains were most carefully
watched.""But no one knew of her disappearance till twenty-four hours later, and
during that interval she could easily have got away unobserved.""No, my lord, there you are mistaken.From the moment that the police
were notified that a crime had been committed, every one, especially
every woman, who left Newhaven was most attentively scrutinised.""You are certain that Prentice could not have left Newhaven unnoticed,
yet her Ladyship managed to do so!The detective paused a moment and looked fixedly at Cyril."Her Ladyship had a very powerful protector, my lord," he finally said."It's no use beating about the bush, my lord, I know everything.""Well then, out with it," cried Cyril impatiently.Have you found her Ladyship or have you not?"Then why on earth didn't you tell me at once?There was a pause during which the detective regarded Cyril through
narrowed lids."She is at present at the nursing home of Dr.Stuart-Smith," he said at
last.exclaimed Cyril, sinking back into his chair and negligently
lighting another cigarette.You
mean my wife, Lady Wilmersley----"

"Pardon me for interrupting you, my lord.I repeat, the Dowager Lady Wilmersley is under the care of Dr.The man's tone was so assured that Cyril was staggered for a moment."It isn't true," he asserted angrily."Is it possible that you really do not know who the lady is that you
rescued that day from the police?"exclaimed the detective, startled out
of his habitual impassivity.But of one thing I am sure, and that is that
she is not the person you suppose.""Well, my lord, I must say that you have surprised me."I tell you that you are on the wrong track."She has not, for it has turned completely white," exclaimed Cyril,
triumphantly."Her Ladyship is cleverer than I supposed," remarked the detective with
a pitying smile."I am not such a fool as you seem to think," retorted Cyril."And I can
assure you that the lady in question is incapable of deception.""All I can say is, my lord, that I am absolutely sure of her Ladyship's
identity and that you yourself gave me the clue to her whereabouts.""I of course noticed that when you heard her Ladyship had golden hair,
you were not only extremely surprised but also very much relieved.I at
once asked myself why such an apparently trivial matter should have so
great and so peculiar an effect on you.As you had never seen her
Ladyship, I argued that you must that very day have met some one you had
reason to suppose to be Lady Wilmersley and that this person had dark
hair.By following your movements from the time you landed I found that
the only woman with whom you had come in contact was a young lady who
had joined you in Newhaven, and that she answered to the description of
Lady Wilmersley in every particular, with the sole exception that she
had dark hair!I was, however, told that you had said that she was your
wife and had produced a passport to prove it.Now I had heard from your
valet that her Ladyship was still in France, so you can hardly blame me
for doubting the correctness of your statement.But in order to make
assurance doubly sure, I sent one of my men to the continent.He
reported that her Ladyship had for some months been a patient at
Charleroi, but had recently escaped from there, and that you are still
employing detectives to find her.""I did not engage you to pry into my affairs," exclaimed Cyril savagely."Nor have I exceeded my duty as I conceive it," retorted the detective."As your Lordship refused to honour me with your confidence, I had to
find out the facts by other means; and you must surely realise that
without facts it is impossible for me to construct a theory, and till I
can do that my work is practically valueless.""But my wife has nothing to do with the case.""Quite so, my lord, but a lady who claimed to be her Ladyship is
intimately concerned with it.""If your Lordship will listen to me, I think I can prove to you that as
far as the lady's identity is concerned, I have made no mistake.But to
do this convincingly, I must reconstruct the tragedy as I conceive that
it happened.""Go ahead; I don't mind hearing your theory.""First, I must ask you to take it for granted that I am right in
believing that Prentice was ignorant of her Ladyship's flight.""I will admit that much," agreed Cyril.Now let us try and imagine exactly what was her
Ladyship's position on the night of the murder.Her first care must have
been to devise some means of eluding his Lordship's vigilance.This was
a difficult problem, for Mustapha tells me that his Lordship was not
only a very light sleeper but that he suffered from chronic insomnia.You may or may not know that his Lordship had long been addicted to the
opium habit and would sometimes for days together lie in a stupor.Large
quantities of the drug were found in his room and that explains how her
Ladyship managed to get hold of the opium with which she doctored his
Lordship's coffee.""This is, however, mere supposition on your part," objected Cyril.I had the sediment of the two cups analysed and
the chemist found that one of them contained a small quantity of opium.Her Ladyship, being practically ignorant as to the exact nature of the
drug and of the effect it would have on a man who was saturated with it,
gave his Lordship too small a dose.Nevertheless, he became immediately
stupefied.""Now, how on earth can you know that?"If his Lordship had not been rendered at once
unconscious, he would--knowing that an attempt had been made to drug
him--have sounded the alarm and deputed Mustapha to guard her Ladyship,
which was what he always did when he knew that he was not equal to the
task.""Well, that sounds plausible, at all events," acknowledged Cyril."As soon as her Ladyship knew that she was no longer watched," continued
the detective, "she at once set to work to disguise herself.As we know,
she had provided herself with clothes, but I fancy her hair, her most
noticeable feature, must have caused her some anxious moments.""She may have worn a wig," suggested Cyril, hoping that Judson would
accept this explanation of the difficulty, in which case he would be
able triumphantly to demolish the latter's theory of the girl's
identity, by stating that he could positively swear that her hair was
her own.After carefully investigating the matter I have come to
the conclusion that she did not.And my reasons are, first, that no
hairdresser in Newhaven has lately sold a dark wig to any one, and,
secondly, that no parcel arrived, addressed either to her Ladyship or to
Prentice, which could have contained such an article.On the other hand,
as his Lordship had for years dyed his hair and beard, her Ladyship had
only to go into his dressing-room to procure a very simple means of
transforming herself.""But doesn't it take ages to dye hair?""If it is done properly, yes; but the sort of stain his Lordship used
can be very quickly applied.I do not believe it took her Ladyship more
than half an hour to dye enough of her hair to escape notice, but in all
probability she had no time to do it very thoroughly and that which
escaped may have turned white.This was a possibility which had not occurred to Cyril; but still he
refused to be convinced.Let me continue my story: Before her Ladyship had
completed her preparations, his Lordship awoke from his stupor.""Because, if his Lordship had not tried to prevent her escape, she would
have had no reason for killing him.Probably they had a struggle, her
hand fell on the pistol, and the deed was done----"

"But what about the ruined picture?""Her Ladyship, knowing that there was no other portrait of her in
existence, destroyed it in order to make it difficult for the police to
follow her.""You make her Ladyship out a nice, cold-blooded,
calculating sort of person.If you think she at all resembles the young
lady at the nursing home, I can only tell you that you are vastly
mistaken.""As I have not the honour of knowing the lady in question, I cannot form
any opinion as to that.But let us continue: I wish to confess at once
that I am not at all sure how her Ladyship reached Newhaven.On the face of it, it seems as
if it must have some connection with the case.I have also a feeling
that it has, and yet for the life of me I cannot discover the connecting
link.Whatever the younger man was, the elder was undoubtedly a
Frenchman, and I have ascertained that with the exception of an old
French governess, who lived with her Ladyship before her marriage, and
of Mustapha and Valdriguez, Lady Wilmersley knew no foreigner whatever.Besides, these two men seem to have been motoring about the country
almost at random, and it may have been the merest accident which brought
them to the foot of the long lane just at the time when her Ladyship was
in all probability leaving the castle.Whether they gave her a lift as
far as Newhaven, I do not know.How her Ladyship reached the town
constitutes the only serious--I will not call it break--but hiatus--in
my theory.From half-past six the next morning, however, her movements
can be easily followed.A young lady, dressed as you know, approached
the station with obvious nervousness.Three things attracted the
attention of the officials: first, the discrepancy between the
simplicity, I might almost say the poverty, of her clothes, and the fact
that she purchased a first-class ticket; secondly, that she did not wish
her features to be seen; and thirdly, that she had no luggage except a
small hand-bag.How her Ladyship managed to elude the police, and what
has subsequently occurred to her, I do not need to tell your Lordship.""You haven't in the least convinced me that the young lady is her
Ladyship, not in the least.You yourself admit that there is a hiatus in
your story; well, that hiatus is to me a gulf which you have failed to
bridge.Because one lady disappears from Geralton and another appears
the next morning in Newhaven, you insist the two are identical.But you
have not offered me one iota of proof that such is the case."She is the only person who left Newhaven
by train or boat who even vaguely resembled her Ladyship."Her Ladyship may not have come to Newhaven at all,
but have been driven to some hiding-place in the Frenchman's car.""I think that quite impossible, for every house, every cottage, every
stable and barn even, for twenty-five miles around, has been carefully
searched.Besides, this would mean that the murder had been premeditated
and the coming of the motor had been pre-arranged; and lastly, as the
gardener's wife testifies that the car left Geralton certainly no
earlier than eleven-thirty, and as the two men reached the hotel before
twelve, this precludes the possibility that they could have done more
than drive straight back to the Inn, as the motor is by no means a fast
one.""But, my man, they may have secreted her Ladyship in the town itself and
have taken her with them to France the next morning."In the first place, they left alone, the porter saw them
off; and secondly, no one except the two Frenchmen purchased a ticket
for the continent either in the Newhaven office or on the boat."Judson's logic was horribly convincing; no
smallest detail had apparently escaped him.As the man piled argument on
argument, he had found himself slowly and grudgingly accepting his
conclusions."As you are in my employ, I take it for granted that you will not inform
the police or the press of your--suspicions," he said at last.On the other hand, I must ask you to allow me
to withdraw from the case.""Because my duty to you, as my client, prevents me from taking any
further steps in this matter.""I gather that you are less anxious to clear up the mystery than to
protect her Ladyship."You would even wish me to assist you in providing a safe retreat for
her.""Well, my lord, that is just what I cannot do.It is my duty, as I
conceive it, to hold my tongue, but I should not feel justified in
aiding her Ladyship to escape the consequences of her--her--action.In
order to be faithful to my engagement to you, I am willing to let the
public believe that I have made a failure of the case.I shall not even
allow my imagination to dwell on your future movements, but more than
that I cannot do.""You take the position that her Ladyship is an ordinary criminal, but
you must realise that that is absurd.Even granting that she is
responsible for her husband's death--of which, by the way, we have no
absolute proof--are you not able to make allowances for a poor woman
goaded to desperation by an opium fiend?""I do not constitute myself her Ladyship's judge, but I don't think your
Lordship quite realises all that you are asking of me.Even if I were
willing to waive the question of my professional honour, I should still
decline to undertake a task which, I know, is foredoomed to failure.For, if _I_ discovered Lady Wilmersley with so little difficulty,
Scotland Yard is bound to do so before long.It is impossible--absolutely impossible, I assure you,
that the secret can be kept.""I wish I could convince your Lordship of this and induce you to allow
the law to take its course.Her Ladyship ought to come forward at once
and plead justifiable homicide.If she waits till she is arrested, it
will tell heavily against her.""But she is ill, really ill," insisted Cyril.Stuart-Smith tells me
that if she is not kept perfectly quiet for the next few weeks, her
nervous system may never recover from the shock."That certainly complicates the situation; on the other hand, you
must remember that discovery is not only inevitable but imminent, and
that the police will not stop to consider her Ladyship's nervous system.No, my lord, the only thing for you to do is to break the news to her
yourself and to persuade her to give herself up.If you don't, you will
both live to regret it.""That may be so," replied Cyril after a minute's hesitation, "but in
this matter I must judge for myself.I still hope that you are wrong and
that either the young woman in question is not Lady Wilmersley or that
it was not her Ladyship who killed my cousin, and I refuse to jeopardise
her life till I am sure that there is no possibility of your having made
a mistake.So far you have only sought
for evidence which would strengthen your theory of her Ladyship's guilt,
now I want you to look at the case from a fresh point of view.I want
you to start all over again and to work on the assumption that her
Ladyship did not fire the shot.I cannot accept your conclusion as final
till we have exhausted every other possibility.These Frenchmen, for
instance, have they or have they not a connection with the case?At the
inquest she acknowledged that no one had seen her leave her Ladyship's
apartments and we have only her word for it that she spent the evening
in her room."But, if I went on the principle of suspecting every one who
cannot prove themselves innocent, I should soon be lost in a quagmire of
barren conjectures.Of course, I have considered Valdriguez, but I can
find no reason for suspecting her.""Well, I could give you a dozen reasons.""Indeed, my lord, and what are they?""In the first place, we know that she is a hard, unprincipled woman, or
she would never have consented to aid my cousin in depriving his
unfortunate wife of her liberty.A woman who would do that, is capable
of any villainy.Then, on the witness-stand didn't you feel that she was
holding something back?Oh, I forgot you were not present at the
inquest.""I was there, my lord, but I took good care that no one should recognise
me.""Well, and what impression did she make on you?"I think she spoke the truth and I
fancy that she is almost a religious fanatic.""You don't mean to say, Judson, that you allowed yourself to be taken in
by her sanctimonious airs and the theatrical way that she kept clutching
at that cross on her breast?Why, don't you
see that no woman with a spark of religion in her could have allowed her
mistress to be treated as Lady Wilmersley was?""Quite so, my lord, and it is because Valdriguez impressed me as an
honest old creature that I am still doubtful whether her Ladyship is
insane or not, and this uncertainty hampers me very much in my work.""Lady Upton assured me that her granddaughter's mind had never been
unbalanced and that his Lordship, although he frequently wrote to her,
had never so much as hinted at such a thing; and if you believe the
young lady at the nursing home to be Lady Wilmersley, I give you my word
that she shows no sign of mental derangement.""Well, that seems pretty final, and yet--and yet--I cannot believe that
Valdriguez is a vicious woman.A man in my profession acquires a curious
instinct in such matters, my lord."The detective paused a moment and
when he began again, he spoke almost as if he were reasoning with
himself."Now, if my estimate of Valdriguez is correct, and if it is
also a fact that Lady Wilmersley has never been insane, there are
certainly possibilities connected with this affair which I have by no
means exhausted--and so, my lord, I am not only willing but anxious to
continue on the case, if you will agree to allow me to ignore her
Ladyship's existence."But tell me, Judson, how can you hope to reconcile two such
absolutely contradictory facts?""Two such apparently contradictory facts," gently corrected the
detective."Well, my lord, I propose to find out more of this woman's
antecedents.I have several times tried to get her to talk, but so far
without the least success.She says that she will answer any question
put to her on the witness-stand, but that it is against her principles
to gossip about her late master and mistress.She is equally reticent as
to her past life and when I told her that her silence seemed to me very
suspicious, she demanded--suspicious of what?She went on to say that
she could not see that it was anybody's business, where she lived or
what she had done, and that she had certainly no intention of gratifying
my idle curiosity; and that was the last word I could get out of her.Although she treated me so cavalierly, I confess to a good deal of
sympathy with her attitude.""She was
housekeeper here when Valdriguez first came to Geralton and ought to be
able to tell you what sort of person she was in her youth."The only thing she told me which may
have a bearing on the case is, that in the old days his Lordship
appeared to admire Valdriguez very much.""But we cannot be too sure of this, my lord.For when I tried to find
out what grounds she had for her statement, she had so little proof to
offer that I cannot accept her impression as conclusive evidence.As far
as I can make out, the gossip about them was started by his Lordship
going to the Catholic church in Newhaven."Not a very compromising act on his Lordship's part, one would
think.But as his Lordship was not a Catholic, his doing so naturally
aroused a good deal of comment.At first the neighbourhood feared that
he had been converted by his mother, who had often lamented that she had
not been allowed to bring up her son in her own faith.It was soon
noticed, however, that whenever his Lordship attended a popish service,
his mother's pretty maid was invariably present, and so people began to
put two and two together and before long it was universally assumed that
she was the magnet which had drawn him away from his own church.Eversley if they had been seen together elsewhere, and she
reluctantly admitted that they had.On several occasions they were seen
walking in the Park but always, so Mrs.Eversley assured me, in full
view of the castle.She had felt it her duty to speak to Valdriguez on
the subject, and the latter told her that his Lordship was interested in
her religion and that she was willing to run the risk of having her
conduct misconstrued if she could save his soul from eternal damnation.Eversley to understand that she had her mistress's
sanction, and as her Ladyship treated Valdriguez more as a companion and
friend than as a maid, Mrs.Eversley thought this quite likely and did
not venture to remonstrate further.So the intimacy, if such it could be
called, continued as before.What the outcome of this state of things
would have been we do not know, for shortly afterwards both Lord and
Lady Wilmersley died and Valdriguez left Geralton.When his Lordship
went away a few weeks later, a good many people suspected that he had
joined her on the continent.Eversley, however, does not believe
this.She has the most absolute confidence in Valdriguez's virtue, and I
think her testimony is pretty reliable."Eversley is an honest, simple old soul.A clever adventuress
would have little difficulty in hoodwinking her.Mark my words, you have
found the key to the mystery.What more likely than that his
Lordship--whose morals, even as a boy, were none of the best--seduced
Valdriguez and that she returned to Geralton so as to have the
opportunity of avenging her wrongs.""I can think of nothing more unlikely than that his Lordship should have
selected his cast-off mistress as his wife's attendant," Judson drily
remarked.You didn't know him," replied Cyril."I can quite fancy
that the situation would have appealed to his cynical humour.""Your opinion of the late Lord Wilmersley is certainly not flattering,
but even if we take for granted that such an arrangement would not have
been impossible to his Lordship, I still refuse to believe that
Valdriguez would have agreed to it; even assuming that his Lordship had
wronged her and that she had nursed a murderous resentment against him
all these years, I cannot see how she could have hoped to further her
object by accepting the humiliating position of his wife's maid.It also
seems to me incredible that a woman whose passions were so violent as to
find expression in murder could have controlled them during a lifetime.But leaving aside these considerations, I have another reason to urge
against your theory: Would his Lordship have trusted a woman who, he
knew, had a grievance against him, as he certainly trusted Valdriguez?What was there to have prevented
her from giving him an overdose of some drug during one of the many
times when he was half-stupefied with opium?The risk of
detection would have been infinitesimal.No, my lord, why Valdriguez
returned to Geralton is an enigma, I grant you, but your explanation
does not satisfy me.""As long as you acknowledge that Valdriguez's presence here needs an
explanation and are willing to work to find that explanation, I don't
care whether you accept my theory or not; all I want to get at is the
truth.""The truth, my lord," said the detective, as he rose to take his leave,
"is often more praised than appreciated."CHAPTER XV

FINGER PRINTS IN THE DUST


As Cyril sat toying with his dinner, it was little by little borne in on
him that the butler had something on his mind.How he got this
impression he really did not know, for Douglas performed his duties as
precisely, as unobtrusively as ever.Yet long before the last course had
been reached, Cyril was morally certain that he had not been mistaken.He waited for the dessert to be placed on the table; then, having
motioned the footmen to leave the room, he half turned to the butler,
who was standing behind his chair.The man stepped forward, so as to face his master.asked Cyril, scrutinising the other
attentively.The abrupt question seemed neither to surprise nor to discompose the
butler; yet he hesitated before finally answering:

"I--I don't quite know, my lord.""You must know whether or not
something has happened to upset you.""Well, my lord--it's this way, my lord--Susan, the upper 'ousemaid, says
as how there has been somebody or--" here his voice sank to a whisper
and he cast an apprehensive glance over his shoulder--"or something in
the library last night!"Cyril put down the glass of wine he was carrying to his lips untasted."She thinks she saw a ghost in the library?"She didn't see anything, but this morning she found
finger-marks on the top of his Lordship's desk."One of the servants may have gone in there out of
curiosity.""But what would anybody be doing there in the night, I should like to
know?And Susan says those marks could only 'ave been made last night,
my lord.""On account of the dust, my lord.It takes time for dust to settle and a
'ousemaid, who knows 'er business, can tell, after she's been in a place
a couple of months, just about 'ow long it's been since any particular
piece of furniture has been dusted.No young
'ousemaid can pull the wool over 'er eyes, I can tell you.""Does every one know of Susan's suspicions?"Susan's a sensible woman, and though she was frightened
something terrible, she only told Mrs.Eversley told
me and we three agreed we'd hold our tongues.Every one's that upset as
it is, that they'd all 'ave 'ighstrikes if they knew that It was
walking."But even
if there were such things, an intangible spirit couldn't possibly leave
finger-marks behind it.""But, my lord, if you'll excuse me, my aunt's cousin--" began the
butler, but Cyril cut him short."I have no time now to hear about your aunt's cousin, though no doubt it
is a most interesting story.Susan had, however, no further information to impart.She was positive
that the marks must have been made some time during the night."And it's my belief they were made by a skeleton hand," she added."And
as for going into that room again, indeed I just couldn't, not for
nobody, meaning no disrespect to your Lordship; and as for the other
'ousemaids, they'll not go near the place either and haven't been since
the murder.""Very well, Susan, I shall not ask you to do so.Those rooms shall not
be opened again till this mystery is cleared up.I will go now and lock
them up myself."Striding rapidly across the hall, Cyril opened the door of the library.This part of the castle had been equipped with electric light and steam
heat, and as he stepped into the darkness, the heavy-scented air almost
made him reel.Having found the switch, he noticed at once that the room
had indefinably changed since he had been in it last.Notwithstanding
the heat, notwithstanding the flood of crimson light, which permeated
even the farthest corners, it had already assumed the chill, gloomy
aspect of an abandoned apartment.Stooping over the desk, he eagerly inspected the marks which had so
startled the housemaid.Yes, they were still quite visible, although a
delicate film of dust had already begun to soften the precision of their
outline--very strange!They certainly did look like the imprint of
skeleton fingers.His fingers left a
mark at least twice as wide as those of the mysterious visitant.For a long time he stood with bent head pondering deeply; then, throwing
back his shoulders, as if he had arrived at some decision, he proceeded
to explore the entire suite.Having satisfied himself that no one was
secreted on the premises, he turned off the light, shut the door--but he
did not turn the key.Some hours later Cyril, in his great four-posted bed, lay watching, with
wide-open eyes, the fantastic shadows thrown by the dancing firelight on
the panelled walls.To woo sleep was evidently not his intention, for
from time to time he lighted a wax vesta and consulted the watch he held
in his hand.At last the hour seemed to satisfy him, for he got out of
bed and made a hasty toilet.Having accomplished this as best he could
in the semi-obscurity, he slipped a pistol into his pocket and left his
room.Groping his way through the darkness, he descended the stairs and
cautiously traversed the hall.His stockinged
feet moved noiselessly over the heavy carpet.At the door of the library
he paused a moment and listened intently; then, pistol in hand, he threw
open the door.Closing the
door behind him, he lighted a match and carefully inspected the desk.Having assured himself that no fresh marks had appeared on its polished
surface, he blew out the match and ensconced himself as comfortably as
the limited space permitted behind the curtains of one of the windows.There he waited patiently for what seemed to him an eternity.He had
just begun to fear that his vigil would prove fruitless, when his ear
was gladdened by a slight sound.A moment later the light was switched
on.Hardly daring to breathe, Cyril peered through the curtains.Cyril's heart gave a bound of exultation.Had he not guessed
that those marks could only have been made by her small, bony fingers?Clad like a nun in a loose, black garment, which fell in straight,
austere folds to her feet; a black shawl, thrown over her head, casting
strange shadows on her pale, haggard face, she advanced slowly, almost
majestically, into the room.Cyril had to acknowledge that she looked
more like a medieval saint than a midnight marauder.Evidently the woman had no fear of detection, for she never even cast
one suspicious glance around her; nor did she appear to feel that there
was any necessity for haste, for she lingered for some time near the
writing-table, gazing at it, as if it had a fascination for her; but,
finally, she turned away with a hopeless sigh and directed her attention
to the bookcase.This she proceeded to examine in the most methodical
manner.Book after book was taken down, shaken, and the binding
carefully scrutinised.Having cleared a shelf, she drew a tape measure
from her pocket and rapped and measured the back and sides of the case
itself.What on earth could she be looking for, wondered Cyril.For his cousin's will, executed at the date of his marriage, had
been found safely deposited with his solicitor.One in which she hoped that her master had remembered her, as he had
probably promised her that he would?Well, there was no further need of concealment, he decided, so, parting
the curtains, he stepped into the room.His own voice startled him, it rang out so loud and harsh in the silence
of the night.Valdriguez knelt on the floor with her back to him, and it seemed as if
the sudden shock had paralysed her, for she made no effort to move, and
her hand, arrested in the act of replacing a book, remained
outstretched, as if it had been turned to stone.He saw her shudder convulsively, then slowly she raised her head, and as
her great, tragic eyes met his, Cyril was conscious of a revulsion of
feeling toward her.Never had he seen anything so hopeless yet so
undaunted as the look she gave him.It reminded him, curiously enough,
of a look he had once seen in the eyes of a lioness, who, with a bullet
through her heart, still fought to protect her young.Staggering a little as she rose, Valdriguez nevertheless managed to draw
herself up to her full height."I am here, my lord, to get what is mine--mine," she repeated almost
fiercely.It was absurd, he reasoned, to allow
himself to be impressed by her strange personality.he exclaimed; and the very fact that he was more than
half-inclined to believe her, made him speak more roughly than he would
otherwise have done."Think what you like," she cried, shrugging her shoulders
contemptuously."Have me arrested--have me hung--what do I care?"So you confess that it was you who murdered his Lordship?Your sanctimonious airs didn't deceive me," exclaimed
Cyril triumphantly."No, I did not murder him," she replied calmly, almost indifferently."I think you will have some difficulty convincing the police of that.You have no alibi to prove that you were not in these rooms at the time
of the murder, and now when I tell them that I found you trying to
steal----"

"I am no thief," she interrupted him with blazing eyes."I tell you, I
came here to get what is mine by right.""Do you really expect me to believe that?Even if what you say were
true, you would not have had to sneak in here in the middle of the
night.You know very well that I should have made no objections to your
claiming your own."But if I had gone to you and told you that a great lord had
robbed me, a poor woman, of something which is dearer to me than life
itself, would you have believed me?If I had said to you, 'I must look
through his Lordship's papers; I must be free to search everywhere,'
would you have given me permission to do so?That it was because I was ashamed of my errand that I came here at
this hour?All I feared was that I should be prevented from
discovering the truth.Valdriguez's voice suddenly dropped
and she seemed to forget Cyril's presence.She
continued speaking as if to herself and her wild eyes swept feverishly
around the room."He told me it was here--and yet how can I be sure of
it?He may have lied to me about this as he did about everything else.I cannot bear it any
longer, oh, my God!"she cried, clasping her hands and lifting her
streaming eyes to heaven, "Thou knowest that I have striven all my life
to do Thy will; I have borne the cross that Thou sawest fit to lay upon
me without a murmur, nor have I once begged for mercy at Thy hands; but
now, now, oh, my Father, I beseech thee, give me to know the truth
before I die----"

Cyril watched the woman narrowly.He felt that he must try and maintain
a judicial attitude toward her and not allow himself to be led astray by
his sympathies which, as he knew to his cost, were only too easily
aroused.After all, he reasoned, was it not more than likely that she
was delivering this melodramatic tirade for his benefit?On the other
hand, it was against his principles as well as against his inclinations
to deal harshly with a woman."Calm yourself, Valdriguez," he said at last."If you can convince me
that his Lordship had in his possession something which rightfully
belonged to you, I promise that, if it can be found, it shall be
restored to you.Tell me, what it is that you are looking for?"You promise--so did he--the
smooth-tongued villain!Never
will I trust one of his race again.""You have got to trust me whether you want to or not.Your position
could not be worse than it is, could it?Don't you see that your only
hope lies in being able to persuade me that you are an honest woman?"For the first time Valdriguez looked at Cyril attentively.He felt as if
her great eyes were probing his very soul."Indeed, you do not look cruel or deceitful.And, as you say, I am
powerless without you, so I must take the risk of your being what you
seem.But first, my lord, will you swear not
to betray my secret to any living being?"That is--" he hastily added, "if it has
nothing to do with the murder."CHAPTER XVI

THE STORY OF A WRONG


Cyril waited for her to continue, but for a long time it seemed doubtful
if she would have the courage to do so."I am looking," she said at last, speaking slowly and with a visible
effort, "for a paper which will tell me whether my--son is alive or
dead."So you were his Lordship's mistress----"

"Before God I was his wife!"The old story--" began Cyril, but Valdriguez stopped him with a furious
gesture."Do not dare to say that my child's mother was a loose woman!Arthur Wilmersley--may his Maker judge him as he
deserves--wrecked my life, but at least he never doubted my virtue.He
knew that the only way to get me was to marry me.""No--but for a long time I believed that he had.How could a young,
innocent girl have suspected that the man she loved was capable of such
cold-blooded deception?Even now, I cannot blame myself for having
fallen into the trap he baited with such fiendish cunning.Think of
it--he induced me to consent to a secret marriage by promising that if I
made this sacrifice for his sake, he would become a convert to my
religion--my religion!And as we stood together before the altar, I
remember that I thanked God for giving me this opportunity of saving a
soul from destruction.I never dreamed that the church he took me to was
nothing but an old ruin he had fitted up as a chapel for the occasion.How could I guess that the man who married us was not a priest but a
mountebank, whom he had hired to act the part?"Valdriguez bowed her head and the tears trickled through her thin
fingers."I know that not many people would believe you but, well--I do."It
seemed to Cyril as if the words sprang to his lips unbidden."Then indeed you are a good man," exclaimed Valdriguez, "for it is given
only to honest people to have a sure ear for the truth.Now it will be
easier to tell you the rest.Some weeks after we had gone through this
ceremony, first Lord and then Lady Wilmersley died; on her deathbed I
confided to my lady that I was her son's wife and she gave me her
blessing.My humble birth she forgave--after all it was less humble than
her own--and was content that her son had chosen a girl of her own race
and faith.As soon as the funeral was over, I urged my husband to
announce our marriage, but he would not.He proposed that we should go
for a while to the continent so that on our return it would be taken for
granted that we had been married there, and in this way much unpleasant
talk avoided.So we went to Paris and there we lived together openly as
man and wife, not indeed under his name but under mine.He pretended
that he wanted for once to see the world from the standpoint of the
people; that he desired for a short time to be free from the
restrictions of his rank.I myself dreaded so much entering a class so
far above me that I was glad of the chance of spending a few more months
in obscurity.For some weeks I was happy, then Lord Wilmersley began to
show himself to me as he really was.We had taken a large apartment near
the Luxembourg, and soon it became the meeting-ground for the most
reckless element of the Latin Quarter.Ah, if you but knew what sights I
saw, what things I heard in those days!I feared that my very soul was
being polluted, so I consulted a priest as to what I should do.He told
me it was my duty to remain constantly at my husband's side; with prayer
and patience I might some day succeed in reforming him.So I stayed in
that hell and bore the insults and humiliations he heaped upon me
without a murmur.Now, looking back on the past, I think my meekness and
resignation only exasperated him, for he grew more and more cruel and
seemed to think of nothing but how to torture me into revolt.Whether I
should have been given the strength to endure indefinitely, the life he
led me I do not know, but one evening, when we were as usual
entertaining a disreputable rabble, a young man entered.He was dressed in a
brown velveteen suit; a red sash encircled his waist; and on his arm he
flaunted a painted woman.I stood up and turned to
my husband.I could not speak--and he, the man I had loved, only
laughed--laughed!Never shall I forget the sound of that laughter....

"That night my child was born.That was twenty-eight years ago, but it
seems as if it were but yesterday that I held his small, warm body in my
arms.... Then comes a period of which I remember nothing, and when I
finally recovered my senses, they told me my child was dead.... As soon
as I was able to travel, I returned to my old home in Seville and there
I lived, working and praying--praying for my own soul and for that of my
poor baby, who had died without receiving the sacrament of baptism....
Years passed.I had become resigned to my lot, when one day I received a
letter from Lord Wilmersley.If I had only destroyed it unopened,
how much anguish would have been spared me!But at first when I read it,
I thought my happiness would have killed me, for Lord Wilmersley wrote
that my boy was not dead and that if I would meet him in Paris, he would
give me further news of him.At once did I set
out on my journey.On arriving in Paris I went to the hotel he had
indicated and was shown into a private _salon_.There for the first time
in a quarter of a century I saw again the man I had once regarded as my
husband.At first I had difficulty in recognising him, for now his true
character was written in every line of his face and figure.But I hardly
gave a thought either to him or to my wrongs, so great was my impatience
to hear news of my son.... Then that fiend began to play with me as a
cat with a mouse.Yes, my boy lived, had made his way in the world--that
was all he would tell me.My child had been adopted by some well-to-do
people, who had brought him up as their own--no, I needn't expect to
hear another word.Yes, he was a fine, strong lad--he would say no
more.... Can you imagine the scene?Finally, having wrought me up to the
point where I would have done anything to wring the truth from him, he
said to me: 'I have recently married a young wife and I am not such a
fool as to trust my honour in the keeping of a girl who married an old
man like me for his money.Now I have a plan to propose to you.Come and
live with her as her maid and help me to guard her from all eyes, and if
you fulfil your duties faithfully, at the end of three years I promise
that you shall see your son.'"His revolting proposition made my blood boil.Never, never, I told him,
would I accept such a humiliating situation.He merely shrugged his
shoulders and said that in that case I need never hope to hear what had
become of my son.I raved, threatened, pleaded, but he remained
inflexible, and finally I agreed to do his bidding.""So you, who call yourself a Christian, actually consented to help that
wretch to persecute his unfortunate young wife?"Valdriguez flung her head back defiantly.Besides, had she not taken him for better
or worse?Why should I have helped her to break the bonds her own vows
had imposed on her?He did not ill-treat her, far from it.He deprived
her of her liberty, but what of that?A nun has even less freedom than
she had.Think of it, day
after day I had to stand aside and watch the man I had once looked upon
as my husband, lavish his love, his thought, his very life indeed, on
that pretty doll.Although I no longer loved him, my flesh quivered at
the sight.""My lord, I care not for your judgment nor for that of any man.Would you have had me give up that sacred task
because a pink and white baby wanted to flaunt her beauty before the
world?Lady Wilmersley's fate troubles me not at all; but what
breaks my heart is that, as Arthur died just before the three years were
up, I fear that now I shall never know what has become of my boy.Sometimes I have feared that he is dead--but no, I will not believe it!"And in this
room--perhaps within reach of my hand as I stand here--is the paper
which would tell me where he is.Ah, my lord, I beg, I entreat you to
help me to find it!""I will gladly do so, but what reason have you for supposing that there
is such a paper?""It is true that I have only Lord Wilmersley's word for it," she
replied, and her voice sounded suddenly hopeless."Yet not once but many
times he said to me: 'I have a paper in which is written all you wish to
know, but as I do not trust you, I have hidden it, yes, in this very
room have I hidden it.'And now he is dead and I cannot find it!"Even if we cannot find the paper, there are other means of tracing your
son.We will advertise----"

"Never!""I will never consent to do
anything which might reveal to him the secret of his birth.I would long
ago have taken steps to find him, if I had not realised that I could not
do so without taking a number of people into my confidence, and, if I
did that, the story of my shame would be bound to leak out.Not for
myself did I care, but for him.Think of it, if what Lord Wilmersley
told me was true, he holds an honourable position, believes himself the
son of respectable parents.Would it not be horrible, if he should
suddenly learn that he is the nameless child of a servant girl and a
villain?The fear that he should somehow discover the truth is always
before me.That is why I made you swear to keep my secret.""Of course, I will do as you wish, but I assure you that you exaggerate
the risk.Still, let us first search this room thoroughly; then, if we
do not find the paper, it will be time enough to decide what we shall do
next.""Ah, my lord, you are very good to me and may God reward you as you
deserve.And to Cyril's dismay,
Valdriguez suddenly bent down and covered his hands with kisses.CHAPTER XVII

GUY RELENTS


Cyril and Valdriguez spent the next morning making a thorough search of
the library, but the paper they were looking for could not be found.Cyril had from the first been sceptical of success.He could not believe
that her child was still alive and was convinced that Arthur Wilmersley
had fabricated the story simply to retain his hold over the unfortunate
mother.Valdriguez, however, for a long time refused to abandon the
quest.Again and again she ransacked places they had already carefully
examined.When it was finally borne in upon her that there was no
further possibility of finding what she so sought, the light suddenly
went out of her face and she would have fallen if Cyril had not caught
her and placed her in a chair.With arms hanging limply to her sides,
her half-closed eyes fixed vacantly in front of her, she looked as if
death had laid his hand upon her.Thoroughly alarmed, Cyril had the
woman carried to her room and sent for a doctor.When the latter
arrived, he shook his head hopelessly.She had had a stroke; there was
very little he could do for her.In his opinion it was extremely
doubtful if she would ever fully recover her faculties, he said.Cyril having made every possible arrangement for the comfort of the
afflicted woman, at last allowed his thoughts to revert to his own
troubles.He realised that with the elimination of both Valdriguez and Prentice
there was no one but Anita left who could reasonably be suspected of the
murder; for that the two Frenchmen were implicated in the affair, was
too remote a possibility to be seriously considered.No, he must make up
his mind to face the facts: the girl was Anita Wilmersley and she had
killed her husband!What was he going to do, now that he knew the truth?Judson's advice that Anita should give herself up, he rejected without a
moment's hesitation.Yet, he had to acknowledge that there was little
hope of her being able to escape detection, as long as the police knew
her to be alive.... Suddenly an idea occurred to him.If they could only
be made to believe that she was dead, that and that alone would free her
at once and forever from their surveillance.She would be able to leave
England; to resume her life in some distant country where he.... Cyril
shrank instinctively from pursuing the delicious dream further.He tried
to force himself to consider judicially the scheme that was shaping
itself in his mind; to weigh calmly and dispassionately the chances for
and against its success.If a corpse resembling Anita were found,
dressed in the clothes she wore the day she left Geralton, it would
surely be taken for granted that the body was hers and that she had been
murdered.But how on earth was he to procure such a corpse and, having
procured it, where was he to hide it?The neighbourhood of the castle
had been so thoroughly searched that it would be no easy task to
persuade the police that they had overlooked any spot where a body might
be secreted.Certainly the plan presented almost insurmountable
difficulties, but as it was the only one he could think of, Cyril clung
to it with bull-dog tenacity.Impossible is but a word
designed to shield the incompetent or frighten the timid," he muttered
loudly in his heart, unconsciously squaring his broad shoulders.He decided to leave Geralton at once, for the plan must be carried out
immediately or not at all, and it was only in London that he could hope
to procure the necessary assistance.On arriving in town, however, Cyril had to admit that he had really no
idea what he ought to do next.If he could only get in touch with an
impoverished medical student who would agree to provide a body, the
first and most difficult part of his undertaking would be achieved.But
how and where was he to find this indispensable accomplice?Well, it was
too late to do anything that evening, he decided.He might as well go to
the club and get some dinner and try to dismiss the problem from his
mind for the time being.The first person he saw on entering the dining-room was Campbell.He was
sitting by himself at a small table; his round, rosy face depicted the
utmost dejection and he thrust his fork through an oyster with much the
same expression a man might have worn who was spearing a personal enemy.On catching sight of Cyril, he dropped his fork, jumped from his seat,
and made an eager step forward.Then, he suddenly wavered, evidently
uncertain as to the reception Cyril was going to accord him."Well, this is a piece of luck!"cried Cyril, stretching out his hand.Guy, looking decidedly sheepish, clasped it eagerly."I might as well tell you at once that I know I made no end of an ass of
myself the other day," he said, averting his eyes from his friend's
face."It is really pretty decent of you not to have resented my
ridiculous accusations.""Oh, that's all right," Cyril assured him, "I quite understood your
motive.But I am awfully glad you have changed your attitude towards me,
for to tell you the truth, I am in great need of your assistance."ejaculated Campbell, screwing up his face into an expression
of comic despair.As soon as there was no danger of their being overheard, Cyril told
Campbell of his interview with Judson.At first Guy could not be
persuaded that the girl was Anita Wilmersley."She is not a liar, I am sure of it!If she said that her hair had
turned white, it had turned white, and therefore it is impossible that
she had dyed it," objected Campbell."Judson suggested that she dyed only part of her hair and that it was
the rest which turned white."Having finally convinced Guy that there was no doubt as to the girl's
identity, Cyril proceeded to unfold his plan for rescuing her from the
police.Guy adjusted his eye-glass and stared at his friend speechless with
consternation."This affair has turned your brain," he finally gasped."Your plan is
absurd, absolutely absurd, I tell you.Why, even if I could bribe some
one to procure me a corpse, how on earth could you get it to Geralton?""And where under Heaven are you to hide it?""Get me a corpse and I will arrange the rest," Cyril assured him with
more confidence than he really felt."First you saddle me with a lot of stolen jewels and now you want me to
travel around the country with a corpse under my arm!I say, you do
select nice, pleasant jobs for me!""Can't say I have," acknowledged Guy."Are you willing to sit still and see Anita Wilmersley arrested?""Certainly not, but your scheme is a mad one--madder than anything I
should have credited even you with having conceived."Campbell paused a
moment as if considering the question in all its aspects."However, the
fact that it is crazy may save us.The police will not be likely to
suspect two reputable members of society, whose sanity has so far not
been doubted, of attempting to carry through such a wild, impossible
plot.Yes," he mused, "the very impossibility of the thing may make it
possible.""Glad you agree with me," cried Cyril enthusiastically."Now how soon
can you get a corpse, do you think?"You talk as if I could order one from Whiteley's.When
can I get you a corpse--indeed?To-morrow--in a week--a month--a
year--never.The last-mentioned date I consider the most likely.I will
do what I can, that is all I can say; but how I am to go to work, upon
my word, I haven't the faintest idea.""You are an awfully clever chap, Guy."I am the absolute fool, but I am
still sane enough to know it.""Very well, I'll acknowledge that you are a fool and I only wish there
were more like you," said Cyril, clapping his friend affectionately on
the back."By the way," he added, turning away as if in search of a match and
trying to speak as carelessly as possible, "How is Anita?"For a moment Guy did not answer and Cyril stood fumbling with the
matches fearful of the effect of the question.He was still doubtful how
far his friend had receded from his former position and was much
relieved when Guy finally answered in a very subdued voice:

"She is pretty well--but--" He hesitated.He noticed that Guy's face had lengthened
perceptibly and that he toyed nervously with his eye-glass."The fact is," replied Campbell, speaking slowly and carefully avoiding
the other's eye, "I think it is possible that she misses you."Cyril's heart gave a sudden jump."I can hardly believe it," he managed to stutter."Of course, Miss Trevor may be mistaken.It was her idea, not mine, that
Ani--Lady Wilmersley I mean--is worrying over your absence.But whatever
the cause, the fact remains that she has changed very much.She is no
longer frank and cordial in her manner either to Miss Trevor or myself.It seems almost as if she regarded us both with suspicion, though what
she can possibly suspect us of, I can't for the life of me imagine.That
day at lunch she was gay as a child, but now she is never anything but
sad and preoccupied.""Perhaps she is beginning to remember the past," suggested Cyril.Miss Trevor and I have tried everything we could think
of to induce her to confide in us, but she won't.Possibly you might be
more successful--" An involuntary sigh escaped Campbell."I am sorry now
that I prevented you from seeing her.Mind you, I still think it wiser
not to do so, but I ought to have left you free to use your own
judgment.The number of her sitting-room is 62, on the second floor and,
for some reason or other, she insists on being left there alone every
afternoon from three to four.Now I have told you all I know of the
situation and you must handle it as you think best."CHAPTER XVIII

A SLIP OF THE TONGUE


Cyril spent the night in a state of pitiable indecision.Should he or
should he not risk a visit to Anita?If the police were shadowing him,
it would be fatal, but he had somehow lately acquired the conviction
that they were not.On the other hand, if he could only see her, how it
would simplify everything!As she distrusted both Guy and Miss Trevor,
even if his plot succeeded, she would probably refuse to leave England
unless he himself told her that he wished her to do so.Besides, there
were so many details to be discussed, so many arrangements to be talked
over."Yes," he said to himself as he lay staring into the darkness, "it
is my duty to see her.I shall go to her not because I want to...." A
horrid doubt made him pause.Was he so sure that his decision was not
the outcome of his own desire?How could he trust his judgment in a
matter where his inclinations were so deeply involved?Yet it would be
shocking if he allowed his own feelings to induce him to do something
which might be injurious to Anita.It was a nice question to determine
whether her need of him was sufficient to justify him in risking a
visit?For hours he debated with himself but could arrive at no
conclusion.No sooner did he resolve to stay away from her than the
thought of her unhappiness again made him waver.If he only knew why she
was so unhappy, he told himself that the situation would not be so
unendurable.When he had talked to her over the telephone, she had
seemed cheerful; she had spoken of Guy and Miss Trevor with enthusiasm.What could have occurred since then to make her distrust them and to
plunge her into such a state of gloom?As he tossed to and fro on his
hot, tumbled bed, his imagination pictured one dire possibility after
another, till at last he made up his mind that he could bear the
uncertainty no longer.Having reached this decision, Cyril could hardly refrain from rushing
off to her as soon as it was light.However, he had to curb his
impatience.Three o'clock was the only hour he could be sure of finding
her alone; so he must wait till three o'clock.But how on earth, he
asked himself, was he going to get through the intervening time?He was
in a state of feverish restlessness that was almost agony; he could not
apply himself to anything; he could only wait--wait.Although he knew
that there was no chance of his meeting Anita, he haunted the
neighbourhood of the "George" all the morning.Every few minutes he
consulted his watch and the progress of the hands seemed to him so
incredibly slow that more than once he thought that it must have stopped
altogether.Flinging back his shoulders and assuming a carelessness that almost
amounted to a swagger, Cyril entered the hotel.He was so self-conscious
that it was with considerable surprise as well as relief that he noticed
that no one paid the slightest attention to him.Even the porter hardly
glanced at him, being at the moment engaged in speeding a parting guest.Cyril decided to use the stairs in preference to the lift, as they were
less frequented than the latter, and as it happened, he made his way up
to the second landing without encountering anybody.There, however, he came face to face with a pretty housemaid, who to his
dismay looked at him attentively.Had he but
known it, she had been attracted by his tall, soldierly figure and had
merely offered him the tribute of an admiring glance.But this
explanation never occurred to our modest hero and he hurried, quite
absurdly flustered by this trifling incident.62
opened on a small, ill-lighted hall, which was for the moment completely
deserted.Now that he actually stood on the threshold of Anita's room, Cyril felt
a curious reluctance to proceed farther.It was unwise.... She might not
want to see him.... But even as these objections flashed through his
mind, he knocked almost involuntarily.His heart was beating like a sledge-hammer and
his hands were trembling.Never had he experienced such a curious
sensation before and he wondered vaguely what could be the matter with
him."I can't stand here forever," he said in his heart."I wanted to see
her; well then, why don't I open the door?Still reasoning with himself, he finally entered the room.A bright fire was burning on the hearth and before it were heaped a
number of cushions and from this lowly seat Anita had apparently hastily
arisen.The length of time he had taken to answer her summons had
evidently alarmed her, for she stood like a creature at bay, her eyes
wide open and frightened.On recognising Cyril a deep blush suffused her
face and even coloured the whiteness of her throat.Her relief was obvious, yet her manner was distant, almost repellent.Cyril had confidently anticipated such a different reception that her
unexpected coldness completed his discomfiture.He felt as if the
foundations of his world were giving away beneath his feet.He managed,
however, to murmur something, he knew not what.The pounding of his
heart prevented him from thinking coherently.When his emotion had
subsided sufficiently for him to realise what he was doing, he found
himself sitting stiffly on one side of the fire with Anita sitting
equally stiffly on the other.She was talking--no, rather she was
engaging him in polite conversation.How long she had been doing so he
did not know, but he gathered that it could not have been long, as she
was still on the subject of the weather.I hope you had better luck in the
country.To-day has been especially disagreeable," she was saying.Cyril abused the weather with a vigour which was rather surprising, in
view of the fact that till she had mentioned it, he had been sublimely
unconscious whether the sun had been shining or not.But finally even
that prolific topic was exhausted and as no other apparently suggested
itself to either, they relapsed into a constrained silence.He had so longed to see her, and now an
impalpable barrier had somehow arisen between them which separated them
more completely than mere bricks and mortar, than any distance could
have done.True, he could feast his eyes on her cameo-like profile; on
the soft curve of her cheek; on the long, golden-tipped lashes; on the
slender, white throat, which rose like a column from the laces of her
dress.But he dared not look at her too long.Cyril was not
introspective and was only dimly aware of the cause of the turmoil which
was raging in his heart.He did not know that he averted his eyes for
fear that the primitive male within him would break loose from the
fetters of his will and forcibly seize the small creature so temptingly
within his reach."If I only knew what I have done to displease her!"He longed to question her, but she held herself so rigidly aloof that he
had not the courage to do so.It was in vain that he told himself that
her coldness simplified the situation; that it would have been terrible
to have had to repel her advances; but he could find no consolation in
the thought.In speechless misery he sat gazing into the fire.Suddenly he thrilled with the consciousness that she was looking at him.The glance they exchanged was of the briefest duration, but it sufficed
to lift the weight which had been crushing him.The corners of her mouth quivered slightly, but she did not answer."If I have," he continued, "I assure you it was quite unintentionally.Why, I would give my life to save you a moment's pain.Can't you feel
that I am speaking the truth?"She turned her face towards him, and as he looked at her, Cyril realised
that it was not only her manner which had altered; she herself had
mysteriously altered.At first he could not define wherein the
difference lay, but suddenly it flashed upon him.It was the expression
of her eyes which had changed.Heretofore he had been confident that
they reflected her every emotion; but now they were inscrutable.It was
as if she had drawn a veil over her soul."I don't know what you mean," she said.There was more than a hint of
hostility in her voice.If my visit is
distasteful to you, you have only to say so and I will go."As she did not immediately answer, he added:

"Perhaps I had better go."His tone, however, somehow implied more of a
threat than a suggestion; for since they had exchanged that fleeting
glance Cyril had felt unreasonably reassured.Despite her coldness, the
memory of her tender entreaties for his speedy return, buoyed up his
conceit.She could not be as indifferent to him as she seemed, he argued
to himself.However, as the moments passed and she offered no objection
to his leaving her, his newly-aroused confidence evaporated.But he made
no motion to do so; he could not."I can't leave her till I know how I have offended her.... There are so
many arrangements to be made.... I must get in touch with her again,--"
were some of the excuses with which he tried to convince himself that he
had a right to linger.He tried to read her face, but she had averted her head till he could
see nothing but one small, pink ear, peeping from beneath her curls."It is a little difficult to know how you wish to be treated!"Her
manner was icy, but his relief was so intense that he scarcely noticed
it."She is piqued, that
is the whole trouble."He felt a man once more, master of the situation."She probably expected me to--" He shrank from pursuing the thought any
further as the hot blood surged to his face.He was again conscious of
his helplessness."I suppose you
think me cold and unfeeling?She seemed startled by his vehemence, for she looked up at him timidly."Won't you tell me what has come
between us?"Right and wrong ceased to exist for
him.He forgot everything; stooping forward he gathered her into his
arms and crushed her small body against his heart.She thrust him from her with unexpected force and stood before him with
blazing eyes."You cannot treat me like a child, who can be neglected one day and
fondled the next!At the nursing home I was too weak
and confused to realise how strangely you were behaving, but now I know.You dare to complain of my coldness--my coldness indeed!Is my coldness
a match to yours?"If you do, then your conduct is all the more inexplicable.If you do,
then I ask you, what is it, who is it, that stands between us?""If I could tell you, don't you suppose I would?""Then there is some one, some person who is keeping us apart!""Ah, you see, you can't deny it!He hardly knew what he was saying; the words seemed to have leaped to
his lips.She regarded him for a second in silence evidently only partially
convinced.He had momentarily forgotten his wife, and
although he tried to convince himself that he had spoken the truth and
that it was not she who was keeping them apart, yet he had to
acknowledge that if he had been free, he would certainly have behaved
very differently towards Anita.So in a sense he had lied to her and as
he realised this, his eyes sank before hers.She did not fail to note
his embarrassment and pressed her point inexorably."Swear that there is no other woman who has a claim on you and I will
believe you."He could not lie to her in cold blood.Yet to tell her the truth was
also out of the question, he said to himself.While he still hesitated, she continued more vehemently."I don't ask you to tell me anything of your past or my past, if you had
rather not do so.One thing, however, I must and will know--who is this
woman and what are her pretensions?""I--I cannot tell you," he said at last.Some day,
I promise you, you shall know everything, but now it is impossible.But
this much I will say--I love you as I have never loved any one in my
whole life."She trembled from head to foot and half closed her eyes.Cyril felt that this very silence
established a communion between them, more complete, more intense than
any words could have done.But as he gazed at the small, drooping
figure, he felt that his self-control was deserting him completely.He
almost reeled with the violence of his emotion."I can't stand it another moment," he said to himself."I must go
before--" He did not finish the sentence but clenched his hands till the
knuckles showed white through the skin.I can't tell you
what I feel.He murmured incoherently and seizing her hands,
he pressed them for an instant against his lips, then dropping them
abruptly, he fled from the room.Cyril in his excitement had not noticed that he had called Anita by her
name nor did he perceive the start she gave when she heard it.After the
door had clicked behind him, she sat as if turned to stone, white to her
very lips.Slowly, as if with an effort, her lips moved.she repeated over and over
again as if she were trying to learn a difficult lesson.But the tension had been too great; with a little gasp she sank fainting
to the floor.CHAPTER XIX

AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR


What he did during the next few hours, Cyril never quite knew.He
retained a vague impression of wandering through endless streets and of
being now and then arrested in his heedless course by the angry
imprecations of some wayfarer he had inadvertently jostled or of some
Jehu whose progress he was blocking.How could he have behaved like such a fool, he kept asking himself.He
had not said a thing to Anita that he had meant to say--not one.Worse
still, he had told her that he loved her!He had even held her in his
arms!Cyril tried not to exult at the thought.He told himself again and
again that he had acted like a cad; nevertheless the memory of that
moment filled him with triumphant rapture.Had he lost all sense of
shame, he wondered.He tried to consider Anita's situation, his own
situation; but he could not.He could think
neither of the past nor of the future; he could think of nothing
connectedly.The daylight waned and still he tramped steadily onward.Finally,
however, his body began to assert itself.His footsteps grew gradually
slower, till at last he realised that he was miles from home and that he
was completely exhausted.Hailing a passing conveyance, he drove to his
lodgings.He was still so engrossed in his dreams that he felt no surprise at
finding Peter sitting in the front hall, nor did he notice the dejected
droop of the latter's shoulders.On catching sight of his master, Peter sprang forward.My lord," he whispered with his finger on his lip; and turning
slightly, he cast an apprehensive glance over his shoulder towards the
top of the stairs.With an effort Cyril shook off his preoccupation.Following the
direction of his servant's eyes, he saw nothing more alarming than a few
dusty plants which were supposed to adorn the small landing where the
stairs turned.Before he had time to form a conjecture as to the cause
of Peter's agitation, the latter continued breathlessly: "Her Ladyship
'ave arrived, my lord!"Having made this announcement, he stepped back as if to watch what
effect this information would have on his master.There was no doubt
that Peter's alarm was very genuine, yet one felt that in spite of it he
was enjoying the dramatic possibilities of the situation.Cyril, however, only blinked at him uncomprehendingly."Lady Wilmersley, my lord, and she brought her baggage.I haven't known
what to do, that I haven't.I knew she ought not to stay here, but I
couldn't turn 'er out, could I?"Cyril's mind was so full of Anita that he never doubted that it was she
to whom Peter was referring, so without waiting to ask further
questions, he rushed upstairs two steps at a time, and threw open the
door of his sitting-room.On a low chair in front of the fire his wife sat reading quietly.Cyril staggered back as if he had been struck.She, however, only turned
her head languidly and closing her book, surveyed him with a mocking
smile.His disappointment added fuel to his
indignation.She seemed in nowise affected by his anger; only her expression became,
if possible, a trifle more contemptuous."Your manners have sadly deteriorated since we parted," she remarked,
raising her eyebrows superciliously.he exclaimed and his voice actually shook with rage."May I
ask how you expected to be received?Is it possible that you imagine
that I am going to take you back?"Her eyes narrowed, but she still appeared quite unconcerned."Do you know, I rather think you will," she drawled."Take you back, now that you have tired of your lover or he has become
disgusted with you, which is probably nearer the truth.Do you think I
am mad, or are you?"He fancied that he saw her wince, but she replied calmly:

"Do not let us indulge in mutual recriminations.What have you to reproach
me with?Didn't I marry you to save you from disgrace and penury?Haven't I done everything I could to keep you straight?"She rose slowly from her seat and he noticed for the first time that she
wore a low-cut gown of some diaphanous material, which revealed and yet
softened the too delicate lines of her sinuous figure.Her black hair
lay in thick waves around her face, completely covering the ears, and
wound in a coil at the back of her neck.He had never seen it arranged
in this fashion and reluctantly he had to admit that it was strangely
becoming to her.A wide band of dull gold, set with uncut gems,
encircled her head and added a barbaric note to her exotic beauty.It
was his last gift to her, he remembered.Yes, she was still beautiful, he acknowledged, although the life she had
led, had left its marks upon her.She looked older and frailer than when
he had seen her last.But to-night the sunken eyes glowed with
extraordinary brilliancy and a soft colour gave a certain roundness to
her hollow cheeks.As she stood before him, Cyril was conscious, for the
first time in years, of the alluring charm of her personality.She regarded him for a moment, her full red lips parted in an
inscrutable smile.In some mysterious way it suggested infinite
possibilities."You tried everything, I grant you," she said at last, "except the one
thing which would have proved efficacious."Yes, it was true, he
acknowledged to himself.Had he not realised it during the last few days
as he had never done before?"You don't even take the trouble to deny it," she continued."You
married me out of pity and instead of being ashamed of it, you actually
pride yourself on the purity of your motive.""Well, at any rate I can't see what there was to be ashamed of," he
replied indignantly.Oh, how you good people exasperate me!You seem to
lack all comprehension of the natural cravings of a normal human being."It was not my fault that I could not love you.""No, but knowing that you did not love me, it was dastardly of you to
have married me without telling me the truth.In doing so, you took from
me my objective in life--you destroyed my ideals.Oh, don't look so
sceptical, you fool!Can't you see that I should never have remained a
governess until I was twenty-five, if I had not had ideals?It was
because I had such lofty conceptions of love that I kept myself
scrupulously aloof from men, so that I might come to my mate, when I
found him, with soul, mind, and body unsullied."She spoke with such passionate sincerity that it was with an effort
Cyril reminded himself that her past had not been as blameless as she
pictured it."Your fine ideals did not prevent you from becoming a drunkard--" he
remarked drily."When I married, I was not a drunkard," she vehemently protested."The
existence I led was abhorrent to me, and it is true that occasionally
when I felt I could not stand it another moment, I would go to my room
after dinner and get what comfort I could out of alcohol; but what I
did, I did deliberately and not to satisfy an ungovernable appetite.I
was no more a drunkard than a woman who takes a dose of morphine during
bodily agony is a drug fiend.Of course, my conduct seems inexcusable to
you, for you are quite incapable of understanding the torture my life
was to me.""Other women have suffered far greater misfortunes and have borne them
with fortitude and dignity.""Look at me, Cyril; even now am I like other women?""Was it my fault that I was born with beauty that demanded its
due?Was I to blame that my blood leaped wildly through my veins, that
my imagination was always on fire?But I was, and still am,
instinctively and fundamentally a virtuous woman.Oh, you may sneer, but
it is true!Although as a girl I was starving for love, I never accepted
passion as a substitute, and you can't realise how incessantly the
latter was offered me.Wherever I went, I was persecuted by it.At times
I had a horrible fear that desire was all that I was capable of evoking;
and when you came to me in my misery, poverty, and disgrace, I hailed
you as my king--my man!I believed that you were offering me a love so
great that it welcomed the sacrifice of every minor consideration.It
never occurred to me that you would dare to ask me for myself, my life,
my future, unless you were able to give me in exchange something more
than the mere luxuries of existence.""I also offered you my life----"

"You did not!""You offered up your life, not to
me, but to your own miserable conception of chivalry.The greatness of
your sacrifice intoxicated you and consequently it seemed to you
inevitable that I also would spend the rest of my days in humble
contemplation of your sublime character?""Such an idea never occurred to me," Cyril angrily objected."Oh, you never formulated it in so many words, I know that!You are too
self-conscious to be introspective and are actually proud of the fact
that you never stop to analyse either yourself or your motives.So you
go blundering through life without in the least realising what are the
influences which shape your actions.You fancy that you are not
self-centred because you are too shy, yes, and too vain to probe the
hidden recesses of your heart.You imagine that you are unselfish
because you make daily sacrifices to your own ideal of conduct.But of
that utter forgetfulness of self, of that complete merging and
submerging of your identity in another's, you have never had even the
vaguest conception.When you married me, it never occurred to you that I
had the right to demand both love and comprehension.You, the idealist,
expected me to be satisfied with the material advantages you offered;
but I, the degraded creature you take me to be, had I known the truth,
would never have consented to sell my birthright for a mess of pottage.""That sounds all very fine, and I confess I may not have been a perfect
husband, but after all, what would you have done, I should like to know,
if I had not married you?"I would have worked and hoped, and if work had failed me, I would
have begged and hoped.I would even have starved, before abandoning the
hope that some day I should find the man who was destined for me.When I
at last realised that you did not love me, you cannot imagine my
despair.I consumed myself in futile efforts to please you, but the very
intensity of my love prevented me from exercising those arts and
artifices which might have brought you to my feet.My emotion in your
presence was so great that it sealed my lips and made you find me a dull
companion."You know very well that it was not that which
alienated me from you.When I married you, I may not have been what is
called in love with you, but I was certainly fond of you, and if you had
behaved yourself, I should no doubt in time have become more closely
united to you.You talk of 'consuming' yourself to please me.But you chose a
strange means of gaining my affections when you took to disgracing
yourself both privately and publicly."The passionate resentment which had transfigured her slowly faded from
Amy's face, leaving it drawn and old; her voice, when she spoke, sounded
infinitely weary."When I knew for a certainty that a lukewarm affection was all you would
ever feel for me, I lost hope, and in losing hope, I lost my foothold on
life.I wanted to die--I determined to die.Time and time again, I
pressed your pistol to my forehead, but something stronger than my will
always prevented me from pulling the trigger; and finally I sought
forgetfulness in drink, because I had not the courage to find it in
death.At first I tried to hide my condition from you, but there came a
moment when the sight of your bland self-satisfaction became unbearable,
when your absolute unconsciousness of the havoc you had made of my life
maddened me.Oh, not as I had suffered, you are
not capable of that; but at any rate I could hurt your vanity and deal a
death-blow to your pride!You had disgraced me when you tricked me into
giving myself to a man who did not love me; I determined to disgrace you
by reeling through the public streets.she cried
with indescribable bitterness."When I saw you grow pale with anger,
when I saw you tremble with shame, I suppose you fancy that I must, at
times, have suffered from remorse and humiliation?I swear that never
for a moment have I regretted the course I chose.I am ashamed of
nothing except that I lacked the courage to kill myself.How I welcomed the gradual deadening of my senses, the dulling of my
fevered brain!When I awoke from my long torpor and found myself at
Charleroi, I cursed the doctor who had brought me back to life.The thought of you haunted me day and
night, while a raging thirst racked my body, and from this twofold
torture the constant supervision of the nurses prevented me from
obtaining even a temporary respite.For a moment Cyril felt a wave of pity sweep over him, but suddenly he
stiffened."You forget to mention that--consolation was offered you."Had I found that, I should not be here!I admit, however,
that when I first noticed that M. de Brissac was attracted by me, I was
mildly pleased.It was a solace to my wounded vanity to find that some
one still found me desirable.But I swear that it never even occurred to
me to give myself to him, till the doctor told me that you were coming
to take me away with you.Subject myself anew to your
indifference--your contempt?So I took the only means of escaping
from you which offered itself.And I am glad, glad that I flung myself
into the mire, for by defiling love, I killed it.I am at last free from
the obsession which has been the torment of my life.Neither you nor any
other man will again fire my imagination or stir my senses.I am dead,
but I am also free--free!"As she spoke the last words her expression was so exalted that Cyril was
forced to grant her his grudging admiration.As she stood before him,
she seemed more a spirit than a woman; she seemed the incarnation of
life, of love, of the very fundamentals of existence.She was really an
extraordinary woman; why did he not love her, he asked himself.But even
as this flashed through his mind the memory of his long martyrdom
obtruded itself.He saw her again not as she appeared then, but as the
central figure in a succession of loathsome scenes."Your attempt to justify yourself may impose on others, but not on me.What you term love is
nothing but an abnormal craving, which no healthy-minded man with his
work in life to do could have possibly satisfied.Our code, however, is
too different for me to discuss the matter with you.And so, if you have
quite finished expatiating on my shortcomings, would you kindly tell me
to what I owe the honour of your visit?"She turned abruptly from him and leaned for a minute against the
mantelpiece; then, sinking into a chair, she took a cigarette from a box
which lay on the table near her and proceeded to light it with apparent
unconcern.Cyril, however, noticed that her hand trembled violently.After inhaling a few puffs, she threw her head back and looked at him
tauntingly from between her narrowed lids."Because, my dear Cyril, I read in yesterday's paper that your wife had
been your companion on your ill-timed journey from Paris.So I thought
it would be rather amusing to run over and find out a few particulars as
to the young person who is masquerading under my name."She had caught Cyril completely off his guard and he felt for a moment
incapable of parrying her attack."I assure you," he stuttered, "it is all a mistake--" He hesitated; he
could think of no explanation which would satisfy her."I expected you to tell me that she was as pure as snow!""But how you with your puritanic ideas managed to
get yourself into such an imbroglio passes my understanding.Really, I
consider that you owe it to me, to satisfy my curiosity.""I regret that I am unable to do so."Still, as I shall no doubt solve the riddle in a few days, I
can possess my soul in patience.Meanwhile I shall enjoy watching your
efforts to prevent me from learning the truth.""Unfortunately for you, that pleasure will be denied you.You are going
to leave this house at once and we shall not meet again till we do so
before judge and jury.""So you will persist in trying to bluff it out?Don't you
realise that I hold all the cards and that I am quite clever enough to
use them to the best advantage?You see, knowing you as I do, I am
convinced that the motive which led you to sacrifice both truth and
honour is probably as praiseworthy as it is absurd.But having made such
a sacrifice, why are you determined to render it useless?I cannot
believe that you are willing to face the loss not only of your own
reputation but of that of the young person who has accepted your
protection.How do you fancy she would enjoy figuring as corespondent in
a divorce suit?"Cyril felt as if he were caught in a trap."My God," he cried, "you wouldn't do that!I swear to you that she is
absolutely innocent.She was in a terrible situation and to say that she
was my wife seemed the only way to save her.She doesn't even know I am
married!"And have you never considered that when she finds out the
truth, she may fail to appreciate the delicacy which no doubt prevented
you from mentioning the trifling fact of my existence?It is rather
funny that your attempts to rescue forlorn damsels seem doomed to be
unsuccessful!Or were your motives in this case not quite so impersonal
as I fancied?Has Launcelot at last found his Guinevere?If so, I may
yet be avenged vicariously.""Your presence is punishment enough, I assure you, for all the sins I
ever committed!What exactly is it that you are
threatening me with?"If neither you nor this woman object to its
being known that you travelled together as man and wife, then I am
powerless.""But you have just acknowledged that you know that our relation is a
harmless one," cried Cyril."I do not know it--but--yes, I believe it.Do you think, however, that
any one else will do so?""Surely you would not be such a fiend as to wreck the life of an
innocent young girl?""If her life is wrecked, whose fault is it?It
was you who by publicly proclaiming her to be your wife, made it
impossible for her disgrace to remain a secret.Don't you realise that
even if I took no steps in the matter, sooner or later the truth is
bound to be discovered?Now I--and I alone--can save you from the
consequences of your folly.If you will agree not to divorce me, I
promise not only to keep your secret, but to protect the good name of
this woman by every means in my power.""I should like to know what you expect to gain by trying to force me to
take you back?Is it the title that you covet, or do you long to shine
in society?But remember that in order to do that, you would have
radically to reform your habits.""I have no intention of reforming and I don't care a fig for
conventional society!""You tell me that you no longer love me and that you found existence
with me unsupportable.Why then are you not willing to end it?""It is true, I no longer love you, but while I live, no other woman
shall usurp my place."When you broke your marriage vows, you forfeited your right
to a place in my life.You can have
all the money you can possibly want as long as you neither do nor say
anything to imperil the reputation of the young lady in question.""All the wealth in the world could not buy my silence!""In order to
shield a poor innocent child, you demand that I sacrifice my freedom, my
future, even my honour?Have you no sense of justice, no pity?"It is now for you to decide whether I
am to go or stay.Cyril looked into her white, set face; what he read there destroyed his
last, lingering hope."Stay," he muttered through his clenched teeth.CHAPTER XX

"I KNOW IT, COUSIN CYRIL"


Cyril leaned wearily back in his chair.He was in that state of
apathetic calm which sometimes succeeds a violent emotion.Of his wife
he had neither seen or heard anything since they parted the night
before.Cyril started, for he had not noticed Peter's entrance and the
suppressed excitement of the latter's manner alarmed him."She's 'ere, my lord," replied Peter, dropping his voice till it was
almost a whisper."The--the young lady, my lord, as you took charge of on the train.I was
just passing through the 'all as she came in and so----"

"Here?""Why didn't you show her up at once?""If 'er Ladyship should 'ear----"

"Mind your own business, you fool, or----"

But Peter had already scuttled out of the room.Cyril waited, every nerve strung to the highest tension.Yet if his visitor was really Anita, some new
misfortune must have occurred!It seemed to him ages before the door
again opened and admitted a small, cloaked figure, whose features were
practically concealed by a heavy veil.A glance, however, sufficed to
assure him that it was indeed Anita who stood before him.While Cyril
was struggling to regain his composure, she lifted her veil.The
desperation of her eyes appalled him.cried Cyril, striding forward and seizing
her hands."Lord Wilmersley--" Cyril jumped as if he had been shot."Yes," she
continued, "I know who you are.For the first time the ghost of a smile hovered round her lips.What a blundering fool I have been from first to last!"For some days I had been haunted by
fragmentary visions of the past and before I saw you yesterday, I was
practically certain that you were not my husband.It was not without
a struggle that I finally made up my mind that you had deceived me.I
told myself again and again that you were not the sort of a man who
would take advantage of an unprotected girl; yet the more I thought
about it, the more convinced I became that my suspicions were correct.Then I tried to imagine what reason you could have for posing as my
husband, but I could think of none.I didn't know what
to do, whom to turn to; for if I could not trust you, whom could I
trust?When I heard my name, it was as if a dim light suddenly flooded
my brain.I remembered leaving Geralton, but little by
little I realised with dismay that I was still completely in the dark as
to who you were, why you had come into my life.It seemed to me that if
I could not discover the truth, I should go mad.Then I decided to
appeal to Miss Trevor.I was somehow convinced that she did not know who I was, but I said
to myself that she would certainly have heard of my disappearance, for I
could not believe that Arthur had allowed me to go out of his life
without moving heaven and earth to find me.""No; it was Miss Trevor who told me that Arthur was dead--that he had
been murdered.""You see," she added with
pathetic humility, "there are still so many things I do not remember.Even now I can hardly believe that I, I of all people, killed my
husband."Cyril ached for pity of her."Why take it for granted that you did?"he suggested, partly from a
desire to comfort her, but also because there really lingered a doubt in
his mind."Not at present, but----"

She threw up her hands with a gesture of despair.But I never meant to--you will believe that, won't
you?Those doctors were right, I must have been insane!"Arthur only intended to frighten you by sending
for those men.""But if I was not crazy, why can I remember so little of what took place
on that dreadful night and for some time afterwards?""I am told that a severe shock often has that effect," replied Cyril."But, oh, how I wish you could answer a few questions!I don't want to
raise your hopes; but there is one thing that has always puzzled me and
till that is explained I for one shall always doubt whether it was you
who killed Arthur."Again the eager light leaped into her eyes."Oh, tell me quickly what--what makes you think that I may not have done
so?"Cyril contemplated her a moment in silence.He longed to pursue the
topic, but was fearful of the effect it might have on her."Yet now that she knows the worst, it may be a relief to her to talk
about it," he said to himself."Yes, I will risk it," he finally
decided."Do you remember that you put a drug in Arthur's coffee?""Then you must have expected to make your escape before he regained
consciousness.""Then why did you arm yourself with a pistol?""But if you shot Arthur, you must have had a pistol."She stared at Cyril in evident bewilderment."I could have sworn I had no pistol."Cyril tried to control his rising excitement."You knew, however, that
Arthur owned one?""Yes, but I never knew where he kept it.""You are sure you have not forgotten----"

"No, no!""My memory is perfectly clear up to the
time when Arthur seized me and threw me on the floor.""Oh, yes, I have a vague recollection of a long walk through the
dark--of a train--of you--of policemen.But everything is so confused
that I can be sure of nothing."Cyril paced the room deep in thought."It seems to me incredible," he said at last, "that if you did not even
know where to look for a pistol, you should have found it, to say
nothing of having been able to use it, while you were being beaten into
unconsciousness by that brute.""It is extraordinary, and yet I must have done so.For it has been
proved, has it not, that Arthur and I were absolutely alone?"How can we be sure that some one was not concealed in
the room or did not climb in through the window or--why, there are a
thousand possibilities which can never be proved!"she exclaimed, her whole body trembling with eagerness."I now
remember that I had put all my jewels in a bag, and as that has
disappeared, a burglar--" But as she scanned Cyril's face, she paused."You had the bag with you at the nursing home.The jewels are safe," he
said very gently."Then," she cried, "it is useless trying to deceive ourselves any
longer--I killed Arthur and must face the consequences.""But don't you see that I can't spend the rest of my life in hiding?Think what it would mean to live in daily, hourly dread of exposure?That is not what
I am afraid of.But the idea of you, Anita, in prison.Why, it is out of
the question."And if it did, what of it?"There is nothing you can do," she said, laying her hand gently on his
arm.Oh, I can never thank you enough
for all your goodness to me!""Don't--don't--I would gladly give my life for you!""I know it, Cousin Cyril," she murmured, with downcast eyes.A wave of
colour swept for a moment over her face.With a mighty effort he strove to regain his composure.Yes, that was what he was to her--that was all he could
ever be to her."I know how noble, how unselfish you are," she continued, lifting her
brimming eyes to his.Anita, is it possible that you----"

"Hush!Let me go," she cried, for Cyril had seized
her hand and was covering it with kisses.Cyril and Anita moved hurriedly
away from each other."Inspector Griggs is 'ere, my lord."Peter's face had resumed its usual stolid expression.He appeared not to
notice that his master and the latter's guest were standing in strained
attitudes at opposite ends of the room.Cyril motioned Peter impatiently away."This is the best
time for me to give myself up."I have a plan----"

He was interrupted by the reappearance of Peter."The inspector is very sorry, my lord, but he has to see you at once, 'e
says.""It is no use putting it off," Anita said firmly.If you don't, I shall go down and speak to him myself."Cyril did not know what to do.So turning to the latter, he said:

"You can bring him up in ten minutes--not before."Anita," implored Cyril, as soon as they were again alone, "I beg you
not to do this thing.If a plan that I have in mind succeeds, you will
be able to leave the country and begin life again under another name."She listened attentively, but when he had finished she shook her head."I will not allow you to attempt it.If your fraud were discovered--and
it would surely be discovered--your life would be ruined.""I tell you I will not hear of it.No, I am determined to end this
horrible suspense."I entreat you at all events to wait a little while longer."Was there
nothing he could say to turn her from her purpose?If she should hear, if she should know--" he began
tentatively.He was amazed at the effect of his words."Why didn't you tell me that she was here?""Of course, I haven't the slightest intention of
involving her in my affairs."But you can't leave the house without Griggs seeing you, and he would
certainly guess who you are.Stay in the next room till he is gone, that
is all I ask of you.Here, quick, I hear footsteps on the stairs."Cyril had hardly time to fling himself into a chair before the inspector
was announced.CHAPTER XXI

THE TRUTH


"Good-morning, my lord.Rather early to disturb you, I am afraid."Cyril noticed that Griggs's manner had undergone a subtle change.Although perfectly respectful, he seemed to hold himself rigidly aloof.There was even a certain solemnity about his trivial greeting.Cyril
felt that another blow was impending.Instantly and instinctively he
braced himself to meet it."The fact is, my lord, I should like to ask you a few questions, but I
warn you that your answers may be used against you.""Have you missed a bag, my lord?"It has turned up at last," thought Cyril.He knows more about my things than I do," he
managed to answer, as he lifted a perfectly expressionless face to
Griggs's inspection.But I fancy that as far as this particular bag is
concerned, that is not the case.""Because I do not see what reason he could have had for hiding one of
his master's bags up the chimney.""So the bag was found up the chimney?Will you tell me what motive I am
supposed to have had for wishing to conceal it?Did it contain anything you thought I might want to
get rid of?"We know that Priscilla Prentice bought this bag a
fortnight ago in Newhaven.Now, if you are able to explain how it came
into your possession, I would strongly advise your doing so.""I have never to my knowledge laid eyes on the girl, and I cannot,
therefore, believe that a bag of hers has been found here.""We can prove it," replied the inspector."The maker's name is inside
and the man who sold it to her is willing to swear that it is the
identical bag.One of our men has made friends with your chamber-maid
and she confessed that she had discovered it stuffed up the chimney in
your bedroom.She is a stupid girl and thought you had thrown it away,
so she took it.Only afterwards, it occurred to her that you had a
purpose in placing the bag where she had found it and she was going to
return it when my man prevented her from doing so."I congratulate
you, Inspector," said Cyril, trying to speak superciliously."But you
omitted to mention the most important link in the chain of evidence you
have so cleverly forged against me," he continued."How am I supposed to
have got hold of this bag?I did not stop in Newhaven and you have had
me so closely watched that you must know that since my arrival in
England I have met no one who could have given it to me.""No, my lord, we are by no means sure of this.It is
true that we have, so to speak, kept an eye on you, but, till yesterday,
we had no reason to suspect that you had any connection with the murder,
so we did not think it necessary to have you closely followed.There
have been hours when we have had no idea where you were.""It is quite possible," continued the inspector without heeding Cyril's
interruption, "that you have met either Prentice or Lady Wilmersley, the
dowager, I mean."And why should they have given this bag to me, of all people?Surely you must see that they could have found many easier, as well as
safer, ways of disposing of it.""Quite so, my lord, and that is why I am inclined to believe that it was
not through either of them that the bag came into your possession.I
think it more probable that her Ladyship brought it with her.""You told me yourself that her Ladyship met you in Newhaven; that, in
fact, she had spent the night of the murder there."Cyril clutched the table convulsively.Why had it never
occurred to him that his lies might involve an innocent person?"But this is absurd, you know," he stammered, in a futile effort to gain
time."There has been a terrible mistake, I tell you.""In that case her Ladyship can no doubt easily explain it."But if you
wish it, I will not question her till she has been examined by our
doctors."Cyril rose and moved automatically towards the door."Sorry, my lord, but for the present you can see her Ladyship only
before witnesses."What is the use of asking my permission?You are master here, so it
seems," exclaimed Cyril.His nerves were at last getting beyond his
control."I am only doing my duty and I assure you that I want to cause as little
unpleasantness as possible.""Ask her Ladyship please to come here as soon as she can get ready.If
she is asleep, it will be necessary to wake her."The two men sat facing each other in silence.Cyril was hardly conscious of the other's presence.He must think; he
knew he must think; but his brain seemed paralysed.There must be a way
of clearing his wife without casting suspicion on Anita.Was it possible that he was now called upon to choose
between the woman he hated and the woman he loved, between honour and
dishonour?The door opened and Amy came slowly into the room.She was wrapped in a red velvet dressing-gown and its warm colour
contrasted painfully with the greyness of her face and lips.On catching
sight of the inspector, she started, but controlling herself with an
obvious effort, she turned to her husband."You can see for yourself, Inspector, that her Ladyship is in no
condition to be questioned," remonstrated Cyril, moving quickly to his
wife's side."Just as you say, my lord, but in that case her Ladyship had better
finish her dressing.It will be necessary for her to accompany me to
headquarters.""I will not allow it," cried Cyril, almost beside himself and throwing a
protecting arm around Amy's shoulders.Her bloodshot eyes rested a moment on her husband, then gently
disengaging herself, she drew herself to her full height and faced the
inspector."His Lordship----"

"Do not listen to his Lordship.It is I who demand to be told the
truth.""Amy, I beg you--" interposed Cyril."No, no," she cried, shaking off her husband's hand.Don't you see that you are torturing me?"It is all my fault," began Cyril."I am waiting to hear what the inspector has to say."Griggs cast a questioning look at Cyril, which the latter answered by a
helpless shrug."A bag has been found in his Lordship's chimney, which was lately
purchased in Newhaven.But perhaps before
answering, you may wish to consult your legal adviser.""I will neither acknowledge nor deny anything until I have seen this bag
and know of what I am accused," she answered after a barely perceptible
pause.Griggs opened the door and called:

"Jones, the bag, please."Had the moment come when he must proclaim the truth?"Am I supposed to have bought this bag?"It was sold to Prentice, who was sempstress at Geralton
and we believe it is the one in which Lady Wilmersley carried off her
jewels."Amy gave a muffled exclamation, but almost instantly she regained her
composure."If that is so, how do you connect me with it?Because it happens to
have been found here, do you accuse me of having robbed my cousin?""No, my lady, but as you spent the night of the murder in Newhaven----"

To Cyril's surprise she shuddered from head to foot.she cried, stretching out her hands as if to ward off a blow.His Lordship himself told me that you had
joined him there."It was not her Ladyship who was with me.Her Ladyship was in
Paris at the time.Thank God, thought Cyril, he had at last found
a way of saving both his love and his honour.Of a murder which was committed while you were
still in France--" asked Griggs, lifting his eyebrows incredulously.I mean I instigated it--I hated my cousin--I needed the money, so
I hired an accomplice.Of course, if you insist upon it, I shall have to
arrest you, but I don't believe you had anything more to do with the
murder than I had, and I would stake my reputation on your being as
straight a gentleman as I ever met professionally.Wait a bit, my lord,
don't be 'asty."In his excitement Griggs dropped one of his carefully
guarded aitches."You have arrived in the nick of time.Campbell cast a bewildered look at the inspector."His Lordship says that he hired an assassin to murder Lord Wilmersley.""He _shall_ believe me," cried Cyril."I alone am responsible for
Wilmersley's death.The person who actually fired the shot was nothing
but my tool.Really, Cyril, you are too ridiculous,"
exclaimed Campbell.Suddenly he caught sight of Amy, cowering in the shadow of the curtain.Cyril gave Guy a look
in which he tried to convey all that he did not dare to say.I told him you were engaged, but he says
he would like to speak to you most particular.""I don't want to see him," began Cyril."Don't be a greater fool than you can help," exclaimed Campbell."How do
you know that he has not some important news?"I took the liberty of forcing
myself upon you at this moment, my lord, because I have just learnt
certain facts which----"

"It is too late to report," interposed Cyril hastily."Why, my lord, what is the use of pretending that you had anything to do
with the murder?I hurried here to tell you that there is no further
need of your sacrificing yourself.I have found out who----"

"Shut up, I say.cried
Cyril incoherently."Don't listen to his Lordship," said Amy."We all know, of course, that
he is perfectly innocent.She
cast a keen look at Cyril."That's just it," Judson agreed.I convinced
his Lordship that Lord Wilmersley was murdered by his wife.I have come
here to tell him that I was mistaken.It is lucky that I discovered the
truth in time."His relief
was so intense that it robbed him of all power of concealment.Amy's mouth hardened into a straight, inflexible line; her eyes
narrowed."I suppose that you have some fact to support your extraordinary
assertion?"demanded Griggs, unable to hide his vexation at finding that
his rival had evidently outwitted him."Certainly, but I will say no more till I have his Lordship's
permission."I am more anxious than
any one to discover the truth.""Permit me to suggest, my lord, that it would be better if I could first
speak to you in private.""Nonsense," exclaimed Cyril impatiently."I am tired of this eternal
secrecy."Very well, only remember, I warned you.""Have you forgotten, my lord, that I told you I always had an idea that
those two Frenchmen who were staying at the Red Lion Inn, were somehow
implicated in the affair?""But what possible motive could they have had for murdering my cousin?"The detective's eyes appeared to wander aimlessly from one of his
auditors to another.She moved slowly forward, and leaning her arm on
the mantelpiece confronted the four men.The detective inclined his head and again turned towards Cyril."Having once discovered their identity, my lord, their motive was quite
apparent.""The elder," began Judson, speaking very slowly, "is Monsieur de
Brissac.For a moment Cyril was too stunned to speak.He could do nothing but
stare stupidly at the detective.He
hardly knew what he was saying.He only realised confusedly that
something within him was crying to him to save her.A wonderful light suddenly transfigured Amy's drawn face."Cyril, would you really do this for----"

"Hush!""I don't care now who knows the truth.Don't you see that she is not accountable for what
she is saying?"He had forgotten everything but that she
was a woman--his wife."I killed Lord Wilmersley," Amy repeated, as if he had not spoken, "but
I did not murder him.""Does your Ladyship expect us to believe that you happened to call at
the castle at half-past ten in the evening, and that during an amicable
conversation you accidentally shot Lord Wilmersley?""No," replied Amy contemptuously, "of course not!"If your Ladyship had not ulterior purpose in going to Newhaven, why did
you disguise yourself as a boy and live there under an assumed name?And
who is this Frenchman who posed as your brother?""Monsieur de Brissac was my lover.When we discovered that his Lordship
was employing detectives, we went to Newhaven, because we thought that
it was the last place where they would be likely to look for us.I
disguised myself to throw them off the scent.""But the description the inspector gave me of the boy did not resemble
you in the least," insisted Cyril.I merely cut off my hair and dyed it.She
snatched the black wig from her head, disclosing a short crop of reddish
curls."You have yet to explain," resumed the inspector sternly, "what took you
to Geralton in the middle of the night.Under the circumstances I should
have thought your Ladyship would hardly have cared to visit his
Lordship's relations."Ignoring Griggs, Amy turned to her husband."My going there was the purest accident," she began in a dull,
monotonous voice, almost as if she were reciting a lesson, but as she
proceeded, her excitement increased till finally she became so absorbed
in her story that she appeared to forget her hearers completely."I was
horribly restless, so we spent most of our time motoring and often
stayed out very late.I noticed that we had
stopped within a short walk of the castle.As I had never seen it except
at a distance, it occurred to me that I would like to have a nearer view
of the place.In my boy's clothes I found it fairly easy to climb the
low wall which separates the gardens from the park.Not a light was to
be seen, so, as there seemed no danger of my being discovered, I
ventured on to the terrace.As I stood there, I heard a faint cry.My
first impulse was to retrace my footsteps as quickly as possible, but
when I realised that it was a woman who was crying for help, I felt that
I must find out what was the matter.Running in the direction from which
the sound came, I turned a corner and found myself confronted by a
lighted window.The shrieks were now positively blood-curdling and there
was no doubt in my mind that some poor creature was being done to death
only a few feet away from me.The window was high above my head, but I
was determined to reach it.After several unsuccessful attempts I
managed to gain a foothold on the uneven surface of the wall and hoist
myself on to the window-sill.Luckily the window was partially open, so
I was able to slip noiselessly into the room and hide behind the
curtain.Peering through the folds, I saw a woman lying on the floor.Her bodice was torn open, exposing her bare back.Over her stood a man
who was beating her with a piece of cord which was attached to the waist
of a sort of Eastern dressing-gown he wore."'So you thought you would leave me, did you?'he cried over and over
again as the lash fell faster and faster.Not till I
send you to hell, which I will some day.'"At last he paused and wiped the perspiration from his brow.He was very
fat and his exertions were evidently telling on him.I have my pistol within reach of my
hand.Ah, you didn't know that, did you?'"The woman shuddered but made no attempt to rise."I was slowly recovering from the terror which had at first paralysed
me.I realised I must act at once if I meant to save Lady Wilmersley's
life."Dropping on my hands and knees, I crept cautiously toward it.'Kill
you, kill you, that is what I ought to do,' he kept repeating.No pistol was to be seen; yet I knew it was there.As I fumbled among his papers, my hand touched an ancient steel
gauntlet.Some instinct told me that I had found what I sought.But how
to open it was the question.Some agonising moments passed before I at
last accidentally pressed the spring and a pistol lay in my hand."He swung around and as he caught sight of the pistol levelled at his
head, the purple slowly faded from his face."Then seemingly reassured at finding that it was only a boy who
confronted him, he took a step forward.he blustered, but I noticed that his knees
shook and he made no further effort to move.There is a car waiting in the road,' I called
to the girl."I held him with my eye and saw his coward soul quiver with fear as I
moved deliberately nearer him."I knew rather than saw that she picked up a jacket and bag which lay
near the window.With a soft thud she dropped into the night.That is
the last I saw of her."As Lord Wilmersley saw his wife disappear, he gave a cry like a wounded
animal and rushed after her.He staggered back a few steps,
then turning he ran into the adjoining room.I heard a splash but did
not stop to find out what happened.Almost beside myself with terror, I
fled from the castle.If you have any more questions to ask, you had
better hurry."She stopped abruptly, trembling from head to foot, and glanced wildly
about her till her eyes rested on her husband.For a long, long moment
she regarded him in silence.She seemed to be gathering herself together
for a supreme effort.All four men watched her in breathless suspense.With her eyes still fastened on Cyril she fumbled in the bosom of her
dress, then her hand shot out, and before any one could prevent her, she
jabbed a hypodermic needle deep into her arm.cried Cyril, springing forward and wrenching the
needle from her.A beatific smile spread slowly over her face.She swayed a little and would have fallen if Cyril had not caught her."It is too late," she murmured.I--loved--you--so----"




CHAPTER XXII

CAMPBELL RESIGNS


Under a yew tree, overlooking a wide lawn, bordered on the farther side
by a bank of flowers, three people are sitting clustered around a
tea-table.One of them is a little old lady, the dearest old lady imaginable.By
her side, in a low basket chair, a girl is half sitting, half reclining.Her small figure, clad in a simple black frock, gives the impression of
extreme youth, which impression is heightened by the fact that her
curly, yellow hair, reaching barely to the nape of her neck, is caught
together by a black ribbon like a schoolgirl's.But when one looks more
closely into her pale face, one realises somehow that she is a woman and
a woman who has suffered--who still suffers.On the ground facing the younger woman a red-headed young man in white
flannels is squatting tailor-fashion.He is holding out an empty cup to
be refilled.exclaims the little old lady in a horrified tone."Why,
you have had three already!""My dear Trevie, let me inform you once and for all that I have
abandoned my figure.Why should I persist in the struggle now that Anita
refuses to smile on me?When one's heart is broken, one had better make
the most of the few pleasures one can still enjoy.Anita took no notice of his sally; her eyes were fixed on the distant
horizon; she seemed absorbed in her own thoughts."By the way," remarked Campbell casually as he sipped his tea, "I spent
last Sunday at Geralton."A faint flutter of
the eyelids was the only indication she gave of having heard him, yet
Guy was convinced that she was waiting breathlessly for him to continue.You would hardly
know it--the interior, I mean."Although he had pointedly addressed
Anita, she made no comment.It was only after a long silence that she
finally spoke.She plays all day long with the dolls Cyril bought for
her.Miss Trevor took up her knitting, which had been lying in her lap, and
was soon busy avoiding the pitfalls a heel presents to the unwary."I think I will go for a walk," said Anita, rising slowly from her seat.There was a hint of exasperation in her voice which escaped neither of
her hearers.Miss Trevor peered anxiously over her spectacles at the retreating
figure.Campbell's rubicund countenance had grown strangely grave.he asked as soon as Anita was out of earshot.Miss Trevor shook her head disconsolately.I can't imagine what can be the matter with her.She
seemed at one time to have recovered from her terrible experience.But
now, as you can see for yourself, she is absolutely wretched.She hardly eats enough to keep a bird alive.If
she goes on like this much longer, she will fret herself into her grave.Yet whenever I question her, she assures me that she is all right.I
really don't know what I ought to do.""Has it never occurred to you that she may be wondering why Wilmersley
has never written to her, nor been to see her?""She inquires after everybody
at Geralton except Cyril.Doesn't that strike you as very suspicious?""Oh, you don't mean that----"

He nodded.You told me yourself that she had only seen
him three or four times.""True, but you must remember that they met under very romantic
conditions.And Cyril is the sort of chap who would be likely to appeal
to a girl's imagination.""I wish I didn't," muttered Guy under his breath.She heard him, however, and laid her small, wrinkled hand tenderly on
his shoulder."My poor boy, I guessed your trouble long ago."It doesn't hurt any longer--not much at least.When one
realises a thing is quite hopeless, one somehow ends by adjusting
oneself to the inevitable.What I feel for her now is more worship than
love.I want above all things that she should be happy, and if Cyril can
make her so, I would gladly speed his wooing.""Do you think he has any thought of her?""Then why has he given no sign of life all these months?""I fancy he is waiting for the year of their mourning to elapse.But I
confess that I am surprised that he has been able to restrain his
impatience as long as this.Every day I have expected--"

"By Jove!"cried Campbell, springing to his feet, "there he is now!"Miss Trevor turned and saw a tall figure emerge from the house.Being plunged suddenly into the midst of romance, together with the
unexpected and dramatic arrival of the hero, was too much for the little
lady's composure.Her bag, her knitting, her glasses fell to the ground
unheeded as she rose hurriedly to receive Lord Wilmersley.Let me give you a cup of tea, or would you prefer
some whiskey and soda?"She was so flustered that she hardly knew what
she was saying.Rather fancied I
might run across you."Cyril's eyes strayed anxiously hither and thither.Cyril gave a start of guilty surprise."Yes, I was wondering where
she was.""She has gone for a little walk, but as she never leaves the grounds,
she can't be very far off," said Miss Trevor."Perhaps--" Cyril hesitated; he was painfully embarrassed."I will show you where you are likely to find
her."I did rather want to see her--ahem, on business!"jeered Campbell as he sauntered off.For a moment Cyril glared at Guy's back indignantly; then mumbling an
apology to Miss Trevor, he hastened after him.They had gone only a short distance before they espied a small,
black-robed figure coming towards them.Guy stopped short; he glanced at
Cyril, but the latter was no longer conscious of his presence.Without a
word he turned and hurriedly retraced his footsteps."Well, Trevie," he said, "I must be going.His manner was quite ostentatiously cheerful.Miss Trevor, however, was not deceived by it."You are a dear,
courageous boy," she murmured.With a flourish of his hat that seemed to repudiate all sympathy, Guy
turned on his heel and marched gallantly away.Meanwhile, in another part of the garden, a very different scene was
being enacted.On catching sight of each other Cyril and Anita had both halted
simultaneously.Cyril's heart pounded so violently that he could hardly
hear himself think."I must be calm," he said to himself.If I only had a little more time to collect my wits!I know I
shall make an ass of myself!"As these thoughts went racing through his brain, he had been moving
almost automatically forward.Already he could distinguish the soft
curve of her parted lips and the colour of her dilated eyes.He was conscious of a wild desire to fly from
her presence; but it was too late.For a moment neither moved, but under the insistence of his gaze her
eyes slowly sank before his.Then, without a word, as one who merely
claims his own, he flung his arms around her and crushed her to his
heart.THE END

_Nearly One Million copies of Mrs.As
soon as they faced round again, our line was halted only about seven
hundred yards from them, and just then we could see our cavalry
debouching on to the Grand Trunk road about a mile from where we were.My company was in the centre of the road, and I could see the tips of
the lances of the Ninth wheeling into line for a charge right in the
enemy's rear.He was completely out-generalled, and his retreat cut off.The excitement was just then intense, as we dared not fire for fear of
hitting our men in the rear.The Forty-First Native Infantry was the
principal regiment of the enemy's line on the Grand Trunk road.Directly
they saw the Lancers in their rear they formed square while the enemy's
cavalry charged our men, but were met in fine style by Hodson's Horse
and sent flying across the fields in all directions.The Ninth came down
on the square of the Native Infantry, who stood their ground and opened
fire.The Lancers charged well up to within about thirty yards, when the
horses turned off right and left from the solid square.We were just
preparing to charge it with the bayonet, when at that moment the
squadrons were brought round again, just as a hawk takes a circle for a
swoop on its prey, and we saw Sergeant-Major May, who was mounted on a
powerful untrained horse, dash on the square and leap right into it,
followed by the squadron on that side.The square being thus broken, the
other troops of the Ninth rode into the flying mass, and in less than
five minutes the Forty-First regiment of Native Infantry was wiped out
of the ranks of the mutineers.The enemy's line of retreat became a
total rout, and the plain for miles was strewn with corpses speared down
by the Lancers or hewn down by the keen-edged sabres of Hodson's Horse.Our infantry line now advanced, but there was nothing for us to do but
collect the ammunition-carts and baggage of the enemy.Just about sunset
we halted and saw the Lancers and Sikhs returning with the captured
standards and every gun which the enemy had brought into the field in
the morning.The infantry formed up along the side of the Grand Trunk
road to cheer the cavalry as they returned.It was a sight never to be
forgotten,--the infantry and sailors cheering the Lancers and Sikhs, and
the latter returning our cheers and waving the captured standards and
their lances and sabres over their heads!Sir Colin Campbell rode up,
and lifting his hat, thanked the Ninth Lancers and Sikhs for their day's
work.It was reported in the camp that Sir Hope Grant had recommended
Sergeant-Major May for the Victoria Cross, but that May had modestly
remonstrated against the honour, saying that every man in the Ninth was
as much entitled to the Cross as he was, and that he was only able to
break the square by the accident of being mounted on an untrained horse
which charged into the square instead of turning off from it.This is of
course hearsay, but I believe it is fact.I may here remark that this charge of the Lancers forcibly impressed me
with the absurdity of our cavalry-drill for the purpose of breaking an
infantry square.On field-days in time of peace our cavalry were made
to charge squares of infantry, and directly the horses came within
thirty or forty yards the squadrons opened out right and left, galloping
clear of the square under the blank fire of the infantry.The horses
were thus drilled to turn off and gallop clear of the squares, instead
of charging home right through the infantry.When it came to actual war
the horses, not being reasoning animals, naturally acted just as on a
field-day; instead of charging straight into the square, they galloped
right past it, simply because they were drilled to do so.Of course, I
do not propose that several battalions of infantry should be slaughtered
every field-day for the purpose of training cavalry.But I would have
the formation altered, and instead of having the infantry in solid
squares, I would form them into quarter distance columns, with lanes
between the companies wide enough for the cavalry to gallop through
under the blank fire of the infantry.The horses would thus be trained
to gallop straight on, and no square of infantry would be able to resist
a charge of well-trained cavalry when it came to actual war.I am
convinced, in my own mind, that this was the reason that the untrained
remount ridden by Sergeant-Major May charged into the square of the
Forty-First, and broke it, while the well-drilled horses galloped round
the flanks in spite of their riders.But the square once being broken,
the other horses followed as a matter of course.However, we are now in
the age of breech-loaders and magazine rifles, and I fear the days of
cavalry charging squares of infantry are over.But we are still a long
way from the millennium, and the experience of the past may yet be
turned to account for the wars of the future.We reached Futtehghur on the morning of the 3rd of January to find it
deserted, the enemy having got such a "drubbing" that it had struck
terror into their reserves, which had bolted across the Ganges, leaving
large quantities of Government property behind them, consisting of tents
and all the ordnance stores of the Gun-carriage Agency.The enemy had
also established a gun and shot and shell foundry here, and a
powder-factory, all of which they had abandoned, leaving a number of
brass guns in the lathes, half turned, with many more just cast, and
large quantities of metal and material for the manufacture of both
powder and shot.During the afternoon of the day of our arrival the whole force was
turned out, owing to a report that the Nawab of Furruckabad was still in
the town; and it was said that the civil officer with the force had sent
a proclamation through the city that it would be given over to plunder
if the Nawab was not surrendered.Whether this was true or not, I cannot
say.The district was no longer under martial law, as from the date of
the defeat of the Gwalior Contingent the civil power had resumed
authority on the right bank of the Ganges.But so far as the country was
concerned, around Futtehghur at least, this merely meant that the
hangmen's noose was to be substituted for rifle-bullet and bayonet.However, our force had scarcely been turned out to threaten the town of
Furruckabad when the Nawab was brought out, bound hand and foot, and
carried by _coolies_ on a common country _charpoy_.[35] I don't know
what process of trial he underwent; but I fear he had neither jury nor
counsel, and I know that he was first smeared over with pig's fat,
flogged by sweepers, and then hanged.This was by the orders of the
civil commissioner.Both Sir Colin Campbell and Sir William Peel were
said to have protested against the barbarity, but this I don't know for
certain.We halted in Futtehghur till the 6th, on which date a brigade, composed
of the Forty-Second, Ninety-Third, a regiment of Punjab infantry, a
battery of artillery, a squadron of the Ninth Lancers, and Hodson's
Horse, marched to Palamhow in the Shumshabad district.This town had
been a hot-bed of rebellion under the leadership of a former native
collector of revenue, who had proclaimed himself Raja of the district,
and all the bad characters in it had flocked to his standard.However,
the place was occupied without opposition.We encamped outside the town,
and the civil police, along with the commissioner, arrested great
numbers, among them being the man who had proclaimed himself the Raja or
Nawab for the Emperor of Delhi.My company, with some of Hodson's Horse
and two artillery guns, formed a guard for the civil commissioner in the
_chowk_ or principal square of the town.The commissioner held his court
in what had formerly been the _kotwaiee_ or police station.I cannot say
what form of trial the prisoners underwent, or what evidence was
recorded against them.I merely know that they were marched up in
batches, and shortly after marched back again to a large tree of the
banian species, which stood in the centre of the square, and hanged
thereon.This went on from about three o'clock in the afternoon till
daylight the following morning, when it was reported that there was no
more room on the tree, and by that time there were one hundred and
thirty men hanging from its branches.Many charges of cruelty and want of pity have been made against the
character of Hodson.This makes me here mention a fact that certainly
does not tend to prove these charges.During the afternoon of the day of
which I write, Hodson visited the squadron of his regiment forming the
cavalry of the civil commissioner's guard.Just at the time of his visit
the commissioner wanted a hangman, and asked if any man of the
Ninety-Third would volunteer for the job, stating as an inducement that
all valuables in the way of rings or money found on the persons of the
condemned would become the property of the executioner.No one
volunteering for the job, the commissioner asked Jack Brian, a big tall
fellow who was the right-hand man of the company, if he would act as
executioner.Jack Brian turned round with a look of disgust, saying:
"Wha do ye tak' us for?We of the Ninety-Third enlisted to fight men
with arms in their hands.I widna' become yer hangman for all the loot
in India!"Captain Hodson was standing close by, and hearing the answer,
said, "Well answered, my brave fellow.I wish to shake hands with you,"
which he did.Then turning to Captain Dawson, Hodson said: "I'm sick of
work of this kind.I'm glad I'm not on duty;" and he mounted his horse,
and rode off.However, some _domes_[36] or sweeper-police were found to
act as hangmen, and the trials and executions proceeded.We returned to Futtehghur on the 12th of January and remained in camp
there till the 26th, when another expedition was sent out in the same
direction.But this time only the right wing of the Ninety-Third and a
wing of the Forty-Second formed the infantry, so my company remained in
camp.This second force met with more opposition than the first one.Lieutenant Macdowell, Hodson's second in command, and several troopers
were killed, and Hodson himself and some of his men were badly wounded,
Hodson having two severe cuts on his sword arm; while the infantry had
several men killed who were blown up with gunpowder.This force returned
on the 28th of January, and either on the 2nd or 3rd of February we left
Futtehghur _en route_ again for Lucknow _via_ Cawnpore.We reached Cawnpore by ordinary marches, crossed into Oude, and encamped
at Oonao till the whole of the siege-train was passed on to Lucknow.FOOTNOTES:

THE STRANGE STORY OF JAMIE GREEN


When we returned to Cawnpore, although we had been barely two months
away, we found it much altered.Many of the burnt-down bungalows were
being rebuilt, and the fort at the end of the bridge of boats had become
quite a strong place.The well where the murdered women and children
were buried was now completely filled up, and a wooden cross erected
over it.I visited the slaughter-house again, and found the walls of the
several rooms all scribbled over both in pencil and charcoal.This had
been done since my first visit in October; I am positive on this point.The unfortunate women who were murdered in the house left no writing on
the walls whatever.There was writing on the walls of the barrack-rooms
of Wheeler's entrenchment, mostly notes that had been made during the
siege, but none on the walls of the slaughter-house.As mentioned in my
last chapter, we only halted one day in Cawnpore before crossing into
Oude, and marching to Oonao about the 10th of February, we encamped
there as a guard for the siege-train and ordnance-park which was being
pushed on to Lucknow.While at Oonao a strange thing happened, which I shall here set down.Men live such busy lives in India that many who may have heard the story
at the time have possibly forgotten all about it, while to most of my
home-staying readers it will be quite fresh.Towards the end of February, 1858, the army for the siege of Lucknow was
gradually being massed in front of the doomed city, and lay, like a huge
boa-constrictor coiled and ready for its spring, all along the road from
Cawnpore to the Alumbagh.A strong division, consisting of the
Forty-Second and Ninety-Third Highlanders, the Fifty-Third, the Ninth
Lancers, Peel's Naval Brigade, the siege-train, and several batteries of
field-artillery, with the Fourth Punjab Infantry and other Punjabee
corps, lay at Oonao under the command of General Sir Edward Lugard and
Brigadier Adrian Hope.We had been encamped in that place for about ten
days,--the monotony of our lives being only occasionally broken by the
sound of distant cannonading in front--when we heard that General
Outram's position at the Alumbagh had been vigorously attacked by a
force from Lucknow, sometimes led by the Moulvie, and at others by the
Begum in person.Now and then somewhat duller sounds came from the rear,
which, we understood, arose from the operations of Sir Robert Napier and
his engineers, who were engaged in blowing up the temples of Siva and
Kalee overlooking the _ghats_ at Cawnpore; not, as some have asserted,
out of revenge, but for military considerations connected with the
safety of the bridge of boats across the Ganges.During one of these days of comparative inaction, I was lying in my tent
reading some home papers which had just arrived by the mail, when I
heard a man passing through the camp, calling out, "Plum-cakes!The
advent of a plum-cake _wallah_ was an agreeable change from ration-beef
and biscuit, and he was soon called into the tent, and his own maxim of
"taste and try before you buy" freely put into practice.This plum-cake
vendor was a very good-looking, light- native in the prime of
life, dressed in scrupulously clean white clothes, with dark, curly
whiskers and mustachios, carefully trimmed after the fashion of the
Mahommedan native officers of John Company's army.He had a
well-developed forehead, a slightly aquiline nose, and intelligent eyes.Altogether his appearance was something quite different from that of the
usual camp-follower.But his companion, or rather the man employed as
_coolie_ to carry his basket, was one of the most villainous-looking
specimens of humanity I ever set eyes on.As was the custom in those
days, seeing that he did not belong to our own bazaar, and being the
non-commissioned officer in charge of the tent, I asked the plum-cake
man if he was provided with a pass for visiting the camp?"Oh yes,
Sergeant _sahib_," he replied, "there's my pass all in order, not from
the Brigade-Major, but from the Brigadier himself, the Honourable Adrian
Hope.I'm Jamie Green, mess-_khansama_[37] of the late (I forget the
regiment he mentioned), and I have just come to Oonao with a letter of
introduction to General Hope from Sherer _sahib_, the magistrate and
collector of Cawnpore.You will doubtless know General Hope's
handwriting."And there it was, all in order, authorising the bearer, by
name Jamie Green, etc.etc., to visit both the camp and outpost for the
sale of his plum-cakes, in the handwriting of the brigadier, which was
well known to all the non-commissioned officers of the Ninety-Third,
Hope having been colonel of the regiment.Next to his appearance what struck me as the most remarkable thing about
Jamie Green was the purity and easy flow of his English, for he at once
sat down beside me, and asked to see the newspapers, and seemed anxious
to know what the English press said about the mutiny, and to talk of all
subjects connected with the strength, etc., of the army, the
preparations going forward for the siege of Lucknow, and how the
newly-arrived regiments were likely to stand the hot weather.In course
of conversation I made some remarks about the fluency of his English,
and he accounted for it by stating that his father had been the
mess-_khansama_ of a European regiment, and that he had been brought up
to speak English from his childhood, that he had learned to read and
write in the regimental school, and for many years had filled the post
of mess-writer, keeping all the accounts of the mess in English.During
this time the men in the tent had been freely trying the plum-cakes, and
a squabble arose between one of them and Jamie Green's servant about
payment.When I made some remark about the villainous look of the
latter Green replied: "Oh, never mind him; he is an Irishman, and his
name is Micky.His mother belongs to the regimental bazaar of the
Eighty-Seventh Royal Irish, and he lays claim to the whole regiment,
including the sergeant-major's cook, for his father.He has just come
down from the Punjab with the Agra convoy, but the commanding officer
dismissed him at Cawnpore, because he had a young wife of his own, and
was jealous of the good looks of Micky.But," continued Jamie Green, "a
joke is a joke, but to eat a man's plum-cakes and then refuse to pay for
them must be a Highland joke!"On this every man in the tent,
appreciating the good humour of Jamie Green, turned on the man who had
refused payment, and he was obliged to fork out the amount demanded.Jamie Green and Micky passed on to another tent, after the former had
borrowed a few of the latest of my newspapers.Thus ended my first
interview with the plum-cake vendor.The second one was more interesting, and with a sadder termination.On
the evening of the day after the events just described, I was on duty as
sergeant in charge of our camp rear-guard, and at sunset when the
orderly-corporal came round with the evening grog, he told us the
strange news that Jamie Green, the plum-cake _wallah_, had been
discovered to be a spy from Lucknow, had been arrested, and was then
undergoing examination at the brigade-major's tent; and that it being
too late to hang him that night, he was to be made over to my guard for
safe custody, and that men had been warned for extra sentry on the
guard-tent.I need not say that I was very sorry to hear the
information, for, although a spy is at all times detested in the army,
and no mercy is ever shown to one, yet I had formed a strong regard for
this man, and a high opinion of his abilities in the short conversation
I had held with him the previous day; and during the interval I had been
thinking over how a man of his appearance and undoubted education could
hold so low a position as that of a common camp-follower.But now the
news that he had been discovered to be a spy accounted for the anomaly.It would be needless for me to describe the bitter feeling of all
classes against the mutineers, or rebels, and for any one to be
denounced as a spy simply added fuel to the flames of hatred.Asiatic
campaigns have always been conducted in a more remorseless spirit than
those between European nations, but the war of the Mutiny, as I have
before remarked in these reminiscences, was far worse than the usual
type of even Asiatic fighting.It was something horrible and downright
brutalising for an English army to be engaged in such a struggle, in
which no quarter was ever given or asked.It was a war of downright
butchery.Wherever the rebels met a Christian or a white man he was
killed without pity or remorse, and every native who had assisted any
such to escape, or was known to have concealed them, was as
remorselessly put to death wherever the rebels had the ascendant.And
wherever a European in power, either civil or military, met a rebel in
arms, or any native whatever on whom suspicion rested, his shrift was as
short and his fate as sure.The farce of putting an accused native on
his trial before any of the civil officers attached to the different
army-columns, after the civil power commenced to reassert its authority,
was simply a parody on justice and a protraction of cruelty.Under
martial law, punishment, whether deserved or not, was stern but sharp.But the civilian officers attached to the different movable columns for
the trial of rebels, as far as they came under my notice, were even more
relentless.No doubt these men excused themselves by the consideration
that they were engaged in suppressing rebellion and mutiny, and that the
actors on the other side had perpetrated great crimes.[38] So far as the
Commander-in-Chief was concerned, Sir Colin Campbell was utterly opposed
to extreme measures, and deeply deplored the wholesale executions by the
civil power.Although as a soldier he would have been the last man in
the country to spare rebels caught with arms in their hands, or those
whose guilt was well known (and I know for certain that he held the
action of Major Hodson with regard to the Delhi princes to have been
justifiable), I well remember how emphatically I once heard him express
his disgust when, on the march back from Futtehghur to Cawnpore, he
entered a mango-tope full of rotting corpses, where one of those special
commissioners had passed through with a movable column a few days
before.I had barely heard the news that Green
had been arrested as a spy, when he was brought to my guard by some of
the provost-marshal's staff, and handed over to me with instructions to
keep him safe till he should be called for next morning.He was
accompanied by the man who had carried his basket, who had also been
denounced as one of the butchers at Cawnpore in July, 1857.And here I
may state that the appearance of this man certainly did tally with the
description afterwards given of one of these butchers by Fitchett, an
Eurasian drummer attached to the Sixth Native Infantry which mutinied at
Cawnpore, who embraced the Mahommedan religion to save his life, and was
enrolled in the rebel force, but afterwards made his escape and
presented himself at Meerut for enlistment in the police levy raised in
October, 1858.What I am relating took place in February, 1858, about
eight months before the existence of Fitchett was known to the
authorities.However, when it was discovered that Fitchett had been
serving in one of the mutineers' regiments, he was called on to say what
he knew about the Cawnpore massacre, and I remember his statement was
considered the most consistent of any of the numerous narratives
published about it.Fitchett alleged that the sepoys of the Sixth
Native Infantry and other regiments, including the Nana Sahib's own
guard, had refused to kill the European women and children in the
_bibi-ghur_,[39] and that five men were then brought by a slave-girl or
mistress of the Nana to do it.Of the five men employed, two were
butchers and two were villagers, and the fifth man was "a stout
_bilaitee_[40] with very hairy hands."Fitchett further described one of
the butchers as a tall, ugly man, very dark, and very much disfigured by
smallpox, all points that tallied exactly with the appearance of this
_coolie_.I don't suppose that Fitchett could have known that a man
answering to his description had been hanged, as being one of the actors
in the Cawnpore tragedy, some eight months before, for I don't recollect
ever having seen the matter which I am relating mentioned in any
newspaper.My prisoners had no sooner been made
over to me, than several of the guard, as was usual in those days,
proposed to bring some pork from the bazaar to break their castes, as a
sort of preparation for their execution.This I at once denounced as a
proceeding which I certainly would not tolerate so long as I held charge
of the guard, and I warned the men that if any one attempted to molest
the prisoners, I should at once strip them of their belts, and place
them in arrest for disobedience of orders and conduct unworthy of a
British soldier, and the better-disposed portion of the guard at once
applauded my resolution.I shall never forget the look of gratitude
which came over the face of the unfortunate man who had called himself
Jamie Green, when he heard me give these orders.He at once said it was
an act of kindness which he had never expected, and for which he was
truly grateful; and he unhesitatingly pronounced his belief that Allah
and his Prophet would requite my kindness by bringing me safely through
the remainder of the war.I thanked my prisoner for his good wishes and
his prayers, and made him the only return in my power, viz., to cause
his hands to be unfastened to allow him to perform his evening's
devotions, and permitted him as much freedom as I possibly could,
consistent with safe custody.His fellow-prisoner merely received my
kindness with a scowl of sullen hatred, and when reproved by his master,
I understood him to say that he wished for no favour from infidel dogs;
but he admitted that the sergeant _sahib_, deserved a Mussulman's
gratitude for saving him from an application of pig's fat.After allowing my prisoners to perform their evening devotions, and
giving them such freedom as I could, I made up my mind to go without
sleep that night, for it would have been a serious matter for me if
either of these men had escaped.I also knew that by remaining on watch
myself I could allow them more freedom, and I determined they should
enjoy every privilege in my power for what would certainly be their last
night on earth, since it was doubtful if they would be spared to see
the sun rise.With this view, I sent for one of the Mahommedan
shopkeepers from the regimental bazaar, and told him to prepare at my
expense whatever food the prisoners would eat.To this the man replied
that since I, a Christian, had shown so much kindness to a Mussulman in
distress, the Mahommedan shopkeepers in the bazaar would certainly be
untrue to their faith if they should allow me to spend a single _pie_,
from my own pocket.After being supplied with a savoury meal from the bazaar, followed by a
fragrant hookah, to both of which he did ample justice, Jamie Green
settled himself on a rug which had been lent to him, and said "_Shook'r
Khooda!_, (Thanks be to God)," for having placed him under the charge of
such a merciful _sahib_, for this the last night of his life!"Such," he
continued, "has been my _kismut_, and doubtless Allah will reward you,
Sergeant _sahib_, in his own good time for your kindness to his
oppressed and afflicted servant.You have asked me to give you some
account of my life, and if it is really true that I am a spy.With
regard to being a spy in the ordinary meaning of the term, I most
emphatically deny the accusation.I am no spy; but I am an officer of
the Begum's army, come out from Lucknow to gain reliable information of
the strength of the army and siege-train being brought against us.I am
the chief engineer of the army of Lucknow, and came out on a
reconnoitring expedition, but Allah has not blessed my enterprise.I
intended to have left on my return to Lucknow this evening, and if fate
had been propitious, I would have reached it before sunrise to-morrow,
for I had got all the information which was wanted; but I was tempted to
visit Oonao once more, being on the direct road to Lucknow, because I
was anxious to see whether the siege-train and ammunition-park had
commenced to move, and it was my misfortune to encounter that son of a
defiled mother who denounced me as a spy.A contemptible wretch who, to
save his own neck from the gallows (for he first sold the English), now
wishes to divert attention from his former rascality by selling the
lives of his own countrymen and co-religionists; but Allah is just, he
will yet reap the reward of his treachery in the fires of Jehunnum.[41]

"You ask me," continued the man, "what my name is, and state that you
intend to write an account of my misfortune to your friends in Scotland.The people of England,--and by England I mean
Scotland as well--are just, and some of them may pity the fate of this
servant of Allah.I have friends both in London and in Edinburgh, for I
have twice visited both places.I belong to
one of the best families of Rohilcund, and was educated in the Bareilly
College, and took the senior place in all English subjects.From
Bareilly College I passed to the Government Engineering College at
Roorkee, and studied engineering for the Company's service, and passed
out the senior student of my year, having gained many marks in excess of
all the European pupils, both civil and military.I was nominated to the rank of _jemadar_, of the Company's
engineers, and sent to serve with a company on detached duty on the hill
roads as a native commissioned officer, but actually subordinate to a
European sergeant, a man who was my inferior in every way, except,
perhaps, in mere brute strength, a man of little or no education, who
would never have risen above the grade of a working-joiner in England.Like most ignorant men in authority, he exhibited all the faults of the
Europeans which most irritate and disgust us, arrogance, insolence, and
selfishness.Unless you learn the language of my countrymen, and mix
with the better-educated people of this country, you will never
understand nor estimate at its full extent the mischief which one such
man does to your national reputation.One such example is enough to
confirm all that your worst enemies can say about your national
selfishness and arrogance, and makes the people treat your pretensions
to liberality and sympathy as mere hypocrisy.I had not joined the
Company's service from any desire for wealth, but from the hope of
gaining honourable service; yet on the very threshold of that service I
met with nothing but disgrace and dishonour, having to serve under a man
whom I hated, yea, worse than hated, whom I despised.I wrote to my
father, and requested his permission to resign, and he agreed with me
that I the descendant of princes, could not serve the Company under
conditions such as I have described.I resigned the service and returned
home, intending to offer my services to his late Majesty
Nussir-ood-Deen, King of Oude; but just when I reached Lucknow I was
informed that his Highness Jung Bahadoor of Nepal, who is now at
Goruckpore with an army of Goorkhas coming to assist in the loot of
Lucknow, was about to visit England, and required a secretary well
acquainted with the English language.I at once applied for the post,
and being well backed by recommendations both from native princes and
English officials, I secured the appointment, and in the suite of the
Maharaja I landed in England for the first time, and, among other
places, we visited Edinburgh, where your regiment, the Ninety-Third
Highlanders, formed the guard of honour for the reception of his
Highness.Little did I think when I saw a kilted regiment for the first
time, that I should ever be a prisoner in their tents in the plains of
Hindustan; but who can predict or avoid his fate?"Well, I returned to India, and filled several posts at different native
courts till 1854, when I was again asked to visit England in the suite
of Azeemoolla Khan, whose name you must have often heard in connection
with this mutiny and rebellion.On the death of the Peishwa, the Nana
had appointed Azeemoolla Khan to be his agent.He, like myself, had
received a good education in English, under Gunga Deen, head-master of
the Government school at Cawnpore.Azeemoolla was confident that, if he
could visit England, he would be able to have the decrees of Lord
Dalhousie against his master reversed, and when I joined him he was
about to start for England, well supplied with money to engage the best
lawyers, and also to bribe high officials, if necessary.But I need not
give you any account of our mission.You already know that, so far as
London drawing-rooms went, it proved a social success, but as far as
gaining our end a political failure; and we left England after spending
over L50,000, to return to India _via_ Constantinople in 1855.From
Constantinople we visited the Crimea, where we witnessed the assault and
defeat of the English on the 18th of June, and were much struck by the
wretched state of both armies in front of Sebastopol.Thence we returned
to Constantinople, and there met certain real or pretended Russian
agents, who made large promises of material support if Azeemoolla could
stir up a rebellion in India.It was then that I and Azeemoolla formed
the resolution of attempting to overthrow the Company's Government, and,
_Shook'r Khooda!_ we have succeeded in doing that; for from the
newspapers which you lent me, I see that the Company's _raj_ has gone,
and that their charter for robbery and confiscation will not be renewed.Although we have failed to wrest the country from the English, I hope we
have done some good, and that our lives will not be sacrificed in vain;
for I believe direct government under the English parliament will be
more just than was that of the Company, and that there is yet a future
before my oppressed and downtrodden countrymen, although I shall not
live to see it."I do not speak, _sahib_, to flatter you or to gain your favour.I have
already gained that, and I know that you cannot help me any farther than
you are doing, and that if you could, your sense of duty would not let
you.I know I must die; but the unexpected kindness which you have shown
to me has caused me to speak my mind.I came to this tent with hatred in
my heart, and curses on my lips; but your kindness to me, unfortunate,
has made me, for the second time since I left Lucknow, ashamed of the
atrocities committed during this rebellion.The first time was at
Cawnpore a few days ago, when Colonel Napier of the Engineers was
directing the blowing up of the Hindoo temples on the Cawnpore _ghat_,
and a deputation of Hindoo priests came to him to beg that the temples
might not be destroyed.'Now, listen to me,' said Colonel Napier in
reply to them; 'you were all here when our women and children were
murdered, and you also well know that we are not destroying these
temples for vengeance, but for military considerations connected with
the safety of the bridge of boats.But if any man among you can prove to
me that he did a single act of kindness to any Christian man, woman, or
child, nay, if he can even prove that he uttered one word of
intercession for the life of any one of them, I pledge myself to spare
the temple where he worships.'I was standing in the crowd close to
Colonel Napier at the time, and I thought it was bravely spoken.There
was no reply, and the cowardly Brahmins slunk away.Napier gave the
signal and the temples leaped into the air; and I was so impressed with
the justness of Napier's remarks that I too turned away, ashamed."On this I asked him, "Were you in Cawnpore when the Mutiny broke out?"To which he replied: "No, thank God!I was in my home in Rohilcund; and
my hands are unstained by the blood of any one, excepting those who have
fallen in the field of battle.I knew that the storm was about to burst,
and had gone to place my wife and children in safety, and I was in my
village when I heard the news of the mutinies at Meerut and Bareilly.I
immediately hastened to join the Bareilly brigade, and marched with them
for Delhi.There I was appointed engineer-in-chief, and set about
strengthening the defences by the aid of a party of the Company's
engineers which had mutinied on the march from Roorkee to Meerut.I
remained in Delhi till it was taken by the English in September.I then
made my way to Lucknow with as many men as I could collect of the
scattered forces.We first marched to Muttra, where we were obliged to
halt till I threw a bridge of boats across the Jumna for the retreat of
the army.We had still a force of over thirty thousand men under the
command of Prince Feroz Shah and General Bukht Khan.As soon as I
reached Lucknow I was honoured with the post of chief-engineer.I was in
Lucknow in November when your regiment assisted to relieve the
Residency.I saw the horrible slaughter in the Secundrabagh.I had
directed the defences of that place the night before, and was looking
on from the Shah Nujeef when you assaulted it.I had posted over three
thousand of the best troops in Lucknow in the Secundrabagh, as it was
the key to the position, and not a man escaped.I nearly fainted; my
liver turned to water when I saw the green flag pulled down, and a
Highland bonnet set up on the flag-staff which I had erected the night
before.I knew then that all was over, and directed the guns of the Shah
Nujeef to open fire on the Secundrabagh.Since then I have planned and
superintended the construction of all the defensive works in and around
Lucknow.You will see them when you return, and if the sepoys and
artillerymen stand firmly behind them, many of the English army will
lose the number of their mess, as you call it, before you again become
masters of Lucknow."I then asked him if it was true that the man he had called Micky on our
first acquaintance had been one of the men employed by the Nana to
butcher the women and children at Cawnpore in July?To this he replied:
"I believe it is true, but I did not know this when I employed him; he
was merely recommended to me as a man on whom I could depend.If I had
known then that he was a murderer of women and children, I should have
had nothing to do with him, for it is he who has brought bad luck on me;
it is my _kismut_, and I must suffer.Your English proverb says, 'You
cannot touch pitch and escape defilement,' and I must suffer; Allah is
just.It is the conduct of wretches such as these that has brought the
anger of Allah on our cause."On this I asked him if he knew whether
there was any truth in the report of the European women having been
dishonoured before being murdered."_Sahib_," he replied, "you are a
stranger to this country or you would not ask such a question.Any one
who knows anything of the customs of this country and the strict rules
of caste, knows that all such stories are lies, invented to stir up
race-hatred, as if we had not enough of that on both sides already.That
the women and children were cruelly murdered I admit, but not one of
them was dishonoured; and all the sentences written on the walls of the
houses in Cawnpore, such as, 'We are at the mercy of savages, who have
ravished young and old,' and such like, which have appeared in the
Indian papers and been copied from them into the English ones, are
malicious forgeries, and were written on the walls after the
re-occupation of Cawnpore by General Outram's and Havelock's forces.Although I was not there myself, I have spoken with many who were there,
and I know that what I tell you is true."I then asked him if he could give me any idea of the reason that had led
the Nana to order the commission of such a cold-blooded, cowardly crime."Asiatics," he said, "are weak, and their promises are not to be relied
on, but that springs more from indifference to obligations than from
prearranged treachery.When they make promises, they intend to keep
them; but when they find them inconvenient, they choose to forget them.And so it was, I believe, with the Nana Sahib.He intended to have
spared the women and children, but they had an enemy in his _zenana_ in
the person of a female fiend who had formerly been a slave-girl, and
there were many about the Nana (Azeemoolla Khan for one) who wished to
see him so irretrievably implicated in rebellion that there would be no
possibility for him to draw back.So this woman was powerfully supported
in her evil counsel, and obtained permission to have the English ladies
killed; and after the sepoys of the Sixth Native Infantry and the Nana's
own guard had refused to do the horrible work, this woman went and
procured the wretches who did it.This information I have from General
Tantia Topee, who quarrelled with the Nana on this same matter.What I
tell you is true: the murder of the European women and children at
Cawnpore was a woman's crime, for there is no fiend equal to a female
fiend; but what cause she had for enmity against the unfortunate ladies
I don't know--I never inquired."Those of my readers who were in India at the time may remember that
something about this slave-girl was said in all the native evidence
collected at the time on the subject of the Cawnpore massacre.I next asked Mahomed Ali Khan if he knew whether there was any truth in
the stories about General Wheeler's daughter having shot four or five
men with a revolver, and then leaped into the well at Cawnpore."All
these stories," was his answer, "are pure inventions with no foundation
of truth.General Wheeler's daughter is still alive, and is now in
Lucknow; she has become a Mussulmanee, and has married according to
Mahommedan law the man who protected her; whether she may ever return to
her own people I know not."In such conversation I passed the night with my prisoner, and towards
daybreak I permitted him to perform his ablutions and morning devotions,
after which he once more thanked me, and prayed that Allah might reward
me for my kindness to His oppressed servant.Once, and only once, did he
show any weakness, in alluding to his wife and two boys in their faraway
home in Rohilcund, when he remarked that they would never know the fate
of their unfortunate father.But he at once checked himself, saying, "I
have read French history as well as English; I must remember Danton, and
show no weakness."He then produced a gold ring which was concealed
among his hair, and asked me if I would accept it and keep it in
remembrance of him, in token of his gratitude.It was, he said, the only
thing he could give me, as everything of value had been taken from him
when he was arrested.He went on to say that the ring in question was
only a common one, not worth more than ten rupees, but that it had been
given to him by a holy man in Constantinople as a talisman, though the
charm had been broken when he had joined the unlucky man who was his
fellow-prisoner.I accepted the ring, which he placed on my finger with
a blessing and a prayer for my preservation, and he told me to look on
it and remember Mahomed Khan when I was in front of the fortifications
of Lucknow, and no evil would befall me.He had hardly finished speaking
when a guard from the provost-marshal came with an order to take over
the prisoners, and I handed this man over with a sincere feeling of pity
for his fate.Immediately after, I received orders that the division would march at
sunrise for Lucknow, and that my party was to join the rear-guard, after
the ammunition-park and siege-train had moved on.The sun was high in
the heavens before we left the encamping-ground, and in passing under a
tree on the side of the Cawnpore and Lucknow road, I looked up, and was
horrified to see my late prisoner and his companion hanging stark and
stiffened corpses!I could hardly repress a tear as I passed.But on the
11th of March, in the assault on the Begum's Kothee, I remembered
Mahomed Ali Khan and looked on the ring.I am thankful to say that I
went through the rest of the campaign without a scratch, and the
thoughts of my kindness to this unfortunate man certainly did not
inspire me with any desire to shirk danger.I still have the ring, the
only piece of Mutiny plunder I ever possessed, and shall hand it down to
my children together with the history of Mahomed Ali Khan.FOOTNOTES:

[37] Butler.[38] It must also be remembered that these officials knew much more of
the terrible facts attending the Mutiny--of the wholesale murder (and
even worse) of English women and the slaughter of English children--than
the rank and file were permitted to hear; and that they were also, both
from their station and their experience, far better able to decide the
measures best calculated to crush the imminent danger threatening our
dominion in India.Among the sepoys the word usually signified an Afghan or
Caubuli.[41] This very man who denounced Jamie Green as a spy was actually
hanged in Bareilly in the following May for having murdered his master
in that station when the Mutiny first broke out.CHAPTER XI

THE SIEGE OF LUCKNOW--SIR COLIN APPOINTED COLONEL OF THE NINETY-THIRD
--ASSAULT ON THE MARTINIERE--A "RANK" JOKE.After leaving Oonao our division under Sir Edward Lugard reached
Buntera, six miles from the Alumbagh, on the 27th of February, and
halted there till the 2nd of March, when we marched to the Dilkoosha,
encamping a short distance from the palace barely beyond reach of the
enemy's guns, for they were able at times to throw round-shot into our
camp.We then settled down for the siege and capture of Lucknow; but the
work before us was considered tame and unimportant when compared with
that of the relief of the previous November.Every soldier in the camp
clearly recognised that the capture of the doomed city was simply a
matter of time,--a few days more or less--and the task before us a mere
matter of routine, nothing to be compared to the exciting exertions
which we had to put forth for the relief of our countrywomen and their
children.At the time of the annexation of Oude Lucknow was estimated to contain
from eight to nine hundred thousand inhabitants, or as many as Delhi and
Benares put together.The camp and bazaars of our force were full of
reports of the great strength and determination of the enemy, and
certainly all the chiefs of Oude, Mahommedan and Hindoo, had joined the
standard of the Begum and had sworn to fight for their young king Brijis
Kuddur.All Oude was therefore still against us, and we held only the
ground covered by the British guns.Bazaar reports estimated the enemy's
strength at from two hundred and fifty to three hundred thousand
fighting men, with five hundred guns in position; but in the
Commander-in-Chief's camp the strength of the enemy was computed at
sixty thousand regulars, mutineers who had lately served the Company,
and about seventy thousand irregulars, matchlock-men, armed police,
dacoits, etc., making a total of one hundred and thirty thousand
fighting men.To fight this large army, sheltered behind entrenchments
and loophooled walls, the British force, even after being joined by Jung
Bahadoor's Goorkhas, mustered only about thirty-one thousand men of all
arms, and one hundred and sixty-four guns.From the heights of the Dilkoosha in the cool of the early morning,
Lucknow, with its numerous domed mosques, minarets, and palaces, looked
very picturesque.I don't think I ever saw a prettier scene than that
presented on the morning of the 3rd of March, 1858, when the sun rose,
and Captain Peel and his Blue-jackets were getting their heavy guns,
68-pounders, into position.From the Dilkoosha, even without the aid of
telescopes, we could see that the defences had been greatly
strengthened since we retired from Lucknow in November, and I called to
mind the warning of Jamie Green, that if the enemy stood to their guns
like men behind those extensive earthworks, many of the British force
would lose the number of their mess before we could take the city; and
although the Indian papers which reached our camp affected to sneer at
the Begum, Huzrut Mahal, and the legitimacy of her son Brijis Kuddur,
whom the mutineers had proclaimed King of Oude, they had evidently the
support of the whole country, for every chief and _zemindar_ of any
importance had joined them.On the morning after we had pitched our camp in the Dilkoosha park, I
went out with Sergeant Peter Gillespie, our deputy provost-marshal, to
take a look round the bazaars, and just as we turned a corner on our way
back to camp, we met some gentlemen in civilian dress, one of whom
turned out to be Mr.Russell, the _Times'_ correspondent, whom we never
expected to have seen in India.I never did think of meeting you here,
but I am right glad to see you, and so will all our boys be!"After a
short chat and a few inquiries about the regiment, Mr.Russell asked
when we expected to be in Lucknow, to which Peter Gillespie replied:
"Well, I dinna ken, sir, but when Sir Colin likes to give the order,
we'll just advance and take it."I may here mention that Sergeant
Gillespie lived to go through the Mutiny, and the cholera epidemic in
Peshawar in 1862, only to die of hydrophobia from the bite of a pet dog
in Sialkote years after, when he was about to retire on his sergeant's
pension.I mention this because Peter Gillespie was a well-known
character in the old regiment; he had served on the staff of the
provost-marshal throughout the Crimean war, and, so far as I now
remember, Colonel Ewart and Sergeant Gillespie were the only two men in
the regiment who gained the Crimean medal with the four clasps, for
Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman, and Sebastopol.On the 4th of March the Ninety-Third, a squadron of the Ninth Lancers,
and a battery of artillery, were marched to the banks of the Goomtee
opposite Beebeepore House, to form a guard for the engineers engaged in
throwing a pontoon bridge across the Goomtee.The weather was now very
hot in the day-time, and as we were well beyond the range of the enemy's
guns, we were allowed to undress by companies and bathe in the river.As
far as I can remember, we were two days on this duty.During the
forenoon of the second day the Commander-in-Chief visited us, and the
regiment fell in to receive him, because, he said, he had something of
importance to communicate.When formed up, Sir Colin told us that he had
just received despatches from home, and among them a letter from the
Queen in which the Ninety-Third was specially mentioned.He then pulled
the letter out of his pocket, and read the paragraph alluded to, which
ran as follows, as nearly as I remembered to note it down after it was
read: "The Queen wishes Sir Colin to convey the expression of her great
admiration and gratitude to all European as well as native troops who
have fought so nobly and so gallantly for the relief of Lucknow, amongst
whom the Queen is rejoiced to see the Ninety-Third Highlanders."Colonel
Leith-Hay at once called for three cheers for her Majesty the Queen,
which were given with hearty good-will, followed by three more for the
Commander-in-Chief.The colonel then requested Sir Colin to return the
thanks of the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the
regiment to her Majesty the Queen for her most gracious message, and for
her special mention of the Ninety-Third, an honour which no one serving
in the regiment would ever forget.To this Sir Colin replied that
nothing would give him greater pleasure than to comply with this
request; but he had still more news to communicate.He had also a letter
from his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge to read to us, which he
proceeded to do as follows: "One line in addition to my letter addressed
to you this morning, to say that, in consequence of the Colonelcy of the
Ninety-Third Highlanders having become vacant by the death of General
Parkinson, I have recommended the Queen to remove you to the command of
that distinguished and gallant corps, with which you have been so much
associated, not alone at the present moment in India, but also during
the whole of the campaign in the Crimea.I thought such an arrangement
would be agreeable to yourself, and I know that it is the highest
compliment that her Majesty could pay to the Ninety-Third Highlanders to
see their dear old chief at their head."As soon as Sir Colin had read
this letter, the whole regiment cheered till we were hoarse; and when
Sir Colin's voice could again be heard, he called for the master-tailor
to go to the headquarters camp to take his measure to send home for a
uniform of the regiment for him, feather bonnet and all complete; and
about eighteen months afterwards Sir Colin visited us in Subathoo,
dressed in the regimental uniform then ordered.Early on the 7th of March General Outram's division crossed the Goomtee
by the bridge of boats, and we returned to our tents at the Dilkoosha.About mid-day we could see Outram's division, of which the Seventy-Ninth
Cameron Highlanders formed one of the infantry corps, driving the enemy
before them in beautiful style.We saw also the Queen's Bays, in their
bright scarlet uniform and brass helmets, make a splendid charge,
scattering the enemy like sheep, somewhere about the place where the
buildings of the Upper India Paper Mills now stand.In this charge Major
Percy Smith and several men galloped right through the enemy's lines,
and were surrounded and killed.Spies reported that Major Smith's head
was cut off, and, with his helmet, plume, and uniform, paraded through
the streets of Lucknow as the head of the Commander-in-Chief.But the
triumph of the enemy was short.On the 8th General Outram was firmly
established on the north bank of the Goomtee, with a siege-train of
twenty-two heavy guns, with which he completely turned and enfiladed the
enemy's strong position.On the 9th of March we were ordered to take our dinners at twelve
o'clock, and shortly after that hour our division, consisting of the
Thirty-Eighth, Forty-Second, Fifty-Third, Ninetieth, Ninety-Third, and
Fourth Punjab Infantry, was under arms, screened by the Dilkoosha palace
and the garden walls round it, and Peel's Blue-jackets were pouring shot
and shell, with now and again a rocket, into the Martiniere as fast as
ever they could load.About two o'clock the order was given for the
advance--the Forty-Second to lead and the Ninety-Third to support; but
we no sooner emerged from the shelter of the palace and garden-walls
than the orderly advance became a rushing torrent.Both regiments dashed
down the <DW72> abreast, and the earthworks, trenches, and rifle-pits in
front of the Martiniere were cleared, the enemy flying before us as fast
as their legs could carry them.We pursued them right through the
gardens, capturing their first line of works along the canal in front of
Banks's bungalow and the Begum's palace.There we halted for the night,
our heavy guns and mortar-batteries being advanced from the Dilkoosha;
and I, with some men from my company, was sent on piquet to a line of
unroofed huts in front of one of our mortar-batteries, for fear the
enemy from the Begum's palace might make a rush on the mortars.This
piquet was not relieved till the morning of the 11th, when I learned
that my company had been sent back as camp-guards, the captains of
companies having drawn lots for this service, as all were equally
anxious to take part in the assault on the Begum's palace, and it was
known the Ninety-Third were to form the storming-party.As soon as the
works should be breached, I and the men who were with me on the
advance-piquet were to be sent to join Captain M'Donald's company,
instead of going back to our own in camp.After being relieved from
piquet, our little party set about preparing some food.Our own company
having gone back to camp, no rations had been drawn for us, and our
haversacks were almost empty; so I will here relate a mild case of
cannibalism.Of the men of my own company who were with me on this
piquet one was Andrew M'Onvill,--Handy Andy, as he was called in the
regiment--a good-hearted, jolly fellow, and as full of fun and practical
jokes as his namesake, Lever's hero,--a thorough Paddy from Armagh, a
soldier as true as the steel of a Damascus blade or a Scotch Andrea
Ferrara.When last I heard of him, I may add, he was sergeant-major of a
New Zealand militia regiment.Others were Sandy Proctor, soldier-servant
to Dr.Munro, and George Patterson, the son of the carrier of Ballater
in Aberdeenshire.I forget who the rest were, but we were joined by John
M'Leod, the pipe-major, and one or two more.We got into an empty hut,
well sheltered from the bullets of the enemy, and Handy Andy sallied out
on a foraging expedition for something in the way of food.He had a
friend in the Fifty-Third who was connected in some way with the
quarter-master's department, and always well supplied with extra
provender.The Fifty-Third were on our right, and there Handy Andy found
his friend, and returned with a good big steak, cut from an artillery
gun-bullock which had been killed by a round-shot; also some sheep's
liver and a haversack full of biscuits, with plenty of pumpkin to make
a good stew.There was no lack of cooking-pots in the huts around, and
plenty of wood for fuel, so we kindled a fire, and very soon had an
excellent stew in preparation.But the enemy pitched some shells into
our position, and one burst close to a man named Tim Drury, a big stout
fellow, killing him on the spot.I forget now which company he belonged
to, but his body lay where he fell, just outside our hut, with one thigh
nearly torn away.My readers must not for a moment think that such a
picture in the foreground took away our appetites in the least.There is
nothing like a campaign for making one callous and selfish, and
developing the qualities of the wild beast in one's nature; and the
thought which rises uppermost is--Well, it is his turn now, and it may
be mine next, and there is no use in being down-hearted!Our steak had
been broiled to a turn, and our stew almost cooked, when we noticed
tiffin and breakfast combined arrive for the European officers of the
Fourth Punjab Regiment, and some others who were waiting sheltered by
the walls of a roofless hut near where we were.Among them was a young
fellow, Lieutenant Fitzgerald Cologan, attached to some native regiment,
a great favourite with the Ninety-Third for his pluck.John M'Leod at
once proposed that Handy Andy should go and offer him half of our
broiled steak, and ask him for a couple of bottles of beer for our
dinner, as it might be the last time we should have the chance of
drinking his health.He and the other officers with him accepted the
steak with thanks, and Andy returned, to our no small joy, with two
quart bottles of Bass's beer.But, unfortunately he had attracted the
attention of Charley F., the greatest glutton in the Ninety-Third, who
was so well known for his greediness that no one would chum with him.Charley was a long-legged, humpbacked, cadaverous-faced, bald-headed
fellow, who had joined the regiment as a volunteer from the
Seventy-Second before we left Dover in the spring of 1857, and on
account of his long legs and humpback, combined with the inordinate
capacity of his stomach and an incurable habit of grumbling, he had been
re-christened the "Camel," before we had proceeded many marches with
that useful animal in India.Our mutual congratulations were barely over
on the acquisition of the two bottles of beer, when, to our
consternation, we saw the Camel dodging from cover to cover, as the
enemy were keeping up a heavy fire on our position, and if any one
exposed himself in the least, a shower of bullets was sent whistling
round him.However, the Camel, with a due regard to the wholeness of his
skin, steadily made way towards our hut.We all knew that if he were
admitted to a share of our stew, very little would be left for
ourselves.John M'Leod and I suggested that we should, at the risk of
quarrelling with him, refuse to allow him any share, but Handy Andy
said, "Leave him to me, and if a bullet doesn't knock him over as he
comes round the next corner, I'll put him off asking for a share of the
stew."Well, the Camel took good
care to dodge the bullets of Jack Pandy, and he no sooner reached a
sheltered place in front of the hut, than Andy called out: "Come along,
Charley, you are just in time; we got a slice of a nice steak from an
artillery-bullock this morning, and because it was too small alone for a
dinner for the four of us, we have just stewed it with a slice from Tim
Drury, and bedad it's first-rate!Tim tastes for all the world like
fresh pork"; and with that Andy picked out a piece of the sheep's liver
on the prongs of his fork, and offered it to Charley as part of Tim
Drury, at the same time requesting him not to mention the circumstance
to any one.This was too much for the Camel's stomach.He plainly
believed Andy, and turned away, as if he would be sick.However, he
recovered himself, and replied: "No, thank you; hungry as I am, it shall
never be in the power of any one to tell my auld mither in the Grass
Market o' Edinboro' that her Charley had become a cannibal!But if you
can spare me a drop of the beer I'll be thankful for it, for the sight
of your stew has made me feel unco' queer."We expressed our sorrow that
the beer was all drunk before we had seen Charley performing his oblique
advance, and Andy again pressed him to partake of a little of the stew;
but Charley refused to join, and sitting down in a sheltered spot in the
corner of our roofless mud-hut, made wry faces at the relish evinced by
the rest of us over our savoury stew.The Camel eventually discovered
that he had been made a fool of, and he never forgave us for cheating
him out of a share of the savoury mess.CHAPTER XII

ASSAULT ON THE BEGUM'S KOTHEE--DEATH OF CAPTAIN M'DONALD--MAJOR HODSON
WOUNDED--HIS DEATH


We had barely finished our meal when we noticed a stir among the
staff-officers, and a consultation taking place between General Sir
Edward Lugard, Brigadier Adrian Hope, and Colonel Napier.Suddenly the
order was given to the Ninety-Third to fall in.This was quietly done,
the officers taking their places, the men tightening their belts and
pressing their bonnets firmly on their heads, loosening the ammunition
in their pouches, and seeing that the springs of their bayonets held
tight.Thus we stood for a few seconds, when Brigadier Hope passed the
signal for the assault on the Begum's Kothee.Just before the signal was
given two men from the Fifty-Third rushed up to us with a soda-water
bottle full of grog.One of them was Lance-Corporal Robert Clary, who is
at present, I believe, police-sergeant in the Municipal Market,
Calcutta; the other was the friend of Andrew M'Onvill, who had supplied
us with the steaks for our "cannibal feast."I may mention that
Lance-Corporal Clary was the same man who led the party of the
Fifty-Third to capture the guns at the Kalee Nuddee bridge, and who
called out: "Three cheers for the Commander-in-Chief, boys," when Sir
Colin Campbell was threatening to send the regiment to the rear for
breach of orders.Clary was a County Limerick boy of the right sort,
such as filled the ranks of our Irish regiments of the old days.No
Fenian nor Home Ruler; but ever ready to uphold the honour of the
British Army by land or by sea, and to share the contents of his
haversack or his glass of grog with a comrade; one of those whom Scott
immortalises in _The Vision of Don Roderick_.from yon stately ranks what laughter rings,
      Mingling wild mirth with war's stern minstrelsy,
    His jest while each blithe comrade round him flings,
      And moves to death with military glee!tameless, frank, and free,
      In kindness warm, and fierce in danger known,
    Rough Nature's children, humorous as she.When Captain M'Donald, whose company we had joined, saw the two
Fifty-Third boys, he told them that they had better rejoin their own
regiment.Clary replied, "Sure, Captain, you don't mean it;" and seeing
Dr.Munro, our surgeon, busy giving directions to his assistants and
arranging bandages, etc., in a _dooly_, Clary went on:--"We have been
sent by Lieutenant Munro of our company to take care of his namesake
your doctor, who never thinks of himself, but is sure to be in the thick
of the fight, looking out for wounded men.You of the Ninety-Third don't
appreciate his worth.There's not another doctor in the army to equal
him or to replace him should he get knocked over in this scrimmage, and
we of the Fifty-Third have come to take care of him.""If that is the
case," said Captain M'Donald, "I'll allow you to remain; but you must
take care that no harm befalls our doctor, for he is a great friend of
mine."And with that Captain M'Donald stepped aside and plucked a rose
from a bush close by, (we were then formed up in what had been a
beautiful garden), and going up to Munro he gave him the flower saying,
"Good-bye, old friend, keep this for my sake."I have often recalled
this incident and wondered if poor Captain M'Donald had any presentiment
that he would be killed!Although he had been a captain for some years,
he was still almost a boy.He was a son of General Sir John M'Donald,
K.C.B., of Dalchosnie, Perthshire, and was wounded in his right arm
early in the day by a splinter from a shell, but he refused to go to the
rear, and remained at the head of his company, led it through the
breach, and was shot down just inside, two bullets striking him almost
at once, one right in his throat just over the breast-bone, as he was
waving his claymore and cheering on his company.After the fight was
over I made my way to where the dead were collected and cut off a lock
of his hair and sent it to a young lady, Miss M. E. Ainsworth, of
Inverighty House, Forfar, who, I knew, was acquainted with Captain
M'Donald's family.I intended the lock of hair for his mother, and I did
not know if his brother officers would think of sending any memento of
him.I don't know if ever the lock of hair reached his mother or not.When I went to do this I found Captain M'Donald's soldier-servant
crying beside the lifeless body of his late master, wringing his hands
and saying, "Oh!I never
saw a more girlish-looking face than his was in death; his features were
so regular, and looked strangely like those of a wax doll, which was, I
think, partly the effect of the wound in the throat.When Captain McDonald fell the company was led by the senior lieutenant,
and about twenty yards inside the breach in the outer rampart we were
stopped by a ditch nearly eighteen feet wide and at least twelve to
fourteen feet deep.It was easy enough to slide down to the bottom; the
difficulty was to get up on the other side!However, there was no
hesitation; the stormers dashed into the ditch, and running along to the
right in search of some place where we could get up on the inside, we
met part of the grenadier company headed by Lieutenant E. S. Wood, an
active and daring young officer.I may here mention that there were two
lieutenants of the name of Wood at this time in the Ninety-Third.One
belonged to my company; his name was S. E. Wood and he was severely
wounded at the relief of Lucknow and was, at the time of which I am
writing, absent from the regiment.The one to whom I now refer was
Lieutenant E. S. Wood of the grenadier company.When the two parties in
the ditch met, both in search of a place to get out, Mr.Wood got on the
shoulders of another grenadier and somehow scrambled up claymore in
hand.He was certainly the first man inside the inner works of the
Begum's palace, and when the enemy saw him emerge from the ditch they
fled to barricade doors and windows to prevent us getting into the
buildings.His action saved us, for the whole of us might have been shot
like rats in the ditch if they had attacked Mr.Wood, instead of flying
when they saw the tall grenadier claymore in hand.As soon as he saw the
coast clear the lieutenant lay down on the top of the ditch, and was
thus able to reach down and catch hold of the men's rifles by the bends
of the bayonets; and with the aid of the men below pushing up behind, we
were all soon pulled out of the ditch.When all were up, one of the men
turned to Mr.Wood and said: "If any officer in the regiment deserves to
get the Victoria Cross, sir, you do; for besides the risk you have run
from the bullets of the enemy, it's more than a miracle that you're not
shot by our own rifles; they're all on full-cock."Seizing loaded rifles on full-cock by the muzzles, and pulling more than
a score of men out of a deep ditch, was a dangerous thing to do; but no
one thought of the danger, nor did anyone think of even easing the
spring to half-cock, much less of firing his rifle off before being
pulled up.Wood escaped, and after getting his captaincy he
left the regiment and became Conservator of Forests in Oude.H. W. I. Wood, for
many years the well-known secretary to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce.He has just lately retired on his pension; I wonder if he ever recalls
the danger he incurred from pulling his men out of the ditch of the
Begum's palace by the muzzles of their loaded rifles on full-cock!By the time we got out of the ditch we found every door and window of
the palace buildings barricaded, and every loophole defended by an
invisible enemy.But one barrier after another was forced, and men in
small parties, headed by the officers, got possession of the inner
square, where the enemy in large numbers stood ready for the struggle.But no thought of unequal numbers held us back.The command was given:
"Keep well together, men, and use the bayonet; give them the
Secundrabagh and the sixteenth of November over again."It raged for about two hours from court to court,
and from room to room; the pipe-major, John M'Leod, playing the pipes
inside as calmly as if he had been walking round the officers' mess-tent
at a regimental festival.When all was over, General Sir Edward Lugard,
who commanded the division, complimented the pipe-major on his coolness
and bravery: "Ah, sir," said John, "I knew our boys would fight all the
better when cheered by the bagpipes.""Within about two hours from the time the signal for the assault was
given, over eight hundred and sixty of the enemy lay dead within the
inner court, and no quarter was sought or given.By this time we were
broken up in small parties in a series of separate fights, all over the
different detached buildings of the palace.Captain M'Donald being dead,
the men who had been on piquet with me joined a party under Lieutenant
Sergison, and while breaking in the door of a room, Mr.Sergison was
shot dead at my side with several men.When we had partly broken in the
door, I saw that there was a large number of the enemy inside the room,
well armed with swords and spears, in addition to fire-arms of all
sorts, and, not wishing to be either killed myself or have more of the
men who were with me killed, I divided my party, placing some at each
side of the door to shoot every man who showed himself, or attempted to
rush out.I then sent two men back to the breach, where I knew Colonel
Napier with his engineers were to be found, to get a few bags of
gunpowder with slow-matches fixed, to light and pitch into the room.Instead of finding Napier, the two men sent by me found the redoubtable
Major Hodson who had accompanied Napier as a volunteer in the storming
of the palace.Hodson did not wait for the powder-bags, but, after
showing the men where to go for them, came running up himself, sabre in
hand.I pointed to the door of the
room, and Hodson, shouting 'Come on!'I implored
him not to do so, saying, 'It's certain death; wait for the powder; I've
sent men for powder-bags,' Hodson made a step forward, and I put out my
hand to seize him by the shoulder to pull him out of the line of the
doorway, when he fell back shot through the chest.He gasped out a few
words, either 'Oh, my wife!'--I cannot now rightly
remember--but was immediately choked by blood.At the time I thought the
bullet had passed through his lungs, but since then I have seen the
memoir written by his brother, the Rev.George H. Hodson, Vicar of
Enfield, in which it is stated that the bullet passed through his liver.However, I assisted to get him lifted into a _dooly_ (by that time the
bearers had got in and were collecting the wounded who were unable to
walk), and I sent him back to where the surgeons were, fully expecting
that he would be dead before anything could be done for him.It will
thus be seen that the assertion that Major Hodson was looting when he
was killed is untrue.No looting had been commenced, not even by Jung
Bahadoor's Goorkhas.That Major Hodson was killed through his own
rashness cannot be denied; but for any one to say that he was looting is
a cruel slander on one of the bravest of Englishmen."Shortly after I had lifted poor Hodson into the _dooly_ and sent him
away in charge of his orderly, the two men who had gone for the powder
came up with several bags, with slow-matches fixed in them.These we
ignited, and then pitched the bags in through the door.Two or three
bags very soon brought the enemy out, and they were bayoneted down
without mercy.One of the men who were with me was, I think, Mr.Rule,
who is now _sans_ a leg, and employed by the G.I.P.Railway in Bombay,
but was then a powerful young man of the light company.Rule rushed in
among the rebels, using both bayonet and butt of his rifle, shouting,
"Revenge for the death of Hodson!"and he killed more than half the men
single-handed.By this time we had been over two hours inside the
breach, and almost all opposition had ceased.Lieutenant and Adjutant
"Willie" MacBean, as he was known to the officers, and "Paddy" MacBean
to the men, encountered a _havildar_, a _naik_, and nine sepoys at one
gate, and killed the whole eleven, one after the other.The _havildar_
was the last; and by the time he got out through the narrow gate,
several men came to the assistance of MacBean, but he called to them not
to interfere, and the _havildar_ and he went at it with their swords.At
length MacBean made a feint cut, but instead gave the point, and put his
sword through the chest of his opponent.For this MacBean got the
Victoria Cross, mainly, I believe, because Sir Edward Lugard, the
general in command of the division, was looking down from the ramparts
above and saw the whole affair.I don't think that MacBean himself
thought he had done anything extraordinary.He was an Inverness-shire
ploughman before he enlisted, and rose from the ranks to command the
regiment, and died a major-general.There were still a number of old
soldiers in the regiment who had been privates with MacBean when I
enlisted, and many anecdotes were related about him.One of these was
that when MacBean first joined, he walked with a rolling gait, and the
drill-corporal was rather abusive with him when learning his drill.At
last he became so offensive that another recruit proposed to MacBean,
who was a very powerful man, that they should call the corporal behind
the canteen in the barrack-yard and give him a good thrashing, to which
proposal MacBean replied: "Toots, toots, man, that would never do.I am
going to command this regiment before I leave it, and it would be an ill
beginning to be brought before the colonel for thrashing the
drill-corporal!"MacBean kept to his purpose, and _did_ live to command
the regiment, going through every rank from private to major-general.I
have seen it stated that he was a drummer-boy in the regiment, but that
is not correct.He was kept seven years lance-corporal, partly because
promotion went slow in the Ninety-Third, but several were promoted over
him because, at the time of the disruption in the Church of Scotland,
MacBean joined the Free Kirk party.This fact may appear strange to
military readers of the present day with our short service and
territorial regiments; but in the times of which I am writing, as I have
before mentioned, the Ninety-Third was constituted as much after the
arrangements of a Highland parish as those of a regiment in the army;
and, to use the words of old Colonel Sparks who commanded, MacBean was
passed over four promotions because "He was a d--d Free Kirker."But I must hark back to my story and to the Begum's palace on the
evening of the 11th of March, 1858.By the time darkness set in all
opposition had ceased, but there were still numbers of the mutineers
hiding in the rooms.Our loss was small compared with that inflicted on
the enemy.Our regiment had one captain, one lieutenant, and thirteen
rank and file killed; Lieutenant Grimston, Ensign Hastie, and
forty-five men wounded.Many of the wounded died afterwards; but eight
hundred and sixty of the enemy lay dead in the centre court alone, and
many hundreds more were killed in the different enclosures and
buildings.That night we bivouacked in the courts of the palace, placing
strong guards all round.When daylight broke on the morning of the 12th
of March, the sights around were horrible.I have already mentioned that
many sepoys had to be dislodged from the close rooms around the palace
by exploding bags of gunpowder among them, and this set fire to their
clothing and to whatever furniture there was in the rooms; and when day
broke on the 12th, there were hundreds of bodies all round, some still
burning and others half-burnt, and the stench was sickening.However,
the Begum's palace was the key to the enemy's position.During the day
large parties of camp-followers were brought in to drag out the dead of
the enemy, and throw them into the ditch which had given us so much
trouble to cross, and our batteries were advanced to bombard the
Imambara and Kaiserbagh.During the forenoon of the 12th, I remember seeing Mr.Russell of _The
Times_ going round making notes, and General Lugard telling him to take
care and not to attempt to go into any dark room for fear of being
"potted" by concealed Pandies.Many such were hunted out during the day,
and as there was no quarter for them they fought desperately.We had
one sergeant killed at this work and several men wounded.During the
afternoon a divisional order by General Sir Edward Lugard was read to
us, as follows:--

"Major-General Sir Edward Lugard begs to thank Brigadier the Honourable
Adrian Hope, Colonel Leith-Hay, and the officers and men of the
Ninety-Third who exclusively carried the position known as the Begum's
Kothee.No words are sufficient to express the gallantry, devotion, and
fearless intrepidity displayed by every officer and man in the regiment.The Major-General will not fail to bring their conduct prominently to
the notice of his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief."During the day Sir Colin himself visited the position, and told us that
arrangements would be made for our relief the following day, and on
Saturday, the 13th, we returned to camp and rested all the following
Sunday.So far as I remember, the two men of the Fifty-Third,
Lance-Corporal Clary and his comrade, remained with us till after the
place was taken, and then returned to their own regiment when the
fighting was over, reporting to Lieutenant Munro that they had gone to
take care of his brother, Doctor Munro of the Ninety-Third.There were many individual acts of bravery performed during the assault,
and it is difficult to single them out.But before closing this chapter
I may relate a rather laughable incident that happened to a man of my
company named Johnny Ross.He was a little fellow, and there were two
of the same name in the company, one tall and the other short, so they
were named respectively John and Johnny.Before falling in for the
assault on the Begum's palace, Johnny Ross and George Puller, with some
others, had been playing cards in a sheltered corner, and in some way
quarrelled over the game.When the signal was given for the "fall in,"
Puller and Ross were still arguing the point in dispute, and Puller told
Ross to "shut up."Just at that very moment a spent bullet struck Ross
in the mouth, knocking in four of his front teeth.Johnny thought it was
Puller who had struck him, and at once returned the blow; when Puller
quietly replied, "You d--d fool, it was not I who struck you; you've got
a bullet in your mouth."And so it was: Johnny Ross put up his hand to
his mouth, and spat out four front teeth and a leaden bullet.He at once
apologised to Puller for having struck him, and added, "How will I
manage to bite my cartridges the noo?"Those were the days of
muzzle-loading cartridges, which had to be torn open with the teeth when
loading.We returned to our tents at the Dilkoosha on Saturday, the 13th, and the
whole regiment formed a funeral party for our killed near the palace;
but I could not find the place on my late visit to Lucknow, nor do I
think any monument marks it.When going round the Dilkoosha heights I
found no trace of the graves of the Ninety-Third, nor was there any one
who could point them out to me.The guide took me to see the grave of
Major Hodson.I found it in excellent preservation, with a wall round
it, and an iron gate to it near the entrance to the Martiniere College.This care had been taken of Hodson's last resting-place by his friend,
Lord Napier of Magdala, and I cut a branch from the cypress-tree planted
at his head, and posted half of it to the address of his brother in
England.NOTE

HODSON OF HODSON'S HORSE

      Sir Colin Campbell wrote thus at the time of Major Hodson's
      death: "The whole army, which admired his talents, his
      bravery, and his military skill, deplores his loss.... I
      attended his funeral yesterday evening, in order to show
      what respect I could to the memory of one of the most
      brilliant officers under my command.--(Signed) C.
      CAMPBELL, Commander-in-Chief in East Indies."The following tributes were also paid to Hodson's memory at
      the time.From a leading article in _The Times_: "The
      country will receive with lively regret the news that the
      gallant Major Hodson, who has given his name to an
      invincible and almost ubiquitous body of cavalry, was killed
      in the attack on Lucknow.Major Hodson has been from the
      very beginning of this war fighting everywhere and against
      any odds with all the spirit of a Paladin of old.His most
      remarkable exploit, the capture of the King of Delhi and his
      two sons, astonished the world by its courage and coolness.Hodson was indeed a man who, from his romantic daring and
      his knowledge of the Asiatic character, was able to beat the
      natives at their own weapons."From _Blackwood's Magazine_: "Then fell one of the bravest
      in the Indian Army, an officer whose name has been brought
      too often before the public by those in high command to need
      my humble word of praise.There was not a man before Delhi
      who did not know Hodson; always active, always cheery, it
      did one's heart good to look at his face when all felt how
      critical was our position."CHAPTER XIII

JUNG BAHADOOR--GUNPOWDER--THE MOHURRUM AT LUCKNOW--LOOT


On the return of the regiment to camp at the Dilkoosha on the 13th of
March I was glad to get back to my own company.The men were mortified
because they had not shared in the honour of the assault on the Begum's
palace; but as some compensation the company had formed the
guard-of-honour for the reception of the Maharaja Jung Bahadoor,
Commander-in-Chief of the Nepaulese Army, who had just reached Lucknow
and been received in state by Sir Colin Campbell on the afternoon of the
11th, at the moment when the regiment was engaged in the assault on the
palace.The _durbar_ had at first proved a rather stiff ceremonial
affair, but Jung Bahadoor and his officers had hardly been presented and
taken their seats, when a commotion was heard outside, and Captain Hope
Johnstone, aide-de-camp to General Sir William Mansfield, covered with
powder-smoke and the dust of battle, strode up the centre of the
guard-of-honour with a message to the Commander-in-Chief from Mansfield,
informing him that the Ninety-Third had taken the Begum's palace, the
key of the enemy's position, with slight loss to themselves, but that
they had killed over a thousand of the enemy.This announcement put an
end to all ceremony on the part of Sir Colin, who jumped to his feet,
rubbing his hands, and calling out, "I knew they would do it!I knew my
boys of the Ninety-Third would do it!"Then telling Captain Metcalfe to
interpret the news to the Maharaja, and pointing to the guard-of-honour,
Sir Colin said: "Tell him that these men are part of the regiment that
has done this daring feat.Tell him also that they are _my_ regiment;
I'm their colonel!"The Maharaja looked pleased, and replied that he
remembered having seen the regiment when he visited England in 1852.As
I have already said, the Ninety-Third had formed a guard-of-honour for
him when in Edinburgh, and there were still many men in the regiment who
remembered seeing Jung Bahadoor.There was an oft-repeated story among
the old soldiers that the Maharaja was so pleased at the sight of them
that he had proposed to buy the whole regiment, and was somewhat
surprised to learn that British soldiers were volunteers and could not
be sold, even to gratify the Maharaja of Nepaul.After returning to camp on the 13th of March, the regiment was allowed
to rest till the 17th, but returned to the city on the morning of the
18th, taking up a position near the Imambara and the Kaiserbagh, both of
which had been captured when we were in camp.We relieved the
Forty-Second, and the sights that then met our eyes in the streets of
Lucknow defy description.The city was in the hands of plunderers;
Europeans and Sikhs, Goorkhas, and camp-followers of every class, aided
by the scum of the native population.Every man in fact was doing what
was right in his own eyes, and "Hell broke loose" is the only phrase in
the English language that can give one who has never seen such a sight
any idea of the scenes in and around the Imambara, the Kaiserbagh, and
adjacent streets.The Sikhs and Goorkhas were by far the most proficient
plunderers, because they instinctively knew where to look for the most
valuable loot.The European soldiers did not understand the business,
and articles that might have proved a fortune to many were readily
parted with for a few rupees in cash and a bottle of grog.But the
gratuitous destruction of valuable property that could not be carried
off was appalling.Colour-Sergeant Graham, of Captain Burroughs'
company, rescued from the fire a bundle of Government-of-India
promissory notes to the value of over a _lakh_ of rupees,[42] and Mr.Mary went back to the bedroom.Kavanagh, afterwards discovering the rightful owner, secured for
Sergeant Graham a reward of five per cent on the amount.But with few
exceptions the men of the Ninety-Third got very little.I could fill a
volume on the plunder of Lucknow, and the sights which are still vividly
impressed on my memory; but others have written at length on this theme,
so I will leave it.Before I proceed to other subjects, and to make my recollections as
instructive as possible for young soldiers, I may mention some serious
accidents that happened through the explosions of gunpowder left behind
by the enemy.One most appalling accident occurred in the house of a
nobleman named Ushruf-ood-dowlah, in which a large quantity of gunpowder
had been left; this was accidentally exploded, killing two officers and
forty men of the Engineers, and a great number of camp-followers, of
whom no account was taken.The poor men who were not killed outright
were so horribly scorched that they all died in the greatest agony
within a few hours of the accident, and for days explosions with more or
less loss of life occurred all over the city.From the deplorable
accidents that happened, which reasonable care might have prevented, I
could enumerate the loss of over a hundred men, and I cannot too
strongly impress on young soldiers the caution required in entering
places where there is the least chance of coming across concealed
gunpowder.By the accident in the house of Ushruf-ood-dowlah, two of our
most distinguished and promising Engineer officers,--Captains Brownlow
and Clarke--lost their lives, with forty of the most valuable branch of
the service.All through the Mutiny I never forgot my own experience in
the Shah Nujeef (as related in the fifth chapter of these
reminiscences); and wherever I could prevent it, I never allowed men to
go into unexplored rooms with lighted pipes, or to force open locked
doors by the usual method of firing a loaded rifle into the lock.I
think there ought to be a chapter of instructions on this head in every
drill-book and soldiers' pocket-book.After the assault on a city like
Lucknow some license and plundering is inevitable, and where discipline
is relaxed accidents are sure to happen; but a judicious use of the
provost-marshal's cat would soon restore discipline and order.Whatever
opponents of the lash may say, my own firm opinion is that the
provost-marshal's cat is the only general to restore order in times like
those I am describing.I would have no courts-martial, drum-head or
otherwise; but simply give the provost-marshal a strong guard of picked
men and several sets of triangles, with full power to tie up every man,
no matter what his rank, caught plundering, and give him from one to
four dozen, not across the shoulders, but across the breech, as judicial
floggings are administered in our jails; and if these were combined with
roll-calls at short intervals, plundering, which is a most dangerous
pastime, would soon be put down.In time of war soldiers ought to be
taught to treat every house or room of an assaulted position as a
powder-magazine until explored.I am surprised that cautions on this
head have been so long overlooked.As before stated, the Ninety-Third did not get much plunder, but in
expelling the enemy from some mosques and other strong buildings near
the Imambara on the 21st of March, one company came across the
tomb-model or royal _tazia_, and the Mohurrum paraphernalia which had
been made at enormous expense for the celebration of the last Mohurrum
in Lucknow in 1857.The royal family and court of Lucknow were
_Sheeahs_: and to enable European readers to understand the value of
the plunder to which I allude, before entering on the actual details, I
will quote from the chapter on the celebration of the Mohurrum in
Lucknow in _The Private Life of an Eastern King_, by William Knighton, a
member of the household of his late Majesty Nussir-ood-Deen King of
Oude, a book which, I believe, is now out of print.Few people seem to
know the meaning of those symbols, the star and crescent or half-moon,
on Mahommedan standards or banners and on the domes of mosques or tombs
of deceased persons of importance, as also on the tomb-models, or
_tazias_ used in the celebration of the Mohurrum.For the explanation of
these symbols we must turn to the science of heraldry, which was well
known in the sixth century A.D., when Mahommed established his
religion.The star is meant to represent Mahommed himself, as the
prophet of God, and the crescent represents the Mahommedan religion,
which every sincere follower of the Prophet believes will eventually
become a full moon and cover the whole earth.The fanatical rites of the Mohurrum are celebrated on the
      anniversary of the death of two leaders of the faithful,
      near relatives of Mahommed himself, Hussun and Hoosein, and
      are observed by more than one-half the population of India
      as a period of deep humiliation and sorrow.The Mussulman
      faithful are divided into two sects, Sheeahs and the
      Soonies, who feel towards each other much as fanatical
      Protestants and Roman Catholics mutually do.The Sheeahs
      regard the deaths of Hussun and Hoosein as barbarous
      murders; the Soonies look on them as lawful executions of
      pretenders to supreme power by the reigning Caliph, the true
      head of the faithful.On the first day of the Mohurrum the
      vast population of Lucknow appears to be suddenly snatched
      away from all interests and employments in the affairs of
      this world; the streets are deserted; every one is shut up
      in his house, mourning with his family.On the second day
      the streets are crowded, but with people in mourning attire,
      parading the thoroughfares in funeral procession to the
      tomb-models set up here and there as tributes of respect to
      the memory of Hussun and Hoosein.These models, called
      _tazias_, are representations of the mausoleum at Kerbela
      where the two chiefs are buried.The _tazias_ are placed in
      an _imambara_ belonging to a chief, or in the house of some
      wealthy Mussulman.The _tazia_ belonging to the king of Oude
      was made for his Majesty's father, and was composed of
      panels of green glass fixed in gold mouldings, and was
      regarded as peculiarly holy.[I only take extracts from the
      chapter on the Mohurrum from the work I have named.The
      _tazia_ belonging to the king accompanied him from Lucknow
      on the annexation of Oude.]It is on record at Lucknow that
      the celebration of the Mohurrum often cost a reigning Nawab
      upwards of L300,000 or Rs.In Lucknow, before the
      Mutiny, it was believed that they had the true metal crest
      of the banner of Hoosein, a relic regarded as peculiarly
      sacred, and enshrined in a building called the Doorgah.The
      name of the charger which Hoosein rode when he was killed
      was Dhulldhull, represented in the procession of the
      Mohurrum by a spotless white Arab of elegant proportions.The trappings of Dhulldhull are all of solid gold, and a
      golden bow and quiver of arrows are fixed on the saddle.These extracts from a history of Lucknow before the Mutiny will enable
my readers to form some idea of the splendour of the Mohurrum of 1857,
and the value of the _tazia_ and paraphernalia found, as I said, by a
company of the Ninety-Third.I learned from native troopers that the
golden _tazia_ belonging to the crown jewels of Lucknow having
accompanied the king to Calcutta, a new one was made, for which the
Mahommedan population of Lucknow subscribed _lakhs_ of rupees.In the
eleventh chapter of his _Defence of the Residency_, Mr.L. E. R. Rees
states that the Mohurrum was celebrated with unusual splendour and
fanaticism, commencing that year on the 25th of August, and that on the
_kutal-ka-rath_, or night of slaughter, a certain Mr.Jones, with ten
other Christians, deserted to the enemy by undoing a barricaded door
when one of their own number was on sentry over it.But, instead of a
favourable reception as they anticipated, the deserters received the
fitting reward of their treachery from the insurgents; for they were all
immediately killed as a sacrifice, and their blood sprinkled on the
different _tazias_ throughout the city.To return to my own story; I was
told by a native jeweller, who was in Lucknow in 1857, that the crescent
and star alone of the new _tazia_ made for the young king, Brijis
Kuddur, cost five _lakhs_ of rupees.Be that as it may, it fell to a
company of the Ninety-Third to assault the Doorgah, where all this
consecrated paraphernalia was stored, and there they found this golden
_tazia_, with all the gold-embroidered standards, saddle, and
saddle-cloth, the gold quiver and arrows of Dhulldhull.There was at the
time I write, a certain lieutenant in the company whom I shall call
Jamie Blank.He was known to be very poor, and it was reported in the
regiment that he used to regularly remit half of his lieutenant's pay to
support a widowed mother and a sister, and this fact made the men of the
company consider Jamie Blank entitled to a share in the loot.So when
the _tazia_ was discovered, not being very sure whether the diamonds in
the crescent and star on the dome were real or imitation, they settled
to cut off the whole dome, and give it to Jamie; which they did.I don't
know where Jamie Blank disposed of this particular piece of loot, but I
was informed that it eventually found its way to London, and was sold
for L80,000.The best part of the story is, however, to come.There was
a certain newspaper correspondent in the camp (not Mr.Russell), who
depended on his native servant to translate Hindoostanee names into
English.When he heard that a company of the Ninety-Third had found a
gold _tazia_ of great value, and that they had presented the senior
lieutenant with the lid of it to enable him to deposit money to purchase
his captaincy, the correspondent asked his Madrassi servant the English
equivalent for _tazia_.Samuel, perhaps not knowing the English word
_tomb_, but knowing that the _tazia_ referred to a funeral, told his
master that the English for _tazia_ was _coffin_; so it went the round
of the English papers that among the plunder of Lucknow a certain
company of the Ninety-Third had found a gold coffin, and that they had
generously presented the senior lieutenant with the lid of it, which was
studded with diamonds and other precious stones.So far as I am aware,
this is the first time that the true explanation of Jamie Blank's golden
coffin-lid has been given to the world.As already mentioned, with the exception of the company which captured
the golden _tazia_ and the Mohurrum paraphernalia, the Ninety-Third got
very little loot; and by the time we returned to the city order was in
some measure restored, prize-agents appointed, and guards placed at the
different thoroughfares to intercept camp-followers and other plunderers
on their way back to camp, who were thus made to disgorge their
plunder, nominally for the public good or the benefit of the army.But
it was shrewdly suspected by the troops that certain small caskets in
battered cases, which contained the redemption of mortgaged estates in
Scotland, England, and Ireland, and snug fishing and shooting-boxes in
every game-haunted and salmon-frequented angle of the world, found their
way inside the uniform-cases of even the prize-agents.I could myself
name one deeply-encumbered estate which was cleared of mortgage to the
tune of L180,000 within two years of the plunder of Lucknow.I only wish I had to go through a similar campaign with the
experience I have now.But that is all very fine thirty-five years
after!"There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the
flood"--my readers know the rest.I missed the flood, and the tide is
not likely to turn my way again.Before we left Lucknow the plunder
accumulated by the prize-agents was estimated at over L600,000
(according to _The Times_ of 31st of May, 1858), and within a week it
had reached a million and a quarter sterling.Each private soldier who served throughout the relief and capture of
Lucknow got prize-money to the value of Rs.17.8; but the thirty _lakhs_
of treasure which were found in the well at Bithoor, leaving the plunder
of the Nana Sahib's palace out of the calculation, much more than
covered that amount.Yet I could myself name over a dozen men who served
throughout every engagement, two of whom gained the Victoria Cross, who
have died in the almshouse of their native parishes, and several in the
almshouse of the Calcutta District Charitable Society!But enough of
moralising; I must get back to 1858.Many camp-followers and others managed to evade the guards, and
cavalry-patrols were put on duty along the different routes on both
banks of the Goomtee and in the wider thoroughfares of Lucknow.In my last chapter I gave it as my opinion that the provost-marshal's
cat is the only general which can put a stop to plundering and restore
order in times like those I describe, or rather I should say, _which I
cannot_ describe, because it is impossible to find words to depict the
scenes which met one's eyes at every turn in the streets of Lucknow.In
and around Huzrutgunge, the Imambara, and Kaiserbagh mad riot and chaos
reigned,--sights fit only for the Inferno.I had heard the phrase "drunk
with plunder"; I then saw it illustrated in real earnest.Soldiers mad
with pillage and wild with excitement, followed by crowds of
camp-followers too cowardly to go to the front, but as ravenous as the
vultures which followed the army and preyed on the carcases of the
slain.I have already said that many of the enemy had to be dislodged
from close rooms by throwing in bags of gunpowder with slow matches
fixed to them."When these exploded they set fire to clothing,
cotton-padded quilts, and other furniture in the rooms; and the
consequence was that in the inner apartments of the palaces there were
hundreds of dead bodies half burnt; many wounded were burnt alive with
the dead, and the stench from such rooms was horrible!Historians tell
us that Charles the Ninth of France asserted that the smell of a dead
enemy was always sweet.If he had experienced the streets of Lucknow in
March, 1858, he might have had cause to modify his opinion."FOOTNOTES:

AN UNGRATEFUL DUTY--CAPTAIN BURROUGHS--THE DILKOOSHA AGAIN--GENERAL
WALPOLE AT ROOYAH--THE RAMGUNGA.After the Mutiny some meddling philanthropists in England tried to get
up an agitation about such stories as wounded sepoys being burnt alive;
but owing to the nature of the war it was morally impossible to have
prevented such accidents.As to cases of real wanton cruelty or outrage
committed by European soldiers, none came under my own notice, and I may
be permitted to relate here a story which goes far to disprove any
accusations of the sort.My company had been posted in a large building and garden near the Mint.Shortly after our arrival an order came for a non-commissioned officer
and a guard of selected men to take charge of a house with a harem, or
_zenana_, of about eighty women who had been rescued from different
harems about the Kaiserbagh,--begums of rank and of no rank, dancing
girls and household female slaves, some young and others of very
doubtful age.MacBean, our adjutant, selected me for the duty, first
because he said he knew I would not get drunk and thus overlook my
sense of responsibility; and, secondly, because by that time I had
picked up a considerable knowledge of colloquial Hindoostanee, and was
thus able to understand natives who could not speak English, and to make
myself understood by them.I got about a dozen old soldiers with me,
several of whom had been named for the duty by Sir Colin Campbell
himself, mostly married men of about twenty years' service.Owing to the
vicissitudes of my chequered life I have lost my pocket roll-book, and
do not now recollect the whole of the names of the men who formed this
guard.However, John Ellis, whose wife had acted as laundress for Sir
Colin in the Crimea, was one of them, and James Strachan, who was
nicknamed "the Bishop," was another; John M'Donald, the fourth of the
name in my company, was a third; I cannot now name more of them.If any
of that guard are alive now, they must be from threescore and ten to
fourscore years of age, because they were then all old men, tried and
true, and, as our adjutant said, Sir Colin had told him that no other
corps except the Ninety-Third could be trusted to supply a guard for
such a duty.MacBean, along with a staff or civil officer, accompanied
the guard to the house, and was very particular in impressing on my
attention the fact that the guard was on no pretence whatever to attempt
to hold any communication with the begums, except through a shrivelled,
parchment-faced, wicked-looking old woman (as I supposed), who, the
staff-officer told me, could speak English, and who had been directed
to report any shortcomings of the guard, should we not behave ourselves
circumspectly.But I must say I had little to fear on that head, for I
knew every one of my men could be trusted to be proof against the
temptation of begums, gold, or grog, and as for myself, I was then a
young non-commissioned officer with a very keen sense of my
responsibility.Shortly after we were installed in our position of trust, and the
officers had left us, we discovered several pairs of bright eyes peeping
out at us through the partly shattered venetians forming the doors and
windows of the house; and the person whom I had taken for a shrivelled
old woman came out and entered into conversation with me, at first in
Hindoostanee, but afterwards in very good and grammatical English.I
then discovered that what I had mistaken for a crack-voiced old woman, a
second edition of "the mother of the maids," was no other than a
confidential eunuch of the palace, who told me he had been over thirty
years about the court of Lucknow, employed as a sort of private
secretary under successive kings, as he was able to read and write
English, and could translate the English newspapers, etc., and could
also, judging from his villainous appearance, be trusted to strangle a
refractory begum or cut the throat of any one prying too closely into
court secrets.He was almost European in complexion, and appeared to me
to be more than seventy years of age, but he may have been much younger.He also told me that most of his early life had been spent at the court
of Constantinople, and that he had there learned English, and had found
this of great use to him at the court of Lucknow, where he had not only
kept up the knowledge, but had improved it by reading.By this time one of the younger begums, or nautch girls (I don't know
which), came out to see the guard, and did not appear by any means too
bashful.She evidently wished for a closer acquaintance, and I asked my
friend to request her to go back to her companions; but this she
declined to do, and wanted particularly to know why we were dressed in
petticoats, and if we were not part of the Queen of England's regiment
of eunuchs, and chaffed me a good deal about my fair hair and youthful
appearance.I was twenty-four hours on that guard before the begums were
removed by Major Bruce to a house somewhere near the Martiniere, and
during that twenty-four hours I learned more, through the assistance of
the English-speaking eunuch, about the virtues of polygamy and the
domestic slavery, intrigues, and crimes of the harem than I have learned
in all my other thirty-five years in India.If I dared, I could write a
few pages that would give the Government of India and the public of
England ten times more light on those cherished institutions than they
now possess.The authorities professed to take charge of those caged
begums for their own safety, but I don't think many of them were
over-thankful for the protection.Major Bruce, with an escort, removed
the ladies the next day, and I took leave of my communicative friend and
the begums without reluctance, and rejoined my company, glad to be rid
of such a dangerous charge.Except the company which stormed the Doorgah, the rest of the
Ninety-Third were employed more as guards on our return to the city; but
about the 23rd of the month Captain Burroughs and his company were
detailed, with some of Brazier's Sikhs, to drive a lot of rebels from
some mosques and large buildings which were the last positions held by
the enemy.If I remember rightly, Burroughs was then fourth on the list
of captains, and he got command of the regiment five years after,
through deaths by cholera, in Peshawar in 1862.The Ninety-Third had
three commanding officers in one day!Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonald and
Major Middleton both died within a few hours of each other, and
Burroughs at once became senior major and succeeded to the command, the
senior colonel, Sir H. Stisted, being in command of a brigade in Bengal.Burroughs was born in India and was sent to France early for his
education, at least for the military part of it, and was a cadet of the
_Ecole Polytechnique_ of Paris.This accounted for his excellent
swordsmanship, his thorough knowledge of French, and his foreign accent.Burroughs was an accomplished _maitre d'armes_.When he joined the
Ninety-Third as an ensign in 1850 he was known as "Wee Frenchie."I
don't exactly remember his height, I think it was under five feet; but
what he wanted in size he made up in pluck and endurance.He served
throughout the Crimean war, and was never a day absent.It was he who
volunteered to lead the forlorn hope when it was thought the Highland
Brigade were to storm the Redan, before it was known that the Russians
had evacuated the position.At the relief of Lucknow he was not the
first man through the hole in the Secundrabagh; that was Lance-Corporal
Dunley of Burroughs' company; Sergeant-Major Murray was the second, and
was killed inside; the third was a Sikh _sirdar_, Gokul Sing, of the
Fourth Punjab Infantry, and Burroughs was either the fourth or fifth.He
was certainly the first _officer_ of the regiment inside, and was
immediately attacked by an Oude Irregular _sowar_ armed with _tulwar_
and shield, who nearly slashed Burroughs' right ear off before he got
properly on his feet.It was the wire frame of his feather bonnet that
saved him; the _sowar_ got a straight cut at his head, but the sword
glanced off the feather bonnet and nearly cut off his right ear.However, Burroughs soon gathered himself together (there was so little
of him!)and showed his tall opponent that he had for once met his match
in the art of fencing; before many seconds Burroughs' sword had passed
through his opponent's throat and out at the back of his neck.Notwithstanding his severe wound, Burroughs fought throughout the
capture of the Secundrabagh, with his right ear nearly severed from his
head, and the blood running down over his shoulder to his gaiters; nor
did he go to have his wound dressed till after he had mustered his
company, and reported to the colonel how many of No.Although his men disliked many of his ways, they were proud of
their little captain for his pluck and good heart.I will relate two
instances of this:--When promoted, Captain Burroughs had the misfortune
to succeed the most popular officer in the regiment in the command of
his company, namely, Captain Ewart (now Lieutenant-General Sir John
Alexander Ewart, K.C.B., etc.), and, among other innovations, Burroughs
tried to introduce certain _Polytechnique_ ideas new to the
Ninety-Third.At the first morning parade after assuming command of the
company, he wished to satisfy himself that the ears of the men were
clean inside, but being so short, he could not, even on tiptoe, raise
himself high enough to see; he therefore made them come to the kneeling
position, and went along the front rank from left to right, minutely
inspecting the inside of every man's ears!The Ninety-Third were all
tall men in those days, none being under five feet six inches even in
the centre of the rear rank of the battalion companies; and the right
hand man of Burroughs' company was a stalwart Highlander named Donald
MacLean, who could scarcely speak English and stood about six feet three
inches.When Burroughs examined Donald's ears he considered them dirty,
and told the colour-sergeant to put Donald down for three days' extra
drill.Donald, hearing this, at once sprang to his feet from the
kneeling position and, looking down on the little captain with a look of
withering scorn, deliberately said, "She will take three days' drill
from a man, but not from a monkey!"Of course Donald was at once marched
to the rear-guard a prisoner, and a charge lodged against him for
"insubordination and insolence to Captain Burroughs at the time of
inspection on morning parade."When the prisoner was brought before the
colonel he read over the charge, and, turning to Captain Burroughs,
said: "This is a most serious charge, Captain Burroughs, and against an
old soldier like Donald MacLean who has never been brought up for
punishment before.Burroughs was ashamed to state
the exact words, but beat about the bush, saying that he had ordered
MacLean three days' drill, and that he refused to submit to the
sentence, making use of most insolent and insubordinate language; but
the colonel could not get him to state the exact words used, and the
colour-sergeant was called as second witness.The colour-sergeant gave a
plain, straightforward account of the ear-inspection; and when he stated
how MacLean had sprung to his feet on hearing the sentence of three
days' drill, and had told the captain, "She will take three days' drill
from a man, but not from a monkey," the whole of the officers present
burst into fits of laughter, and even the colonel had to hold his hand
to his mouth.As soon as he could speak he turned on MacLean, and told
him that he deserved to be tried by a court-martial and so forth, but
ended by sentencing him to "three days' grog stopped."The orderly-room
hut was then cleared of all except the colonel, Captain Burroughs, and
the adjutant, and no one ever knew exactly what passed; but there was no
repetition of the kneeling position for ear-inspection on morning
parade.I have already said that Burroughs had a most kindly heart, and
for the next three days after this incident, when the grog bugle
sounded, Donald MacLean was as regularly called to the captain's tent,
and always returned smacking his lips, and emphatically stating that
"The captain was a Highland gentleman after all, and not a French
monkey."From that day forward, the little captain and the tall
grenadier became the best of friends, and years after, on the evening of
the 11th of March, 1858, when the killed and wounded were collected
after the capture of the Begum's Kothee in Lucknow, I saw Captain
Burroughs crying like a tender-hearted woman by the side of a _dooly_ in
which was stretched the dead body of Donald MacLean, who, it was said,
received his death-wound defending his captain.I have the authority of
the late colour-sergeant of No.6 company for the statement that from
the date of the death of MacLean, Captain Burroughs regularly remitted
thirty shillings a month, through the minister of her parish, to
Donald's widowed mother, till the day of her death seven years after.When an action of this kind became generally known in the regiment, it
caused many to look with kindly feelings on most of the peculiarities of
Burroughs.The other anecdote goes back to Camp Kamara and the spring of 1856, when
the Highland Brigade were lying there half-way between Balaclava and
Sebastopol.As before noticed, Burroughs was more like a Frenchman than
a Highlander; there were many of his old _Polytechnique_ chums in the
French army in the Crimea, and almost every day he had some visitors
from the French camp, especially after the armistice was proclaimed.Some time in the spring of 1856 Burroughs had picked up a Tartar pony
and had got a saddle, etc., for it, but he could get no regular groom.Not being a field-officer he was not entitled to a regulation groom, and
not being well liked, none of his company would volunteer for the
billet, especially as it formed no excuse for getting off other duties.One of the company had accordingly to be detailed on fatigue duty every
day to groom the captain's pony.On a particular day this duty had
fallen to a young recruit who had lately joined by draft, a man named
Patrick Doolan, a real Paddy of the true Handy Andy type, who had made
his way somehow to Glasgow and had there enlisted into the Ninety-Third.This day, as usual, Burroughs had visitors from the French camp, and it
was proposed that all should go for a ride, so Patrick Doolan was called
to saddle the captain's pony.Doolan had never saddled a pony in his
life before, and he put the saddle on with the pommel to the tail and
the crupper to the front, and brought the pony thus accoutred to the
captain's hut.Every one commenced to laugh, and Burroughs, getting into
a white heat, turned on Patrick, saying, "You fool, you have put the
saddle on with the back to the front!"Patrick at once saluted, and,
without the least hesitation, replied, "Shure, sir, you never told me
whether you were to ride to Balaclava or the front."Burroughs was so
tickled with the ready wit of the reply that from that day he took
Doolan into his service as soldier-servant, taught him his work, and
retained him till March, 1858, when Burroughs had to go on sick leave
on account of wounds.Burroughs was one of the last men wounded in the
taking of Lucknow.Some days after the Begum's Kothee was stormed, he
and his company were sent to drive a lot of rebels out of a house near
the Kaiserbagh, and, as usual, Burroughs was well in advance of his men.Just as they were entering the place the enemy fired a mine, and the
captain was sent about a hundred feet in the air; but being like a cat
(in the matter of being difficult to kill, I mean), he fell on his feet
on the roof of a thatched hut, and escaped, with his life indeed, but
with one of his legs broken in two places below the knee.It was only
the skill of our good doctor Munro that saved his leg; but he was sent
to England on sick leave, and before he returned I had left the regiment
and joined the Commissariat Department.This ends my reminiscences of
Captain Burroughs.May he long enjoy the rank he has attained in the
peace of his island home in Orkney!Notwithstanding his peculiarities,
he was a brave and plucky soldier and a most kind-hearted gentleman.By the end of March the Ninety-Third returned to camp at the Dilkoosha,
glad to get out of the city, where we were suffocated by the stench of
rotting corpses, and almost devoured with flies by day and mosquitoes by
night.The weather was now very hot and altogether uncomfortable, more
especially since we were without any means of bathing and could obtain
no regular changes of clothing.By this time numbers of the townspeople had returned to the city and
were putting their houses in order, while thousands of _coolies_ and
low-caste natives were employed clearing dead bodies out of houses and
hidden corners, and generally cleaning up the city.When we repassed the scene of our hard-contested struggle, the Begum's
palace,--which, I may here remark, was actually a much stronger position
than the famous Redan at Sebastopol,--we found the inner ditch, that had
given us so much trouble to get across, converted into a vast grave, in
which the dead had been collected in thousands and then covered by the
earth which the enemy had piled up as ramparts.All round Lucknow for
miles the country was covered with dead carcases of every kind,--human
beings, horses, camels, bullocks, and donkeys,--and for miles the
atmosphere was tainted and the swarms of flies were horrible, a positive
torment and a nuisance.The only comfort was that they roosted at night;
but at meal-times they were indescribable, and it was impossible to keep
them out of our food; our plates of rice would be perfectly black with
flies, and it was surprising how we kept such good health, for we had
little or no sickness during the siege of Lucknow.During the few days we remained in camp at the Dilkoosha the army was
broken up into movable columns, to take the field after the different
parties of rebels and to restore order throughout Oude; for although
Lucknow had fallen, the rebellion was not by any means over; the whole
of Oude was still against us, and had to be reconquered.The
Forty-Second, Seventy-Ninth, and Ninety-Third (the regiments which
composed the famous old Highland Brigade of the Crimea) were once more
formed into one brigade, and with a regiment of Punjab Infantry and a
strong force of engineers, the Ninth Lancers, a regiment of native
cavalry, a strong force of artillery, both light and heavy,--in brief,
as fine a little army as ever took the field, under the command of
General Walpole, with Adrian Hope as brigadier,--was detailed for the
advance into Rohilcund for the recapture of Bareilly, where a large army
still held together under Khan Bahadoor Khan.Every one in the camp
expressed surprise that Sir Colin should entrust his favourite
Highlanders to Walpole.On the morning of the 7th of April, 1858, the time had at last arrived
when we were to leave Lucknow, and the change was hailed by us with
delight.We were glad to get away from the captured city, with its
horrible smells and still more horrible sights, and looked forward with
positive pleasure to a hot-weather campaign in Rohilcund.We were to
advance on Bareilly by a route parallel with the course of the Ganges,
so striking our tents at 2 A.M.we marched through the city
along the right bank of the Goomtee, past the Moosabagh, where our first
halt was made, about five miles out of Lucknow, in the midst of fresh
fields, away from all the offensive odours and the myriads of flies.One
instance will suffice to give my readers some idea of the torment we
suffered from these pests.When we struck tents all the flies were
roosting in the roofs; when the tents were rolled up the flies got
crushed and killed by bushels, and no one who has not seen such a sight
would credit the state of the inside of our tents when opened out to be
repitched on the new ground.After the tents were pitched and the roofs
swept down, the sweepers of each company were called to collect the dead
flies and carry them out of the camp.I noted down the quantity of flies
carried out of my own tent.The ordinary kitchen-baskets served out to
the regimental cooks by the commissariat for carrying bread, rice, etc.,
will hold about an imperial bushel, and from one tent there were carried
out five basketfuls of dead flies.The sight gave one a practical idea
of one of the ten plagues of Egypt!Being now rid of the flies we could
lie down during the heat of the day, and have a sleep without being
tormented.The defeated army of Lucknow had flocked into Rohilcund, and a large
force was reported to be collected in Bareilly under Khan Bahadoor Khan
and Prince Feroze Shah.The following is a copy of one of Khan Bahadoor
Khan's proclamations for the harassment of our advance: "Do not attempt
to meet the regular columns of the infidels, because they are superior
to you in discipline and have more guns; but watch their movements;
guard all the _ghats_ on the rivers, intercept their communications;
stop their supplies; cut up their piquets and _daks_; keep constantly
hanging about their camps; give them no rest!"These were, no doubt,
the correct tactics; it was the old Mahratta policy revived.However,
nothing came of it, and our advance was unopposed till we reached the
jungle fort of Nirput Singh, the Rajpoot chief of Rooyah, near the
village of Rhodamow.I was in the
advance-guard under command of a young officer who had just come out
from home as a cadet in the H.E.I.Company's service, and there being no
Company's regiments for him, he was attached to the Ninety-Third before
we left Lucknow.His name was Wace, a tall young lad of, I suppose,
sixteen or seventeen years of age.I don't remember him before that
morning, but he was most anxious for a fight, and I recollect that
before we marched off our camping-ground, Brigadier Hope called up young
Mr.Wace, and gave him instructions about moving along with great
caution with about a dozen picked men for the leading section of the
advance-guard.We advanced without opposition till sunrise, and then we came in sight
of an outpost of the enemy about three miles from the fort; but as soon
as they saw us they retired, and word was passed back to the column.Shortly afterwards instructions came for the advance-guard to wait for
the main column, and I remember young Mr.Wace going up to the
brigadier, and asking to be permitted to lead the assault on the fort,
should it come to a fight.At this time a summons to surrender had been
sent to the Raja, but he vouchsafed no reply, and, as we advanced, a
9-pounder shot was fired at the head of the column, killing a drummer
of the Forty-Second.The attack on the fort then commenced, without any
attempt being made to reconnoitre the position, and ended in a most
severe loss, Brigadier Hope being among the killed.Lieutenant
Willoughby, who commanded the Sikhs,--a brother of the officer who blew
up the powder-magazine at Delhi, rather than let it fall into the hands
of the enemy,--was also killed; as were Lieutenants Douglas and Bramley
of the Forty-Second, with nearly one hundred men, Highlanders and Sikhs.Hope was shot from a high tree inside the fort, and, at the time, it was
believed that the man who shot him was a European.[43] After we retired
from the fort the excitement was so great among the men of the
Forty-Second and Ninety-Third, owing to the sacrifice of so many
officers and men through sheer mismanagement, that if the officers had
given the men the least encouragement, I am convinced they would have
turned out in a body and hanged General Walpole.The officers who were
killed were all most popular men; but the great loss sustained by the
death of Adrian Hope positively excited the men to fury.So heated was
the feeling on the night the dead were buried, that if any
non-commissioned officer had dared to take the lead, the life of General
Walpole would not have been worth half an hour's purchase.After the force retired,--for we actually retired!--from Rooyah on the
evening of the 15th of April, we encamped about two miles from the
place, and a number of our dead were left in the ditch, mostly
Forty-Second and Sikhs; and, so far as I am aware, no attempt was made
to invest the fort or to keep the enemy in.They took advantage of this
to retreat during the night; but this they did leisurely, burning their
own dead, and stripping and mutilating those of our force that were
abandoned in the ditch.It was reported in the camp that Colonel Haggard
of the Ninth Lancers, commanding the cavalry brigade, had proposed to
invest the place, but was not allowed to do so by General Walpole, who
was said to have acted in such a pig-headed manner that the officers
considered him insane.Rumour added that when Colonel Haggard and a
squadron of the Lancers went to reconnoitre the place on the morning of
the 16th, it was found empty; and that when Colonel Haggard sent an
aide-de-camp to report this fact to the general, he had replied, "Thank
God!"appearing glad that Raja Nirput Singh and his force had slipped
through his fingers after beating back the best-equipped movable column
in India.These reports gaining currency in the camp made the general
still more unpopular, because, in addition to his incapability as an
officer, the men put him down as a coward.During the day the mutilated bodies of our men were recovered from the
ditch.The Sikhs burnt theirs, while a large fatigue party of the
Forty-Second and Ninety-Third was employed digging one long grave in a
_tope_ of trees not far from the camp.About four o'clock in the
afternoon the funeral took place, Brigadier Hope and the officers on
the right, wrapped in their tartan plaids, the non-commissioned officers
and the privates on their left, each sewn up in a blanket.Cowie, whom we of the Ninety-Third had nicknamed "the Fighting Padre,"
afterwards Bishop of Auckland, New Zealand, and the Rev.Ross,
chaplain of the Forty-Second, conducted the service, Mr.Ross reading
the ninetieth Psalm and Mr.The pipers of
the Forty-Second and Ninety-Third, with muffled drums, played _The
Flowers of the Forest_ as a dead march.In all my experience in the army
or out of it I never witnessed such intense grief, both among officers
and men, as was expressed at this funeral.Many of all ranks sobbed like
tender-hearted women.I especially remember our surgeon, "kind-hearted
Billy Munro" as the men called him; also Lieutenants Archie Butter and
Dick Cunningham, who were aides-de-camp to Adrian Hope.Cunningham had
rejoined the regiment after recovery from his wounds at Kudjwa in
October, 1857, but they had left him too lame to march, and he was a
supernumerary aide-de-camp to Brigadier Hope; he and Butter were both
alongside the brigadier, I believe, when he was struck down by the
renegade ruffian.We halted during the 17th, and strong fatigue-parties were employed with
the engineers destroying the fort by blowing up the gateways.The place
was ever after known in the Ninety-Third as "Walpole's Castle."On the
18th we marched, and on the 22nd we came upon the retreating rebels at
a place called Sirsa, on the Ramgunga.The Ninth Lancers and
Horse-Artillery and two companies of the Ninety-Third (I forget their
numbers) crossed the Ramgunga by a ford and intercepted the retreat of a
large number of the enemy, who were escaping by a bridge of boats, the
material for which the country people had collected for them.But their
retreat was now completely cut off, and about three hundred of them were
reported either killed or drowned in the Ramgunga.a tremendous sandstorm, with thunder, and rain in
torrents, came on.The Ramgunga became so swollen that it was impossible
for the detachment of the Ninety-Third to recross, and they bivouacked
in a deserted village on the opposite side, without tents, the officers
hailing across that they could make themselves very comfortable for the
night if they could only get some tea and sugar, as the men had
biscuits, and they had secured a quantity of flour and some goats in the
village.But the boats which the enemy had collected had all broken
adrift, and there was apparently no possibility of sending anything
across to our comrades.This dilemma evoked an act of real cool pluck on
the part of our commissariat _gomashta_,[44] _baboo_ Hera Lall
Chatterjee, whom I have before mentioned in my seventh chapter in
reference to the plunder of a cartload of biscuits at Bunnee bridge on
the retreat from Lucknow.By this time Hera Lall had become better
acquainted with the "wild Highlanders," and was even ready to risk his
life to carry a ration of tea and sugar to them.This he made into a
bundle, which he tied on the crown of his head, and although several of
the officers tried to dissuade him from the attempt, he tightened his
_chudder_[45] round his waist, and declaring that he had often swum the
Hooghly, and that the Ramgunga should not deprive the officers and men
of a detachment of his regiment of their tea, he plunged into the river,
and safely reached the other side with his precious freight on his head!This little incident was never forgotten in the regiment so long as Hera
Lall remained the commissariat _gomashta_ of the Ninety-Third.He was
then a young man, certainly not more than twenty.Although thirty-five
more years of rough-and-tumble life have now considerably grizzled his
appearance, he must often look back with pride to that stormy April
evening in 1858, when he risked his life in the Ramgunga to carry a
tin-pot of tea to the British soldiers.Among the enemy killed that day were several wearing the uniforms
stripped from the dead of the Forty-Second in the ditch of Rooyah; so,
of course, we concluded that this was Nirput Singh's force, and the
defeat and capture of its guns in some measure, I have no doubt,
re-established General Walpole in the good opinion of the authorities,
but not much in that of the force under his command.Nothing else of consequence occurred till about the 27th of April, when
our force rejoined the Commander-in-Chief's column, which had advanced
_via_ Futtehghur, and we heard that Sir William Peel had died of
smallpox at Cawnpore on his way to Calcutta.The news went through the
camp from regiment to regiment, and caused almost as much sorrow in the
Ninety-Third as the death of poor Adrian Hope.FOOTNOTES:

BATTLE OF BAREILLY--GHAZIS--A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT--HALT AT BAREILLY
--ACTIONS OF POSGAON, RUSSOOLPORE, AND NOWRUNGABAD--REST AT LAST!The heat was now very oppressive, and we had many men struck down by the
sun every day.We reached Shahjehanpore on the 30th of April, and found
that every building in the cantonments fit for sheltering European
troops had been destroyed by order of the Nana Sahib, who, however, did
not himself wait for our arrival.Strange to say, the bridge of boats
across the Ramgunga was not destroyed, and some of the buildings in the
jail, and the wall round it, were still standing.Colonel Hale and a
wing of the Eighty-Second were left here with some guns, to make the
best of their position in the jail, which partly dominated the city.The
Shahjehanpore distillery was mostly destroyed, but the native distillers
had been working it, and there was a large quantity of rum still in the
vats, which was found to be good and was consequently annexed by the
commissariat.On the 2nd of May we left Shahjehanpore _en route_ for Bareilly, and on
the next day reached Futtehgunge Every village was totally deserted,
but no plundering was allowed, and any camp-followers found marauding
were soon tied up by the provost-marshal's staff.Proclamations were
sent everywhere for the people to remain in their villages, but without
any effect.Two days later we reached Furreedpore, which we also found
deserted, but with evident signs that the enemy were near; and our
bazaars were full of reports of the great strength of the army of Khan
Bahadoor Khan and Feroze Shah.The usual estimate was thirty thousand
infantry, twenty-five thousand cavalry, and about three hundred guns,
among which was said to be a famous black battery that had beaten the
European artillery at ball-practice a few months before they mutinied at
Meerut.The left wing of the Ninety-Third was thrown out, with a
squadron of the Lancers and Tombs' battery, as the advance piquet.As
darkness set in we could see the fires of the enemy's outposts, their
patrol advancing quite close to our sentries during the night, but
making no attack.on the 5th of May, according to Sir Colin's usual
plan, three days' rations were served out, and the whole force was under
arms and slowly advancing before daylight.By sunrise we could see the
enemy drawn up on the plain some five miles from Bareilly, in front of
what had been the native lines; but as we advanced, they retired.By
noon we had crossed the nullah in front of the old cantonments, and,
except by sending round-shot among us at long distances, which did not
do much harm, the enemy did not dispute our advance.We were halted in
the middle of a bare, sandy plain, and we of the rank and file then got
to understand why the enemy were apparently in some confusion; we could
hear the guns of Brigadier Jones ("Jones the Avenger" as he was called)
hammering at them on the other side.The Ninety-Third formed the extreme
right of the front line of infantry with a squadron of the Lancers and
Tombs' battery of horse-artillery.The heat was intense, and when about
two o'clock a movement in the mango _topes_ in our front caused the
order to stand to our arms, it attained such a pitch that the barrels of
our rifles could not be touched by our bare hands!The Sikhs and our light company advanced in skirmishing order, when some
seven to eight hundred matchlock-men opened fire on them, and all at
once a most furious charge was made by a body of about three hundred and
sixty Rohilla Ghazis, who rushed out, shouting "_Bismillah!Deen!_" Sir Colin was close by, and called out, "Ghazis,
Ghazis!However, they
inclined to our left, and only a few came on to the Ninety-Third, and
these were mostly bayoneted by the light company which was extended in
front of the line.The main body rushed on the centre of the
Forty-Second; but as soon as he saw them change their direction Sir
Colin galloped on, shouting out, "Close up, Forty-Second!But that was not so easily done; the Ghazis charged in
blind fury, with their round shields on their left arms, their bodies
bent low, waving their _tulwars_ over their heads, throwing themselves
under the bayonets, and cutting at the men's legs.Colonel Cameron, of
the Forty-Second, was pulled from his horse by a Ghazi, who leaped up
and seized him by the collar while he was engaged with another on the
opposite side; but his life was saved by Colour-Sergeant Gardener, who
seized one of the enemy's _tulwars_, and rushing to the colonel's
assistance cut off the Ghazi's head.General Walpole was also pulled off
his horse and received two sword-cuts, but was rescued by the bayonets
of the Forty-Second.The struggle was short, but every one of the Ghazis
was killed.None attempted to escape; they had evidently come on to kill
or be killed, and a hundred and thirty-three lay in one circle right in
front of the colours of the Forty-Second.The Commander-in-Chief himself saw one of the Ghazis, who had broken
through the line, lying down, shamming dead.Sir Colin caught the glance
of his eye, saw through the ruse, and called to one of the Forty-Second,
"Bayonet that man!"But the Ghazi was enveloped in a thick quilted tunic
of green silk, through which the blunt Enfield bayonet would not pass,
and the Highlander was in danger of being cut down, when a Sikh
_sirdar_[46] of the Fourth Punjabis rushed to his assistance, and took
the Ghazi's head clean off with one sweep of his keen _tulwar_.These
Ghazis, with a very few exceptions, were gray-bearded men of the Rohilla
race, clad in green, with green turbans and _kummerbunds_,[47] round
shields on the left arm, and curved _tulwars_ that would split a hair.They only succeeded in wounding about twenty men--they threw themselves
so wildly on the bayonets of the Forty-Second!One of them, an exception
to the majority, was quite a youth, and having got separated from the
rest challenged the whole of the line to come out and fight him.Joiner, the quartermaster of the Ninety-Third, firing his
carbine, but missing.Joiner returned the fire with his revolver,
and the Ghazi then threw away his carbine and rushed at Joiner with his
_tulwar_.Some of the light company tried to take the youngster
prisoner, but it was no use; he cut at every one so madly, that they had
to bayonet him.The commotion caused by this attack was barely over, when word was
passed that the enemy were concentrating in front for another rush, and
the order was given for the spare ammunition to be brought to the front.I was detached with about a dozen men of No.7 company to find the
ammunition-guard, and bring our ammunition in rear of the line.Just as
I reached the ammunition-camels, a large force of the rebel cavalry, led
by Feroze Shah in person, swept round the flank and among the baggage,
cutting down camels, camel-drivers, and camp-followers in all
directions.My detachment united with the ammunition-guard and defended
ourselves, shooting down a number of the enemy's _sowars_.Ross, chaplain of the Forty-Second, running for his life,
dodging round camels and bullocks with a rebel _sowar_ after him, till,
seeing our detachment, he rushed to us for protection, calling out,
"Ninety-Third, shoot that impertinent fellow!"Bob Johnston, of my
company, shot the _sowar_ down.Ross had no sword nor revolver, and
not even a stick with which to defend himself.Moral--When in the field,
_padres_, carry a good revolver!Ross gained
our protection, we saw Mr.Russell, of _The Times_, who was ill and
unable to walk from the kick of a horse, trying to escape on horseback.He had got out of his _dooly_, undressed and bareheaded as he was, and
leaped into the saddle, as the _syce_ had been leading his horse near
him.Several of the enemy's _sowars_ were dodging through the camels to
get at him.We turned our rifles on them, and I shot down the one
nearest to Mr.Russell, just as he had cut down an intervening
camel-driver and was making for "Our Special"; in fact, his _tulwar_ was
actually lifted to swoop down on Mr.Russell's bare head when my bullet
put a stop to his proceedings.Russell tumble from his saddle
at the same instant as the _sowar_ fell, and I got a rare fright, for I
thought my bullet must have struck both.Russell had fallen, and I then saw from the position of the slain
_sowar_ that my bullet had found its proper billet, and that Mr.Russell
was down with sunstroke, the blood flowing freely from his nose.Our Mooltanee Irregulars were after the enemy, and
I had to hasten to the line with the spare ammunition; but before I left
Mr.Russell to his fate, I called some of the Forty-Second
baggage-guards to put him into his _dooly_ and take him to their doctor,
while I hastened back to the line and reported the occurrence to Captain
Dawson.Next morning I was glad to hear that Mr.Russell was still
alive, and likely to get over his stroke.After this charge of the rebel cavalry we were advanced; but the thunder
of Jones' attack on the other side of the city evidently disconcerted
the enemy, and they made off to the right of our line, while large
numbers of Ghazis concentrated themselves in the main buildings of the
city.We suffered more from the sun than from the enemy; and after we
advanced into the shelter of a large mango _tope_ we were nearly eaten
alive by swarms of small green insects, which invaded our bare legs in
thousands, till we were glad to leave the shelter of the mango trees and
take to the open plain again.As night drew on the cantonments were
secured, the baggage was collected, and we bivouacked on the plain,
strong piquets being thrown out.My company was posted in a small field
of onions near a _pucca_[48] well with a Persian wheel for lifting the
water.We supped off the biscuits in our haversacks, raw onions, and the
cool water drawn from well, and then went off to sleep.I wish I might
always sleep as soundly as I did that night after my supper of raw
onions and dry biscuits!On the 6th of May the troops were under arms, and advanced on the city
of Bareilly.But little opposition was offered, except from one large
house on the outskirts of the town, in which a body of about fifty
Rohilla Ghazis had barricaded themselves, and a company (I think it was
No.6 of the Ninety-Third) was sent to storm the house, after several
shells had been pitched into it.This was done without much loss, except
that of one man; I now forget his name, but think it was William
MacDonald.He rushed into a room full of Ghazis, who, before his
comrades could get to his assistance, had cut him into sixteen pieces
with their sharp _tulwars_!As the natives said, he was cut into
annas.[49] But the house was taken, and the whole of the Ghazis slain,
with only the loss of this one man killed and about half a dozen
wounded.While this house was being stormed the townspeople sent a deputation of
submission to the Commander-in-Chief, and by ten o'clock we had pitched
our camp near the ruins of the church which had been destroyed twelve
months before.Khan Bahadoor Khan and the Nana Sahib were reported to
have fled in the direction of the Nepal Terai, while Feroze Shah, with a
force of cavalry and guns, had gone back to attack Shahjehanpore.About mid-day on the 6th a frightful accident happened, by which a large
number of camp-followers and cattle belonging to the ordnance-park were
killed.Whether for concealment or by design (it was never known which)
the enemy had left a very large quantity of gunpowder and loaded shells
in a dry well under a huge tree in the centre of the old cantonment.The
well had been filled to the very mouth with powder and shells, and then
covered with a thin layer of dry sand.A large number of ordnance
_khalasies_,[50] bullock-drivers, and _dooly_-bearers had congregated
under the tree to cook their mid-day meal, lighting their fires right on
the top of this powder-magazine, when it suddenly exploded with a most
terrific report, shaking the ground for miles, making the tent-pegs fly
out of the hard earth, and throwing down tents more than a mile from the
spot.I was lying down in a tent at the time, and the concussion was so
great that I felt as if lifted clear off the ground.The tent-pegs flew
out all round, and down came the tents, before the men, many of whom
were asleep, had time to get clear of the canvas.By the time we got our
arms free of the tents, bugles were sounding the assembly in all
directions, and staff-officers galloping over the plain to ascertain
what had happened.The spot where the accident had occurred was easily
found.The powder having been in a deep well, it acted like a huge
mortar, fired perpendicularly; an immense cloud of black smoke was sent
up in a vertical column at least a thousand yards high, and thousands of
shells were bursting in it, the fragments flying all round in a circle
of several hundred yards.As the place was not far from the
ammunition-park, the first idea was that the enemy had succeeded in
blowing up the ammunition; but those who had ever witnessed a similar
accident could see that, whatever had happened, the concussion was too
great to be caused by only one or two waggon-loads of powder.From the
appearance of the column of smoke and the shells bursting in it, as if
shot out of a huge mortar, it was evident that the accident was confined
to one small spot, and the belief became general that the enemy had
exploded an enormous mine.But after some time the truth became known,
the troops were dispersed, and the tents repitched.This explosion was
followed in the afternoon by a most terrific thunderstorm and heavy
rain, which nearly washed away the camp.The storm came on as the
non-commissioned officers of the Ninety-Third and No.2 company were
falling in to bury Colour-Sergeant Mackie, who had been knocked down by
the sun the day before and had died that forenoon.Just when we were
lowering the body into the grave, there was a crash of thunder almost as
loud as the explosion of the powder-mine.The ground becoming soaked
with rain, the tent-pegs drew and many tents were again thrown down by
the force of the hurricane; and as everything we had became soaked, we
passed a most uncomfortable night.On the morning of the 7th of May we heard that Colonel Hale and the wing
of the Eighty-Second left in the jail at Shahjehanpore had been attacked
by Feroze Shah and the Nana Sahib, and were sore pushed to defend
themselves.A brigade, consisting of the Sixtieth Rifles, Seventy-Ninth
Highlanders, several native regiments, the Ninth Lancers, and some
batteries of artillery, under Brigadier John Jones ("the Avenger") was
at once started back for the relief of Shahjehanpore--rather a gloomy
outlook for the hot weather of 1858!While this brigade was starting,
the remainder of the force which was to hold Bareilly for the hot
season, consisting of the Forty-Second, Seventy-Eighth, and
Ninety-Third, shifted camp to the sandy plain near where Bareilly
railway station now stands, hard by the little fort in the centre of the
plain.There we remained in tents during the whole of May, large working
parties being formed every morning to assist the engineers to get what
shelter was possible ready for the hottest months.The district jail was
arranged as barracks for the Ninety-Third, and we moved into them on the
1st of June.The Forty-Second got the old _cutchery_[51] buildings with
a new thatch roof; and the Seventy-Eighth had the Bareilly College.I omitted to mention in its proper place that on the death of Adrian
Hope, Colonel A. S. Leith-Hay, of the Ninety-Third, succeeded to the
command of the brigade, and Major W. G. A. Middleton got command of the
regiment till we rejoined the Commander-in-Chief, when it was found that
Lieutenant-Colonel Ross, who had exchanged with Lieutenant-Colonel C.
Gordon, had arrived from England and taken command before we retook
Bareilly.We remained in Bareilly from May till October in comparative peace.We
had one or two false alarms, and a wing of the Forty-Second, with some
cavalry and artillery, went out about the beginning of June to disperse
a body of rebels who were threatening an attack on Moradabad.These reminiscences do not, as I have before remarked, profess to be a
history of the Mutiny except in so far as I saw it from the ranks of the
Ninety-Third.But I may correct historical mistakes when I find them,
and in vol.500, of _The Indian Empire_, by R. Montgomery
Martin, the following statement occurs: "Khan Bahadoor Khan, of
Bareilly, held out in the Terai until the close of 1859; and then,
hemmed in by the Goorkhas on one side and the British forces on the
other, was captured by Jung Bahadoor.The Khan is described as an old
man, with a long white beard, bent almost double with rheumatic fever.His life is considered forfeited by his alleged complicity in the
Bareilly murders, but his sentence is not yet pronounced."Khan Bahadoor Khan was captured by the Bareilly
police-levy early in July, 1858, and was hanged in my presence in front
of the _kotwalee_ in Bareilly a few days after his capture.He was an
old man with a long white beard, but not at all bent with age, and there
was certainly no want of proof of his complicity in the Bareilly
murders.Next to the Nana Sahib he was one of the most active
instigators of murder in the rebel ranks.He was a retired judge of the
Company's service, claiming descent from the ancient rulers of
Rohilcund, whom the English, in the time of Warren Hastings, had
assisted the Nawab of Lucknow to put down in the Rohilla war.His
capture was effected in the following manner:--Colonel W. C. M'Donald,
of the Ninety-Third, was on the staff in the Crimea, and he had in his
employ a man named Tahir Beg who was a sort of confidential interpreter.Whether this man was Turkish, Armenian, or Bulgarian I don't know, but
this much I do know; among Mahommedans Tahir Beg was a strict Mussulman,
among Bulgarians he was a Roman Catholic, and in the Ninety-Third he had
no objections to be a Presbyterian.He was a good linguist, speaking
English, French, and Turkish, as well as most of the vernaculars of Asia
Minor; and when the Crimean war was over, he accompanied Major M'Donald
to England in the capacity of an ordinary servant.In 1857, when the
expedition under Lord Elgin was being got ready for China, Colonel
M'Donald was appointed quarter-master-general, and started for Canton
taking Tahir Beg with him as a servant; but, the expedition to China
having been diverted for the suppression of the Mutiny, M'Donald
rejoined the regiment with Tahir Beg still with him in the same
capacity.From his knowledge of Turkish and Persian Tahir Beg soon made
himself master of Hindoostanee, and he lived in the regimental bazaar
with the Mahommedan shopkeepers, among whom he professed himself a
strict follower of the Prophet.After he became pretty well conversant
with the language, it was reported that he gained much valuable
information for the authorities.When Bareilly was recaptured
arrangements were made for the enlistment of a police-levy, and Tahir
Beg got the appointment of city _kotwal_[52] and did valuable service by
hunting out a great number of leading rebels.It was Tahir Beg who heard
that Khan Bahadoor Khan had returned to the vicinity of Bareilly with
only a small body of followers; and he arranged for his capture, and
brought him in a prisoner to the guard-room of the Ninety-Third.Khan
Bahadoor Khan was put through a brief form of trial by the civil power,
and was found guilty of rebellion and murder upon both native and
European evidence.By that time several Europeans who had managed to
escape to Naini Tal on the outbreak of the Mutiny through the favour of
the late Raja of Rampore, had returned; so there was no doubt of the
prisoner's guilt.I must mention another incident that happened in Bareilly.Among the
gentlemen who returned from Naini Tal, was one whose brother had been
shot by his bearer, his most trusted servant.This ruffian turned out to
be no other than the very man who had denounced Jamie Green as a spy.It
was either early in August or at the end of July that a strange European
gentleman, while passing through the regimental bazaar of the
Ninety-Third, noticed an officer's servant, who was a most devout
Christian, could speak English, and was a regular attendant at all
soldiers' evening services with the regimental chaplain.The gentleman
(I now forget his name) laid hold of our devout Christian brother in the
bazaar, and made him over to the nearest European guard, when he was
tried and found guilty of the murder of a whole family of
Europeans--husband, wife, and children--in May, 1857.There was no want
of evidence, both European and native, against him.Thus was the death
of the unfortunate Jamie Green avenged.I may add a rather amusing
incident about this man.His master evidently believed that this was a
case of mistaken identity, and went to see the brigadier, Colonel A. S.
Leith-Hay, on behalf of his servant.But it turned out that the man had
joined the British camp at Futtehghur in the preceding January, and
Colonel Leith-Hay was the first with whom he had taken service and
consequently knew the fellow.However, the brigadier listened to what
the accused's master had to urge until he mentioned that the man was a
most devout Christian, and read the Bible morning and evening.On this
Colonel Leith-Hay could listen to the argument no longer, but shouted
out:--"He a Christian!He's no more a
Christian than I am!He served me for one month, and robbed me of more
than ten times his pay.So he was made over to the
civil commissioner, tried, found guilty, and hanged.About the end of September the
weather was comparatively cool.Many people had returned from Naini Tal
to look after their wrecked property.General Colin Troup with the
Sixty-Sixth Regiment of Goorkhas had come down from Kumaon, and
soldiers' sports were got up for the amusement of the troops and
visitors.Among the latter was the loyal Raja of Rampore, who presented
a thousand rupees for prizes for the games and five thousand for a
dinner to all the troops in the garrison.At these games the
Ninety-Third carried off all the first prizes for putting the shot,
throwing the hammer, and tossing the caber.Our best athlete was a man
named George Bell, of the grenadier company, the most powerful man in
the British army.Before the regiment left England Bell had beaten all
comers at all the athletic games throughout Scotland.He stood about six
feet four inches, and was built in proportion, most remarkably active
for his size both in running and leaping, and also renowned for feats of
strength.There was a young lad of the band named Murdoch MacKay, the
smallest boy in the regiment, but a splendid dancer; and the two, "the
giant and the pigmy," as they were called, attended all the athletic
games throughout Scotland from Edinburgh to Inverness, always returning
covered with medals.I mention all this because the Bareilly sports
proved the last to poor George Bell.An enormous caber having been cut,
and all the leading men (among them some very powerful artillerymen) of
the brigade had tried to toss it and failed.The brigadier then ordered
three feet to be cut from it, expressing his opinion that there was not
a man in the British army who could toss it.On this George Bell stepped
into the arena, and said he would take a turn at it before it was cut;
he put the huge caber on his shoulders, balanced it, and tossed it clean
over.While the caber was being cut for the others, Bell ran in a
hundred yards' race, which he also won; but he came in with his mouth
full of blood.He had, through over-exertion, burst a blood-vessel in
his lungs.He slowly bled to death and died about a fortnight after we
left Bareilly, and lies buried under a large tree in the jungles of Oude
between Fort Mithowlie and the banks of the Gogra.Bell was considered
an ornament to, and the pride of, the regiment, and his death was
mourned by every officer and man in it, and by none more than by our
popular doctor, Billy Munro, who did everything that a physician could
do to try and stop the bleeding; but without success.We left Bareilly on the 10th of October, and marched to Shahjehanpore,
where we were joined by a battalion of the Sixtieth Rifles, the
Sixty-Sixth Goorkhas, some of the Sixth Carabineers, Tomb's troop of
horse-artillery, and a small train of heavy guns and mortars.On the
17th of October we had our first brush with the enemy at the village of
Posgaon, about twenty miles from Shahjehanpore.Here they were strong in
cavalry, and tried the Bareilly game of getting round the flanks and
cutting up our camp-followers.But a number of them got hemmed in
between the ammunition-guard and the main line, and Cureton's Mooltanee
cavalry, coming round on them from both flanks, cut down about fifty of
them, capturing their horses.In the midst of this scrimmage two of the
enemy, getting among the baggage-guard, were taken for two of our native
cavalry, till at length they separated from the main body and got
alongside of a man who was some distance away.One of them called to the
poor fellow to look in another direction, when the second one cut his
head clean off, leaped from his horse, and, lifting the head, sprang
into his saddle and was off like the wind!Many rifle-bullets were sent
after him, but he got clear away, carrying the head with him.The next encounter we had was at Russoolpore, and then at Nowrungabad,
where the Queen's proclamation, transferring the government from the
Company to the Crown, was read.After this all our tents were sent into
Mahomdee, and we took to the jungles without tents or baggage, merely a
greatcoat and a blanket; and thus we remained till after the taking of
Mithowlie.We then returned to Sitapore, where we got our tents again
the day before Christmas, 1858; and by the new year we were on the banks
of the Gogra, miles from any village.The river swarmed with alligators
of enormous size, and the jungles with wild pig and every variety of
game, and scarcely a day passed without our seeing tigers, wolves, and
hyaenas.We remained in those jungles
across the Gogra, in sight of the Nepaul hills, till about the end of
February, by which time thousands of the rebels had tendered their
submission and returned to their homes.The Ninety-Third then got the
route for Subathoo, in the Himalayas near Simla.Leaving the jungles of
Oude, we marched _via_ Shahjehanpore, Bareilly, Moradabad, and thence by
the foot of the hills till we came into civilised regions at
Saharunpore; thence to Umballa, reaching Subathoo about the middle of
April with our clothes completely in rags.We had received no new
clothing since we had arrived in India, and our kilts were torn into
ribbons.But the men were in splendid condition, and could have marched
thirty miles a day without feeling fatigued, if our baggage-animals
could have kept up with us.On our march out from Kalka, the
Commander-in-Chief passed us on his way to Simla.This ended the work of the old Ninety-Third Sutherland Highlanders in
the Mutiny, and here, for the present, I will end my reminiscences.FOOTNOTES:

THE HISTORY OF THE MURDER OF MAJOR NEILL AT AUGUR IN 1887


I will relate an incident of an unusual kind, told to me by a man whom I
met in Jhansi, which has reference to the executions ordered by General
Neill at Cawnpore in July and August, 1857.But before I do so I may
mention that in Cawnpore, Jhansi, and Lucknow I found the natives very
unwilling to enter into conversation or to give any information about
the events of that year.In this statement I don't include the natives
of the class who acted as guides, etc., or those who were in the service
of Government at the time._They_ were ready enough to talk; but as a
rule I knew as much myself as they could tell me.Those whom I found
suspicious of my motives and unwilling to talk, were men who must have
been on the side of the rebels against us.I looked out for such, and
met many who had evidently served as soldiers, and who admitted that
they had been in the army before 1857; but when I tried to get them to
speak about the Mutiny, as a rule they pretended to have been so young
that they had forgotten all about it,--generally a palpable falsehood,
judging from their personal appearance,--or they professed to have been
absent in their villages and to know nothing about the events happening
in the great centres of the rebellion.The impression left on my mind
was that they were either afraid or ashamed to talk about the Mutiny.In the second chapter of these reminiscences it may be remembered I
asked if any reader could let me know whether Major A. H. S. Neill,
commanding the Second Regiment Central India Horse, who was shot on
parade by Sowar Mazar Ali at Augur, Central India, on the 14th March,
1887, was a son of General Neill of Cawnpore fame.The information has
not been forthcoming[53]; and for want of it I cannot corroborate the
following statement in a very strange story.In 1892 I passed two days at Jhansi, having been obliged to wait because
the gentleman whom I had gone to see on business was absent from the
station; and I went all over the city to try and pick up information
regarding the Mutiny.I eventually came across a man who, by his
military salute, I could see had served in the army, and I entered into
conversation with him.At first he pretended that his connection with the army had merely been
that of an armourer-_mistree_[54] of several European regiments; and he
told me that he had served in the armourer's shop of the Ninety-Third
when they were in Jhansi twenty-four years ago, in 1868 and 1869.After
I had informed him that the Ninety-Third was my regiment, he appeared to
be less reticent; and at length he admitted that he had been an armourer
in the service of Scindia before the Mutiny, and that he was in Cawnpore
when the Mutiny broke out, and also when the city was retaken by
Generals Havelock and Neill.After a long conversation he appeared to be convinced that I had no evil
intentions, but was merely anxious to collect reliable evidence
regarding events which, even now, are but slightly known.Amongst other
matters he told me that the (late) Maharaja Scindia was not by any means
so loyal as the Government believed him to be; that he himself (my
informant) had formed one of a deputation that was sent to Cawnpore from
Gwalior to the Nana Sahib before the outbreak; and that although keeping
in the background, the Maharaja Scindia incited his army to rebellion
and to murder their officers, and himself fled as a pretended fugitive
to Agra to devise means to betray the fort of Agra, should the Gwalior
army, as he anticipated would be the case, prove victorious over the
British.He also told me that the farce played by Scindia about 1874,
viz.the giving up a spurious Nana Sahib, was a prearranged affair
between Scindia and the _fakeer_ who represented the Nana.But, as I
expressed my doubts about the truth of all this, my friend came down to
more recent times, and asked me if I remembered about the murder of
Major Neill at Augur in Central India in 1887, thirty years after the
Mutiny?I told him that I very well remembered reading of the case in
the newspapers of the time.He then asked me if I knew why Major Neill
was murdered?I replied that the published accounts of the murder and
trial were so brief that I had formed the conclusion that something was
concealed from the public, and that I myself was of opinion that a woman
must have been the cause of the murder,--that Major Neill possibly had
been found in some intrigue with one of Mazar Ali's womenkind.To which
he replied that I was quite wrong.He then told me that Major Neill was
a son of General Neill of Cawnpore fame, and that Sowar Mazar Ali, who
shot him, was a son of Suffur Ali, _duffadar_ of the Second Regiment
Light Cavalry, who was unjustly accused of having murdered Sir Hugh
Wheeler at the Suttee Chowrah _ghat_, and was hanged for the murder by
order of General Neill, after having been flogged by sweepers and made
to lick clean a portion of the blood-stained floor of the
slaughter-house.After the recapture of Cawnpore, Suffur Ali was arrested in the city,
and accused of having cut off General Wheeler's head as he alighted from
his palkee at the Suttee Chowrah _ghat_ on the 27th of June, 1857.This
he stoutly denied, pleading that he was a loyal servant of the Company
who had been compelled to join in the Mutiny against his will.General
Neill, however, would not believe him, so he was taken to the
slaughter-house and flogged by Major Bruce's sweeper-police till he
cleaned up his spot of blood from the floor of the house where the women
and children were murdered.When about to be hanged Suffur Ali adjured
every Mahommedan in the crowd to have a message sent to Rohtuck, to his
infant son, by name Mazar Ali, to inform him that his father had been
unjustly denied and flogged by sweepers by order of General Neill before
being hanged, and that his dying message to him was that he prayed God
and the Prophet to spare him and strengthen his arm to avenge the death
of his father on General Neill or any of his descendants.My informant went on to tell me that Mazar Ali had served under Major
Neill for years, and had been treated by him with special kindness
before he came to know that the Major was the son of the man who had
ordered his father's execution; that while he was lying ill in hospital
a _fakeer_ one day arrived in the station from some remote quarter of
India, and told him of his father's dying imprecation, and that Major
Neill being the son of General Neill, it was the decree of fate that
Mazar Ali should shoot Major Neill on parade the following day; which he
did, without any apparent motive whatever.I expressed my doubts about the truth of all this, when my informant
told me he could give me a copy of a circular, printed in Oordoo and
English, given to the descendants of Suffur Ali, directing them, as a
message from the other world, to avenge the death and defilement of
their father.The man eventually brought the leaflet to me in the _dak_
bungalow in Jhansi.The circular is in both Oordoo and English, and
printed in clean, clear type; but so far as I can read it, the English
translation, which is printed on the leaflet beneath the Oordoo, and a
copy of which I reproduce below, does not strike me as a literal
translation of the Oordoo.The latter seems to me to be couched in
language calculated to prove a much stronger incitement to murder than
the English version would imply.However, the following is the English
version _verbatim_, as it appears on the leaflet, word for word and
point for point, italics and all._The imprecation, vociferated by_ SUFFUR ALI,
      _Duffadar 2nd Regiment Light Cavalry, who was executed at
      the Slaughter-house, on the 25th July, 1857, for killing_
      SIR HUGH WHEELER, _at the Suttechoura Ghat_.be pleased to receive into Paradise the
      soul of your humble servant, whose body Major Bruce's Mehtur
      police are now defiling by lashes, forced to lick a space of
      the blood-stained floor of the Slaughter-house, and
      hereafter to be hanged, by the order of General Neill.And,
      oh Prophet!in due time inspire my infant son Mazar Ali of
      Rohtuck, that he may revenge this desecration on the General
      and his descendants._Take notice!_--Mazar Ali, Sowar, 2nd Regiment, Central
      India Horse, who under divine mission, shot Major A. H. S.
      Neill, Commanding the Corps, at Augur, Central India, on the
      14th March 1887, was sentenced to death by Sir Lepel
      Griffin, Governor-General's Agent.The Oordoo in the circular is printed in the Persian character without
the vowel-points, and as I have not read much Oordoo since I passed my
Hindoostanee examination thirty-three years ago, I have had some
difficulty in translating the leaflet, especially as it is without the
vowel-points.The man who gave it to me asked if I knew anything about
the family of General Neill, and I replied that I did not, which was the
truth.When I asked why he wanted to know, he said that if any more of
his sons were still in India, their lives would soon be taken by the
descendants of men who were defiled and hanged at Cawnpore under the
brigade-order of General Neill, dated Cawnpore, 25th of July, 1857.This
is the order to which I have alluded in the second chapter of my
reminiscences, and which remained in force till the arrival of Sir Colin
Campbell at Cawnpore in the following November.As I had never seen a
copy of it, having only heard of it, I asked my informant how he knew
about it.He told me that thousands of copies, in English, Oordoo, and
Hindee, were in circulation in the bazaars of Upper India.I told my
friend that I should very much like to see a copy, and he promised to
bring me one.Shortly after he left me in the _dak_ bungalow,
undertaking to return with a copy of the order, as also numerous
proclamations from the English Government, and the counter-proclamations
on the part of the leaders of the rebellion.I thought that here I had
struck a rich historical mine; but my friend did not turn up again!I
sat up waiting for him till long after midnight, and as he did not
return I went into the city again the following day to the place where I
had met him; but all the people around pretended to know nothing
whatever about the man, and I saw no more of him.However, I was glad to
have got the leaflet _re_ the assassination of Major Neill, because
several gentlemen have remarked, since I commenced my reminiscences,
that I mention so many incidents not generally known, that many are
inclined to believe that I am inventing history rather than relating
facts.But that is not so; and, besides what I have related, I could
give hundreds of most interesting incidents that are not generally known
nor ever will be known.[55]

Now, in my humble opinion, is the time that a history of the real facts
and causes of the Mutiny should be written, if a competent man could
devote the time to do so, and to visit the centres of the rebellion and
get those who took part in the great uprising against the rule of the
Feringhee to come forward, with full confidence of safety, and relate
all they know about the affair.Thousands of facts would come to light
which would be of immense historical importance, as also of great
political value to Government, facts that in a few years will become
lost to the world, or be remembered only as traditions of 1857.But the
man who is to undertake the work must be one with a thorough knowledge
of the native character and languages, a man of broad views, and, above
all, one who would, to a certain extent, sympathise with the natives,
and inspire them with confidence and enlist their assistance.As a rule,
the Englishman, the Government official, the _Sahib Bahadoor_, although
respected, is at the same time too much feared, and the truth would be
more or less concealed from him.I formed this opinion when I heard of
the circumstances which are supposed to have led to the assassination of
Major Neill.If true, we have here secret incitement to murder handed
down for generations, and our Government, with its extensive police and
its Thuggee Department, knowing nothing about it![56]

FOOTNOTES:

[53] Major Neill _was_ a son of Brigadier-General Neill commanding at
Cawnpore during the first relief of Lucknow.General Neill went to the
front as colonel commanding the First Madras Fusiliers.[54] Workman; in this case a blacksmith.[55] "Some of the incidents related by Mr.Forbes-Mitchell, and now for
the first time brought to light in his most interesting series of
Reminiscences, are of so sensational an order that we are not surprised
that many persons to whom the narrator is a stranger should regard them
with a certain incredulity.We may take this opportunity therefore of
stating that, so far as it is possible at this date to corroborate
incidents that occurred thirty-five years ago, Mr.Forbes-Mitchell has
afforded us ample proof of the accuracy of his memory and the general
correctness of his facts.In the case under notice, we have been shown
the leaflet in which Mazar Ali's cold-blooded murder of his commanding
officer is vindicated, and of which the English translation above given
is an exact reproduction.The leaflet bears no evidence whatever to
disclose its origin, but we see no reason to doubt that, as Mr.Forbes-Mitchell's informant declared, it was widely circulated in the
bazaars of Upper India shortly after Mazar Ali paid the penalty of his
crime with his own life."--ED._Calcutta Statesman._

[56] The _vendetta_ is such a well-known institution among the Pathans,
that no further explanation of Major Neill's murder by the son of a man
who was executed by the Major's father's orders is necessary.APPENDIX B

EUROPEANS AMONG THE REBELS


Although recollections of the Mutiny are fast being obliterated by the
kindly hand of time, there must still be many readers who will remember
the reports current in the newspapers of the time, and elsewhere in 1857
and 1858, of Europeans being seen in the ranks of the rebels.In a
history of _The Siege of Delhi, by an Officer who served there_ (name
not given), published by Adam and Charles Black, Edinburgh, 1861, the
following passages occur.After describing the battle of
Budlee-ke-Serai, the writer goes on to say: "The brave old Afghan chief,
Jan Fishan Khan,[57] who with some horsemen had followed our star from
Meerut, was heard crying out, his stout heart big with the enthusiasm of
the moment: 'Another such day, and I shall become a Christian!'"And in
his comments on this the writer says: "And sad to tell, a European
deserter from Meerut had been struck down fighting in the sepoy ranks,
and was recognised by his former comrades."After describing the opening
of the siege and the general contempt which the Europeans had for the
enemy's artillery, the writer states that the tone of conversation in
the camp was soon changed, and "From being an object of contempt, their
skill became one of wonder and admiration, perhaps too great.Some
artillery officers protested that their practice was better than our
own.Many believed that their fire was under the superintendence of
Europeans.Two men with solar helmets could be seen, by the help of our
best glasses, in their batteries, but no one who knew how much of the
work in India was really done by natives, wondered at the practical
skill they now showed."Turning from Delhi to Lucknow, many will
remember the account of the disastrous action at Chinhut by Mr.He
says: "The masses of the rebel cavalry by which the British were
outflanked near the Kookrail bridge, were apparently commanded by some
European who was seen waving his sword and attempting to make his men
follow him and dash at ours.He was a handsome-looking man, well-built,
fair, about twenty-five years of age, with light moustaches, wearing the
undress uniform of a European cavalry officer, with a blue, gold-laced
cap on his head."Rees suggests the possibility of this person
having been either a Russian or a renegade Christian.The only other case to which I will allude came under my own
observation.I have told in my fourteenth chapter how Brigadier Adrian
Hope was killed in the abortive attack on the fort of Rooyah, by a shot
fired from a high tree inside the fort, and how it was commonly believed
that the man who fired the shot was a European.I myself thought at the
time that such was the case, and now I am convinced of it.I was the
non-commissioned officer of a party of the Ninety-Third sent to cover an
engineer-officer who had either volunteered or been ordered to take a
sketch of one of the fort gates and its approaches, in the hope of being
able to blow it in, and thus gain an entrance to the fort, which was
surrounded by a deep ditch, and inside the ditch an almost impenetrable
belt of prickly bamboos about ten yards in breadth, so interwoven and
full of thorns that a cat could scarcely have passed through it.Under
the guidance of a native of the Intelligence Department, we managed to
advance unseen, and got under cover of a thick clump of bamboos near the
gate.Strict orders had been given that no one on any account whatever
was to speak, much less to fire a shot, unless we should be attacked,
for fear of drawing attention to our proceedings, till the engineer had
had time to make a rough sketch of the position of the gate and its
approaches.During this time we were so close to the fort that we could
hear the enemy talking inside; and the man who was on the tree could be
seen and heard by us quite plainly, calling to the stormers on the other
face in unmistakable barrack-room English: "Come on, you ----
Highlanders!you have a harder nut to crack than eating
oatmeal porridge.If you can come through these bamboos we'll warm your
---- for you, if you come in here!"In short, the person
talking showed such a command of English slang and barrack-room abuse
that it was clear he was no native.Every one of my party was convinced
that the speaker was a European, and if we had been aware at the time
that this man had just killed Brigadier Hope he would certainly have
paid the penalty with his own life; but we knew nothing of this till we
retired, and found that the stormers had been recalled, with the
butcher's bill already given.The events above related had almost passed from my recollection, till
they were recalled by the following circumstance.A vacancy having
occurred among the _durwans_[58] in the factory under my charge, among
several candidates brought by the _jemadar_[59] for the vacant post was
a fine-looking old man, who gave me an unmistakable military salute in
the old style, square from the shoulder--quite different from the
present mongrel German salute, which the English army has taken to
imitating since the Germans beat their old conquerors, the French; I
mean the present mode of saluting with the palm of the hand turned to
the front.As soon as I saw this old man I knew he had been a soldier;
my heart warmed to him at once, and I determined to give him the vacant
appointment.So turning to him I said: "You have served in the army; are
you one of the sepoys of 1857?"He at once admitted that he had formerly
belonged to the Ninth Native Infantry, and that he was present with the
regiment when it mutinied at Allyghur on the 20th of May, 1857.He had
accompanied the regiment to Delhi, and had fought against the English
throughout the siege, and afterwards at Lucknow and throughout the Oude
campaigns."But, _Sahib_" said he, "the Ninth Regiment were almost the
only regiment which did not murder their officers.We gave each of them
three months' pay in advance from the treasury, and escorted them and
their families within a safe distance of Agra before we went to Delhi,
and all of us who lived to come through the Mutiny were pardoned by the
Government."I knew this to be the truth, and ordered the _jemadar_ to
enrol the applicant, by name Doorga, or Doorga Sing, late sepoy of the
Ninth Native Infantry, as one of the factory _durwans_, determining to
have many a talk with him on his experiences of the Mutiny.Many of my readers may recollect that, after escorting their European
officers to the vicinity of Agra, the Ninth Regiment went to Delhi, and
throughout the siege the men of this regiment proved the most daring
opponents of the British Army.According to Mead's _Sepoy Revolt_, "The
dead bodies of men bearing the regimental number of the Ninth Regiment
were found in the front line of every severe engagement around Delhi and
at the deadly Cashmere Gate when it was finally stormed."After engaging
Doorga Sing it was not long before I made him relate his experiences of
the siege of Delhi, and afterwards at Lucknow and in Oude, and one day I
happened to ask him if it was true that there were several Europeans in
the rebel army.He told me that he had heard of several, but that he
personally knew of two only, one of whom accompanied the mutineers from
Meerut and was killed at the battle of Budlee-ke-Serai,--evidently the
deserter alluded to above.The other European was a man of superior
stamp, who came to Delhi from Rohilcund with the Bareilly Brigade, and
the King gave him rank in the rebel army next to General Bukht Khan, the
titular Commander-in-Chief, This European commanded the artillery
throughout the siege of Delhi, as he had formerly been in the Company's
artillery and knew the drill better than any man in the rebel army.I
asked Doorga Sing if he had ever heard his name or what rank he held
before the Mutiny, and he said he had heard his name at the time, but
had forgotten it, and that before the Mutiny he had held the rank of
sergeant-major, but whether in the native artillery or in one of the
native infantry regiments at Bareilly he did not now recollect.But the
Badshah promoted him to be general of artillery immediately on the
arrival of the Bareilly Brigade, and he was by far the bravest and most
energetic commander that the rebels had, and the most esteemed by the
revolted sepoys, whose respect he retained to the last.Even after they
had ceased saluting their native officers they continued to turn out
guards and present arms to the European _sahib_.Throughout the siege of
Delhi there was never a day passed that this man did not visit every
battery, and personally correct the elevation of the guns.He fixed the
sites and superintended the erection of all new batteries to counteract
the fire of the English as the siege advanced.On the day of the
assault, the 14th of September, he fought like _shaitan_,[60] fighting
himself and riding from post to post, trying to rally defeated sepoys,
and bringing up fresh troops to the support of assailed points.Doorga
Sing's company had formed the guard at the Cashmere Gate, and he vividly
described the attack and defence of that post, and how completely the
sepoys were surprised and the powder-bags fixed to the gate before the
sentries of the guard were aware of the advance of the English.After the assault Doorga Sing did not see the European till the beaten
army reached Muttra, when he again found him superintending the
arrangements for crossing the Jumna.About thirty thousand sepoys had
collected there in their retreat from Delhi, a common danger holding
them together, under the command of Bukht Khan and Feroze Shah.But they
paid more respect to the European, and obeyed his orders with far more
alacrity than they did those of Bukht Khan or any other of their nominal
leaders.After crossing the Jumna the European remained with the rebels
till they reached a safe retreat on the Oude side of the Ganges, when he
left the force in company with the Raja of Surajpore, a petty state on
the Oude side about twenty or twenty-five miles above Cawnpore.About
this time my informant, Doorga Sing, having been wounded at Delhi, left
the rebel army _en route_ to Lucknow, and returned to his village near
Onao in Oude; but hearing of the advance of the English, and expecting
no mercy, he and several others repaired to Lucknow, and rejoined their
old comrades.He did not again see the European till after the fall of Lucknow, when
he met him at Fort Rooyah, where he commanded the sepoys, and was the
principal adviser of the Raja Nirput Singh, whom he prevented from
accepting the terms offered by the English through General Walpole.I am
fully convinced that this was the man whom we saw in the tree, and who
was reported to have killed Brigadier Hope.After their retreat from Rooyah the sepoys, under this European,
remained in the jungles till the English army had passed on to Bareilly,
when they reattacked Shahjehanpore, and would have retaken it, if a
brigade had not arrived from Bareilly to its relief.After being driven
back from Shahjehanpore the sepoys held together in Mahomdee, Sitapore,
and elsewhere, throughout the hot season of 1858, mostly under the
guidance of the European and Bukht Khan.The last time Doorga Sing saw
the renegade was after the battle of Nawabgunge in Oude, where Bukht
Khan was killed and a large number of the sepoys were driven across the
Raptee into Nepaul territory, upon which they held a council among
themselves and determined to follow their leaders no longer, but to give
themselves up to the nearest English post under the terms of the Queen's
proclamation.The European tried to dissuade them from doing this,
telling them that if they gave themselves up they would all be hanged
like dogs or sent in chains across the _Kala Pani_.[61] But they had
already suffered too much to be further imposed upon, and one of their
number, who had gone to get information about other parties who were
known to have given themselves up to the English, returned at this time
with information that all sepoys who had not taken part in murdering
their officers were, after giving up their arms, provided with a pass
and paid two rupees each, and allowed to return to their villages.On
this the greater part of the sepoys, including all left alive of the
Ninth Regiment, told the European that they had resolved to listen to
him no longer, but to return to their villages and their families, after
giving themselves up at the nearest English post.Thereupon the _sahib_
sat down and commenced to shed tears, saying _he_ had neither home nor
country to return to.There he was left, with a few more whose crimes
had placed them beyond the hope of pardon; and that was the last which
Doorga Sing saw or heard of the European general of the mutineer
artillery.Before writing this, I have often cross-questioned Doorga Sing about
this European, and his statements never vary.He says that the time is
now so long past that he could not be sure of the _sahib's_ name even if
he heard it; but he is positive he came from Bareilly, and that his rank
before the Mutiny was sergeant-major, and that he had formerly been in
the Company's artillery.He thinks, however, that at the time of the
Mutiny this sergeant was serving with one of the native infantry
regiments in Bareilly; and he further recollects that it was commonly
reported in the sepoy ranks that when the Mutiny broke out this
sergeant-major had advised the murder of all the European officers,
himself shooting the adjutant of the regiment with his own hand to prove
his loyalty to the rebel cause.The whole narrative is so extraordinary that I publish it with a view to
discovering if there are any still living who can give facts bearing on
this strange, but, I am convinced, true story.Doorga Sing promised to
find for me one or two other mutineer sepoys who knew more about this
European and his antecedents than he himself did.I have no detailed
statement of the Mutiny at Bareilly, and the short account which I
possess merely says that, "As soon as the artillery fired the signal gun
in their lines, Brigadier Sibbald mounted his horse and galloped off to
the cavalry lines, but was met on the way by a party of infantry, who
fired on him.He received a bullet in his chest, and then turned his
horse and galloped to the appointed rendezvous for the Europeans, and,
on arriving there, dropped dead from his horse."The account then goes
on to say: "The European sergeant-major had remained in the lines, and
Adjutant Tucker perished while endeavouring to save the life of the
sergeant-major."The question arises--Is it possible that this
sergeant-major can have been the same man whom Doorga Sing afterwards
met in command of the rebel ranks in Delhi, and who was said to have
killed his adjutant?FOOTNOTES:

A FEW WORDS ON SWORD-BLADES


A short time back I read an article on sword-blades, reprinted I believe
from some English paper.Now, in a war like the Mutiny sword-blades are
of the utmost importance to men who depend on them either for taking or
preserving life; I will therefore state my own experience, and give
opinions on the swords which came under my observation, and I may at
once say that I think there is great room for improvement in our blades
of Birmingham manufacture.I consider that the swords supplied to our
officers, cavalry and artillery, are far inferior as weapons of offence
to a really good Oriental _tulwar_.Although an infantry man I saw a
good deal of sword-practice, because all the men who held the
Secundrabagh and the Begum's Kothee were armed with native _tulwars_
from the King of Oude's armoury, in addition to their muskets and
bayonets, and a large proportion of our men were killed and wounded by
sword-cuts.In the first place, then, for cutting our English regulation swords are
too straight; the Eastern curved blade is far more effective as a
cutting weapon.Secondly, our English swords are far too blunt, whereas
the native swords are as keen in edge as a well-stropped razor.Our
steel scabbards again are a mistake for carrying sharp blades; and, in
addition to this, I don't think our mounted branches who are armed with
swords have proper appliances given to them for sharpening their edges.Even in time of peace, but especially in time of war, more attention
ought to be given to this point, and every soldier armed with a sword
ought to be supplied with the means of sharpening it, and made to keep
it with an edge like a razor.I may mention that this fact was noticed
in the wars of the Punjab, notably at Ramnugger, where our English
cavalry with their blunt swords were most unequally matched against the
Sikhs with _tulwars_ so keen of edge that they would split a hair.I remember reading of a regiment of British cavalry charging a regiment
of Sikh cavalry.The latter wore voluminous thick _puggries_ round their
heads, which our blunt swords were powerless to cut through, and each
horseman had also a buffalo-hide shield slung on his back.They
evidently knew that the British swords were blunt and useless, so they
kept their horses still and met the British charge by lying flat on
their horses' necks,[62] with their heads protected by the thick turban
and their backs by the shields; and immediately the British soldiers
passed through their ranks the Sikhs swooped round on them and struck
them back-handed with their sharp, curved swords, in several instances
cutting our cavalry men in two.In one case a British officer, who was
killed in the charge I describe, was hewn in two by a back-handed stroke
which cut right through an ammunition-pouch, cleaving the pistol-bullets
right through the pouch and belt, severing the officer's backbone and
cutting his heart in two from behind.It was the same in the Balaclava
charge, both with the Heavy and the Light Brigade.Their swords were too
straight, and so blunt that they would not cut through the thick coats
and sheep-skin caps of the Russians; so that many of our men struck with
the hilts at the faces of the enemy, as more effective than attempting
to cut with their blunt blades.In the article on English sword-blades to which I have referred, stress
is laid on the superiority of blades of spring steel, tempered so that
the tip can be bent round to the hilt without breaking or preventing the
blade assuming the straight immediately it is released.Now my
observations lead me to consider spring steel to be totally unfitted for
a sword-blade.The real Damascus blade that we have all read about, but
so few have seen, is as rigid as cast-iron, without any spring
whatever,--as rigid as the blade of a razor.The sword-blade which bends
is neither good for cut nor thrust, even in the hands of the most expert
and powerful swordsman.A blade of spring steel will not cut through the
bone; directly it encounters a hard substance, it quivers in the hand
and will not cut through.Let any sword-maker in Birmingham try
different blades in the hands of an expert swordsman on a green tree of
soft wood, and the rigid blade of well-tempered steel will cut four
times as deep as the blade of highly tempered spring steel which you can
bend into a circle, tip to hilt.My opinion is that the motto of a
sword-blade ought to be the same as the Duke of Sutherland's--"_Frangas
non flectes_, Thou mayest break but not bend"; and if blades could be
made that would neither break nor bend, so much the better.I believe that the manufacture of real Damascus steel blades is a lost
art.When serving in the Punjab about thirty years ago, I was well
acquainted with an old man in Lahore who had been chief armourer to
Runjeet Sing, and he has often told me that the real Damascus blades
contained a large percentage of arsenic amalgamated with the steel while
the blades were being forged, which greatly added to their hardness,
toughness, and strength, preserved the steel from rust, and enabled the
blades to be sharpened to a very fine edge.This old man's test for a
sword-blade was to get a good-sized fish, newly caught from the river,
lay it on a soft, yielding bed,--cotton quilt folded up, or any soft
yielding substance,--and the blade that did not cut the fish in two
across the thickest part behind the gills, cutting against the scales,
at one stroke, was considered of no account whatever.From what I have
seen no sword-blade that bends, however sharp it may be, will do that,
because the spring in the steel causes the blade to glance off the fish,
and the impetus of the cut is lost by the blade quivering in the hand.Nor will any of our straight sword-blades cut a large fish through in
this manner; whereas the curved Oriental blade, with a drawing cut,
severs it at once, because the curved blade presents much more cutting
surface.One revolution of a circular saw cuts much deeper into wood
than one stroke of a straight saw, although the length of the straight
saw may be equal to the circumference of the circular one.So it is with
sword-blades.A stroke from a curved blade, drawn through, cuts far
deeper than the stroke from a straight blade.[63]

I will mention one instance at Lucknow that came under my own notice of
the force of a sword-cut from a curved sword of rigid steel.There were
three brothers of the name of Ready in the Ninety-Third called David,
James, and John.They were all powerful, tall men, in the prime of life,
and all three had served through the Crimea.David was a sergeant, and
his two brothers were privates.When falling in for the assault on the
Begum's palace, John Ready took off his Crimean medal and gave it to his
brother David, telling him that he felt a presentiment that he would be
killed in that attack, and that David had better keep his medal, and
send it home to their mother.David tried to reason him out of his
fears, but to no purpose.John Ready replied that he had no fear, and
his mother might know that he had died doing his duty.Well, the assault
took place, and in the inner courts of the palace there was one division
held by a regiment of dismounted cavalry, armed with swords as keen as
razors, and circular shields, and the party of the Ninety-Third who got
into that court were far out-numbered on this occasion, as in fact we
were everywhere else.On entering James Ready was attacked by a _sowar_
armed with sword and shield.Ready's feather bonnet was knocked off, and
the _sowar_ got one cut at him, right over his head, which severed his
skull clean in two, the sword cutting right through his neck and
half-way down through the breast-bone.John Ready sprang to the
assistance of his brother, but too late; and although his bayonet
reached the side of his opponent and was driven home with a fatal
thrust, in doing so he came within the swoop of the same terrible sword,
wielded by the powerful arm of a tall man, and he also was cut right
through the left shoulder diagonally across the chest, and his head and
right arm were clean severed from the body.The _sowar_ delivered his
stroke of the sword at the same moment that he received the bayonet of
John Ready through his heart, and both men fell dead together.David
Ready, the sergeant, seized the _tulwar_ that had killed both his
brothers, and used it with terrible effect, cutting off heads of men as
if they had been mere heads of cabbage.When the fight was over I
examined that sword.It was of ordinary weight, well-balanced, curved
about a quarter-circle, as sharp as the sharpest razor, and the blade as
rigid as cast-iron.Now, my experience is that none of our very best
English swords could have cut like this one.A sword of that quality
would cut through a man's skull or thigh-bone without the least quiver,
as easily as an ordinary Birmingham blade would cut through a willow.I may also mention the case of a young officer named Banks, of the
Seventh Hussars, who was terribly cut up in charging through a band of
Ghazis.One leg was clean lopped off above the knee, the right arm cut
off, the left thigh and left arm both cut through the bone, each wound
produced by a single cut from a sharp, curved _tulwar_.I don't know if
the young fellow got over it;[64] but he was reported to be still alive,
and even cheerful when we marched from Lucknow.In this matter of sword-blades, I have no wish to dogmatise or to pose
as an authority; I merely state my observations and opinion, in the
hopes that they may lead to experiments being made.The sharpening of our cavalry swords, if still the same as
in 1857, receives far too little attention.FOOTNOTES:

[62] In which case they would have been simply ridden over.Mitchell's are quite true as regards curved
swords; but he forgets that the _point_ is the most effective attack
against Eastern swordsmen.APPENDIX D

THE OPIUM QUESTION


On the afternoon of the 19th August, 1892, I left Cawnpore for Lucknow.As I was a few minutes before time, I walked along the railway-platform
to see the engine, and, strange to relate, the engine attached to the
train which was to take me into Lucknow (under circumstances very
different from those of 1857) was No.In 1857 I had crossed the
Ganges in the ranks of the Ninety-Third Highlanders, with the figures 93
on the front of my cap, and here I was, under very different
circumstances, revisiting Lucknow for the first time thirty-five years
after, and the engine to the train was No.I need not say that I
lifted my hat to that engine.As a matter of fact, I never do pass the
old number without giving it a salute; but in this instance I looked
upon it as a happy omen for the success of my journey.I took my seat in the carriage, and shortly after was joined by a
gentleman whom I took to be a Mahommedan; but to my surprise he told me
that he was a Christian employed in the Educational Department, and that
he was going to Lucknow for a month's holiday.He appeared to be a man
of over sixty years of age, but said he was only fifty-four, and that he
would retire from Government service next year.Of course I introduced
the subject of the Mutiny, and asked him where he had been at the time.He stated that when the Mutiny broke out he was at school in Bareilly,
and that he was then a Mahommedan, but did not join in the rebellion;
that on the outbreak of the Mutiny, when all the Europeans were either
killed or fled from Bareilly, he had retired to his village near
Shahjehanpore, and remained there till order was re-established on the
advance of the English into Rohilcund in May, 1858, after Khan Bahadoor
Khan had reigned in Bareilly twelve months.In course of conversation I asked my companion if he could give any
reason why it was that the whole rural population of Oude had joined the
urban population against the British in 1857, whereas on the south side
of the Ganges the villagers were in favour of the British, where they
were not overawed by the mutineers?He told me a strange thing, and that
was that he was fully convinced that the main reason why the village
population of Oude joined the city population of Lucknow was owing to
the oppression caused by our introduction of the opium-tax among the
people.At first I misunderstood him, and thought I had come across an agent of
the Anti-Opium Society."So you are against Government control of the
opium-cultivation and sale of the drug," I said."I consider the tax on opium a most legitimate source of
revenue.What I mean is that although a just tax, it was a highly
obnoxious one to the citizens of Lucknow and the rural population of
Oude at the time of the Mutiny."He went on to state that although a
Christian convert from Mahommedanism and a strictly temperate man, he
had no sympathy with the anti-opium party; that he considered them a
most dangerous set of fanatics, who would set the whole country in
rebellion again before a twelve-month if they could get the Government
to adopt their narrow-minded views.Regarding 1857, he continued, and I
quote his exact words, as I noted them down immediately after I got to
the hotel:

"Under the rule of the Nawabs of Lucknow many taxes were imposed, which
were abolished by the British; but in their stead the opium-tax was
introduced, which was the most unpopular tax that could have been
devised, because it touched every one, from the _coolie_ in the bazaar
to the noble in his palace.Before the annexation of Oude opium was
untaxed, and was largely consumed by all classes of the people, both in
the capital and in the villages.Though the mass of the people were
well-affected to British rule in general, disloyal agitators had merely
to cite the opium-tax as a most obnoxious and oppressive impost, to
raise the whole population against the British Government, and the same
would be the case again, if ever the British Government were weak enough
to be led by the Anti-Opium Society.""Then," said I, "since you are so much against the Anti-Opium Society, I
suppose you are also against Christian missionaries.""That by no means
follows," was the answer."Many of our most Christian and able
missionaries have as little sympathy with the anti-opium propagandists
as I have.The true missionary aims at reforming the people through the
people, not by compelling moral reformation through the Government,
which would be merely a return to the Inquisition of Rome in another
form.I would encourage missionaries by every possible means; but they
must be broad-minded, earnest, pious men, who mind their own business,
and on no pretence whatever attempt to dictate to Government, or to
control its action either in the matter of taxation or in any other way.I would never encourage men who go about the country railing against the
Government for collecting revenue from one of the most just sources that
can be named.Missionaries of experience know that the mass of the
population are miserably poor, and a pill of opium is almost the only
stimulant in which they indulge.Then, why attempt to deprive them of
it, merely to please a score or so of sentimental faddists?Let the
missionaries mind their own business, and render to Caesar the things
which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's.Let them
confine themselves to proclaiming the Gospel to the heathen, and teach
the Bible in their schools; but don't allow them to mix in politics, or
in any way interfere with the government or taxation of the country.I
would throw the English education of the people more into the hands of
the missionaries.Our Government schools are antichristian, and are
making infidels of the people."THE END

confidence of the family in his ability.They are ready to believe that
the patient's condition is critical, and in terror, wanting the help of
everything that promises help, call in a doctor of some "new school"
because neighbors told how he performed wonderful cures in their families.When the patient recovers speedily, as he would have done with no
treatment of any kind, and just as the shyster M.D.thought he would, the
glory and credit of curing a "bad case" of a "dangerous disease" go to the
new system instead of redounding to the glory of Dr.Shyster, as he
planned it would.Is it any wonder true physicians sometimes get disgusted with their
profession when they see a shyster come into the town where they have
worked for years, patiently and conscientiously building up a legitimate
practice that begins to promise a decent living, and by such quack methods
as diagnosing cases of simple fever, such as might come from acute
indigestion or too much play in children, as something dangerous, typhoid
or "threatened typhoid," or cases of congestion of the lungs as "lung
fever," and by "aborting" or "curing" these terrible diseases in short
order and having his patients out in a few days, jumps into fame and
(financial) success at a bound?Because the typhoid (real typhoid)
patients of the honest doctor lingered for weeks and sometimes died, and
because frequently he lost a case of real pneumonia, he made but a poor
showing in comparison with the new doctor."He's just fresh from school,
you know, from a post-graduate course in the East."Or, "He's been to the
old country and _knows_ something."Just as if any physician, though he
may have been out of school for many years, does not, or may not, know of
all the curative agencies of demonstrated merit!Would a medical journal fail to keep its readers posted concerning any new
discovery in medicine, or helpful appliance that promises real good to the
profession?Yet people speak of one doctor's superior knowledge of the
best treatment of a particular disease as if that doctor had access to
some mysterious source of therapeutic knowledge unknown to other
physicians.It is becoming less easy to work the "dangerous diagnosis"
graft than formerly, for many people are learning that certain diseases
must "run their course," and that there are no medicines that have
specific curative effects on them.There is another graft now that is taking the place of the one just
mentioned, to some extent at least.In the hands of a fellow with lots of
nerve and little conscience it is the greatest of them all.This is the
graft of the smart young fellow direct from a post-graduate course in the
clinics of some great surgeon.He comes to town with a great flourish of trumpets.Of course, he observes
the ethics of the profession!The long accounts of his superior education
and unusual experience with operative surgery are only legitimate items of
news for the local papers.It is only right that such an
unusual doctor should have so much attention.There is no "starving time" for him.No weary wait of years for patients
to come.At one bound he leaps into fame and fortune by performing "big
operations" right and left, when before his coming such cases were only
occasionally found, and then taken to surgeons of known ability and
experience.The reputable physician respects surgery, and would respect
the bright young fellow fresh from contact with the latest approved
methods who has nerve to undertake the responsibility of a dangerous
operation when such an operation is really indicated.But when it comes to
mutilating the human body by cutting away an appendix or an ovary because
it is known that to remove them when neither they nor the victim are much
diseased is a comparatively safe and very _quick_ way to get a big
reputation--that is the limit of quackery.And no wonder such a man is so
cordially hated by his brethren.He not always hated because he mutilates
humanity so much, as because his spectacular graft in surgery is sure to
be taken as proof conclusive that he is superior in all other departments
of therapeutics.And it puzzles observing laymen sometimes to know why all the successful
(?)operations are considered such desirable items of news, while the
cases that are not flattering in their outcome pass unmentioned.I find most complete corroboration of my contention in the president's
address, delivered before the Western Surgical and Gynecological
Association at St.Louis, in 1907, by Charles W. Oviatt, M.D.This address
was published in the _Journal of the American Medical Association_, and I
herewith reprint it in part:

    "The ambitious medical student does not usually get far into college
    work before he aspires to become a surgeon.He sees in the surgical
    clinics more definite and striking results than are discernible in
    other branches.Without being able to judge of his own relative
    fitness or whether he possesses the special aptitude so essential to
    success, he decides to become a surgeon.There will always be room for
    the young surgeon who, fitted by nature for the work, takes the time
    and opportunity to properly prepare himself.There is more good
    surgery being done to-day than ever before, and there are more good
    surgeons being educated to do the work.If, however, the surgeon of
    the future is to hold the high and honorable position our leaders have
    held in the past, there must be some standard of qualification
    established that shall protect the people against incompetency and
    dishonesty in surgeons."That there is much that passes under the name of surgery being done
    by ill-trained, incompetent men, will not be denied.What standard,
    then, should be established, and what requirement should be made
    before one should be permitted to do surgery?In his address as
    chairman of the Section on Surgery and Anatomy of the American Medical
    Association, at the Portland (1905) meeting, Dr.Maurice H. Richardson
    deals with this subject in such a forceful, clear-cut way, that I take
    the liberty to quote him at some length:

        "'The burden of the following remarks is that those only should
        practice surgery who by education in the laboratory, in the
        dissecting-room, by the bedside, and at the operating-table, are
        qualified, first, to make reasonably correct deductions from
        subjective and objective signs; secondly, to give sound advice for
        or against operations; thirdly, to perform operations skillfully
        and quickly, and, fourthly, to conduct wisely the after-treatment."'The task before me is a serious criticism of what is going on in
        every community.I do not single out any community or any man.There is in my mind no doubt whatever that surgery is being
        practiced by those who are incompetent to practice it--by those
        whose education is imperfect, who lack natural aptitude, whose
        environment is such that they never can gain that personal
        experience which alone will really fit them for what surgery means
        to-day.They are unable to make correct deductions from histories;
        to predict probable events; to perform operations skillfully, or
        to manage after-treatment."'All surgeons are liable to error, not only in diagnosis, but in
        the performance of operations based on diagnosis.Such errors must
        always be expected and included in the contingencies of the
        practice of medicine and surgery.Doubtless many of my hearers can
        recall cases of their own in which useless--or worse than
        useless--operations have been performed.If, however, serious
        operations are in the hands of men of large experience, such
        errors will be reduced to a minimum."'Many physicians send patients for diagnosis and opinion as to
        the advisability of operation without telling the consultant that
        they themselves are to perform the operation.The diagnosis is
        made and the operation perhaps recommended, when it appears that
        the operation is to be in incompetent hands.His advice should be
        conditional that it be carried out only by the competent.Many
        operations, like the removal of the vermiform appendix in the
        period of health, the removal of fibroids which are not seriously
        offending, the removal of gall-stones that are not causing
        symptoms, are operations of choice rather than of necessity; they
        are operations which should never be advised unless they are to be
        performed by men of the greatest skill.Furthermore, many
        emergency operations, such as the removal of an inflamed appendix
        and other operations for lesions which are not necessarily
        fatal--should be forbidden and the patient left to the chances of
        spontaneous recovery, if the operation proposed is to be performed
        by an incompetent."'And is not the surgeon, appreciating his own unfitness in spite
        of years of devotion, in the position to condemn those who lightly
        take up such burdens without preparation and too often without
        conscience?"'In view of these facts, who should perform surgery?How shall
        the surgeon be best fitted for these grave duties?As a matter of
        right and wrong, who shall, in the opinion of the medical
        profession, advise and perform these responsible acts and who
        shall not?Surgical operations should be performed only by those
        who are educated for that special purpose."'I have no hesitation in saying that the proper fitting of a man
        for surgical practice requires a much longer experience as a
        student and assistant than the most exacting schools demand.A man
        should serve four, five or six years as assistant to an active
        surgeon.During this period of preparation, as it were, as much
        time as possible should be given to observing the work of the
        masters of surgery throughout the world.'Richardson's ideal may seem almost utopian, there being so
    wide a difference between the standard he would erect and the one
    generally established, we must all agree that however impossible of
    attainment under present conditions, such an ideal is none too high
    and its future realization not too much to hope for."While there is being done enough poor surgery that is honest and well
    intended, there is much being done that is useless, conscienceless,
    and done for purely commercial ends.This is truly a disagreeable and
    painful topic and one that I would gladly pass by, did I not feel that
    its importance demands some word of condemnation coming through such
    representative surgical organizations as this."The spirit of graft that has pervaded our ranks, especially here in
    the West, is doing much to lower the standard and undermine the morals
    and ethics of the profession.When fee-splitting and the paying of
    commissions for surgical work began to be heard of something like a
    decade ago, it seemed so palpably dishonest and wrong that it was
    believed that it would soon die out, or be at least confined to the
    few in whom the inherited commercial instinct was so strong that they
    could not get away from it.But it did not die; on the other hand, it
    has grown and flourished."In looking for an explanation for the existence of this evil, I think
    several factors must be taken into account, among them being certain
    changes in our social and economic conditions.This is an age of
    commercialism.We are known to the world as a nation of "dollar
    chasers," where nearly everything that should contribute to right
    living is sacrificed to the Moloch of money.The mad rush for wealth
    which has characterized the business world, has in a way induced some
    medical men, whether rightfully or wrongfully, to adopt the same
    measures in self-protection.The patient or his friends too often
    insist on measuring the value of our services with a commercial
    yard-stick, the fee to be paid being the chief consideration.In this
    way the public must come in for its share of responsibility for
    existing conditions.So long as there are people who care so little
    who operates on them, just so long will there be cheap surgeons, cheap
    in every respect, to supply the demand.The demand for better
    physicians and surgeons must come in part from those who employ their
    services."Another source of the graft evil is the existence of low-grade,
    irregular and stock-company medical schools.In many of these schools
    the entrance requirements are not in evidence outside of their
    catalogues.With no standard of character or ethics, these schools
    turn out men who have gotten the little learning they possess in the
    very atmosphere of graft.The existence of these schools seems less
    excusable when we consider that our leading medical colleges rank with
    the best in the world and are ample for the needs of all who should
    enter the profession.Their constant aim is to still further elevate
    the standard and to admit as students only those who give unmistakable
    evidence of being morally and intellectually fit to become members of
    the profession."Enough men of character, however, are entering the field through
    these better schools to ensure the upholding of those lofty ideals
    that have characterized the profession in the past and which are
    essential to our continued progress.I think, therefore, that we may
    take a hopeful view of the future.The demand for better prepared
    physicians will eventually close many avenues that are now open to
    students, greatly to the benefit of all.With the curtailing of the
    number of students and a less fierce competition which this will
    bring, there will be less temptation, less necessity, if you will, on
    the part of general practitioners to ask for a division of fees.He
    will come to see that honest dealing on his part with the patient
    requiring special skill will in the long run be the best policy.He
    will make a just, open charge for the services he has rendered and not
    attempt to collect a surreptitious fee through a dishonest surgeon for
    services he has not rendered and could not render.Then, too, there
    will be less inducement and less opportunity for incompetent and
    conscienceless men to disgrace the art of surgery."The public mind is becoming especially active just at this time in
    combating graft in all forms, and is ready to aid in its destruction.The intelligent portion of the laity is becoming alive to the patent
    medicine evil.It is only a question of time when the people will
    demand that the secular papers which go into our homes shall not
    contain the vile, disgusting and suggestive quack advertisements that
    are found to-day.A campaign of reform is being instituted against
    dishonest politicians, financiers, railroad and insurance magnates,
    showing that their methods will be no longer tolerated.The moral
    standards set for professional men and men in public life are going to
    be higher in the future, and with the limelight of public opinion
    turned on the medical and surgical grafter, the evil will cease to
    exist.Hand in hand with this reform let us hope that there will come
    to be established a legal and moral standard of qualification for
    those who assume to do surgery."I feel sure that it is the wish of every member of this association
    to do everything possible to hasten the coming of this day and to aid
    in the uplifting of the art of surgery.Our individual effort in this
    direction must lie largely through the influence we exert over those
    who seek our advice before beginning the study of medicine, and over
    those who, having entered the work, are to follow in our immediate
    footsteps.To the young man who seeks our counsel as to the
    advisability of commencing the study of medicine, it is our duty to
    make a plain statement of what would be expected of him, of the cost
    in time and money, and an estimate of what he might reasonably expect
    as a reward for a life devoted to ceaseless study, toil and
    responsibility.If, from our knowledge of the character, attainments
    and qualifications of the young man we feel that at best he could make
    but a modicum of success in the work, we should endeavor to divert his
    ambition into some other channel."We should advise the 'expectant surgeon' in his preparation to follow
    as nearly as possible the line of study suggested by Richardson.Then
    I would add the advice of Senn, viz: 'To do general practice for
    several years, return to laboratory work and surgical anatomy, attend
    the clinics of different operators, and never cease to be a physician.If this advice is followed there will be less unnecessary operating
    done in the future than has been the case in the past.'The young man
    who enters special work without having had experience as a general
    practitioner, is seriously handicapped.In this age, when we have so
    frequently to deal with the so-called border-line cases, it is
    especially well never to cease being a physician."We would next have the young man assure himself that he is the
    possessor of a well-developed, healthy, working'surgical conscience.'No matter how well qualified he may be, his enthusiasm in the earlier
    years of his work will lead him to do operations that he would refrain
    from in later life.This will be especially true of malignant disease.He knows that early and thorough radical measures alone hold out hope,
    and only by repeated unsuccessful efforts will he learn to temper his
    ambition by the judgment that comes of experience.Pirogoff, the noted
    surgeon, suffered from a malignant growth.Billroth refused to operate
    or advise operation.In writing to another surgeon friend he said: 'I
    am not the bold operator whom you knew years ago in Zurich.Before
    deciding on the necessity of an operation, I always propose to myself
    this question: Would you permit such an operation as you intend
    performing on your patient to be done on yourself?Years and
    experience bring in their train a certain degree of hesitancy.'This,
    coming from one who in his day was the most brilliant operator in the
    world, should be remembered by every surgeon, young and old."In the hands of the skilled,
conscientious surgeon how great are thy powers for good to suffering
humanity!In the hands of shysters "what crimes are committed in thy
name!"With his own school full of shysters and incompetents, and grafters of
"new schools" and "systems" to compete with on every hand, the
conscientious physician seems to be "between the devil and the deep sea!"With quacks to the right of him, quacks to the left of him, quacks in
front of him, all volleying and thundering with their literature to prove
that the old schools, and all schools other than theirs, are frauds,
impostors and poisoners, about all that is left for the layman to do when
sick is to take to the woods.PART TWO

OSTEOPATHY




CHAPTER VII.SOME DEFINITIONS AND HISTORIES.Romantic Story of Osteopathy's Origin--An Asthma Cure--Headache Cured
    by Plowlines--Log Rolling to Relieve Dysentery--Osteopathy is Drugless
    Healing--Osteopathy is Manual Treatment--Liberty of Blood, Nerves and
    Arteries--Perfect Skeletal Alignment and Tonic, Ligamentous, Muscular
    and Facial Relaxation--Andrew T. Still in 1874--Kirksville, Mo., as a
    Mecca--American School of Osteopathy--The Promised Golden Stream of
    Prosperity--Shams and Pretenses--The "Mossbacks"--"Who's Who in
    Osteopathy."The story of the origin of Osteopathy is romantic enough to appeal to the
fancy of impressionists.It is almost as romantic as the finding of the
mysterious stones by the immortal Joe Smith.In this story is embodied the
life history of an old-time doctor and pioneer hero in his restless
migrations about the frontiers of Kansas and Missouri.His thrilling
experiences in the days of border wars and through the Civil War are
narrated, and how the germ of the idea of the true cause and cure of
disease was planted in his mind by the remark of a comrade as the two lay
concealed in a thicket for days to escape border ruffians.Then, later,
how the almost simultaneous death of two or three beloved children, whom
all his medical learning and that of other doctors he had summoned had
been powerless to save, had caused him to renounce forever the belief that
drugs could cure disease.He believed Nature had a true system, and for
this he began a patient search.He wandered here and there, almost in the
condition of the religious reformers of old, who "wandered up and down
clad in sheep-skins and goat-hides, of whom the world was not worthy."In
the name of suffering humanity he desecrated the grave of poor Lo, that he
might read from his red bones some clue to the secret.One Osteopathic journal claims to tell authentically how Still was led to
the discovery of the "great truth."It states that by accidentally curing
a case of asthma by "fooling with the bones of the chest," he was led to
the belief that bones out of normal position cause disease.Still himself tells a rather different story in a popular magazine posing
of late years as a public educator in matters of therapeutics.In this
magazine Still tells how he discovered the principles of Osteopathy by
curing a terrible headache resting the back of his neck across a swing
made of his father's plowlines, and next by writhing on his back across a
log to relieve the pain of dysentery.Accidentally the "lesion" was
corrected, or the proper center "inhibited," and his headache and flux
immediately cured.You can take your choice of these various versions of the wonderful
discovery.Ever since Osteopathy began to attract attention, and people began to
inquire "What is it?"its leading promoters have vied with each other in
trying to construct a good definition for their "great new science."Here are some of the definitions:

"Osteopathy is the science of drugless healing."For a genuine "lesion"
Osteopath that would not do at all.It is too broad and gives too much
scope to the physicians who would do more than "pull bones.""Osteopathy is practical anatomy and physiology skillfully and
scientifically applied as _manual_ treatment of disease."That definition
suits better, because of the "manual treatment."If you are a true
Osteopath you must do it _all_ with your hands.It will not do to use any
mechanical appliances, for if you do you cannot keep up the impression
that you are "handling the body with the skilled touch of a master who
knows every part of his machine.""The human body is a machine run by the unseen force called life, and that
it may run harmoniously it is necessary that there be liberty of blood,
nerves, and arteries from the generating point to destination."This
definition may be impressive to the popular mind, but, upon analysis, we
wonder if any other string of big words might not have had the same
effect."Liberty of blood" is a proposition even a stupid medical man must
admit.Of course, there must be free circulation of blood, and massage, or
hot and cold applications, or exercise, or anything that will stimulate
circulation, is rational.But when "liberty of blood" is mentioned, what
is meant by "liberty of arteries"?"Osteopathy seeks to obtain perfect skeletal alignment and tonic
ligamentous, muscular and facial relaxation."Some Osteopaths and other
therapeutic reformers (?)have contended that medical men purposely used
"big words" and Latin names to confound the laity.What must we think of
the one just given as a popular definition?A good many Osteopaths are becoming disgusted with the big words,
technical terms and "high-sounding nothings" used by so many Osteopathic
writers.The limit of this was never reached, however, until an A.B.,
Ph.D., D.O.wrote an article to elucidate Osteopathy for the general
public in an American encyclopedia.It takes scholarly wisdom to simplify
great truths and bring them to the comprehension of ordinary minds.If
writers for the medical profession want a lesson in the art of simplifying
and popularizing therapeutic science, they should study this article on
Osteopathy in the encyclopedia.A brief history of Osteopathy is perhaps in place.The following summary
is taken from leading Osteopathic journals.As to the personality and
motives of its founders I know but little; of the motives of its leading
promoters a candid public must be the judge.But judgment should be
withheld until all the truth is known.The principles of Osteopathy were discovered by Dr.He was at that time a physician of the old school practicing in
Kansas.His father, brothers and uncles were all medical practitioners.He
was at one time scout surgeon under General Fremont.During the Civil War
he was surgeon in the Union army in a volunteer corps.It was during the
war that he began to lose faith in drugs, and to search for something
natural in combating disease.Then began a long struggle with poverty and abuse.He was obstructed by
his profession and ridiculed by his friends.Fifteen years after the
discovery of Osteopathy found Dr.Still located in the little town of
Kirksville, Mo., where he had gradually attracted a following who had
implicit faith in his power to heal by what to them seemed mysterious
movements.His fame spread beyond the town, and chronic sufferers began to turn
toward Kirksville as a Mecca of healing.Others began to desire Still's
healing powers.In 1892 the American School of Osteopathy was founded,
which from a small beginning has grown until the present buildings and
equipment cost more than $100,000.Hundreds of students are graduated
yearly from this school, and large, well-equipped schools have been
founded in Des Moines, Philadelphia, Boston and California, with a number
of schools of greater or less magnitude scattered in other parts of the
country.More than four thousand Osteopaths were in the field in 1907, and
this number is being augmented every year by a larger number of physicians
than are graduated from Homeopathic colleges, according to Osteopathic
reports.About thirty-five States have given Osteopathy more or less favorable
legal recognition.The discussion of the subject of Osteopathy is of very grave importance.Important to practitioners of the old schools of medicine for reasons I
shall give further on, and of vital importance to the thousands of men and
women who have chosen Osteopathy as their life work.It is even of greater
importance in another sense to the people who are called upon to decide
which system is right, and which school they ought to rely upon when their
lives are at stake.I shall try to speak advisedly and conservatively, as I wish to do no one
injustice.I should be sorry indeed to speak a word that might hinder the
cause of truth and progress.I started out to tell of all that prevents
the sway of truth and honesty in therapeutics.I should come far short of
telling all if I omitted the inconsistencies of this "new science" of
healing that dares to assume the responsibility for human life, and makes
bold to charge that time-tried systems, with their tens of thousands of
practitioners, are wrong, and that the right remedy, or the best remedy
for disease has been unknown through all these years until the coming of
Osteopathy.And further dares to make the still more serious charge that
since the truth has been brought to light, the majority of medical men are
so blinded by prejudice or ignorance that they _will_ not see.This is not the first time I have spoken about inconsistencies in the
practice of Osteopathy.I saw so much of it in a leading Osteopathic
college that when I had finished I could not conscientiously proclaim
myself as an exponent of a "complete and well-rounded system of healing,
adequate for every emergency," as Osteopathy is heralded to be by the
journals published for "Osteopathic physicians" to scatter broadcast among
the people.I practiced Osteopathy for three years, but only as an
Osteopathic specialist.I never during that time accepted responsibility
for human life when I did not feel sure that I could do as much for the
case as any other might do with other means or some other system.Because I practiced as a specialist and would not claim that Osteopathy
would cure everything that any other means might cure, I have never been
called a good disciple of the new science by my brethren.I would not
practice as a grafter, find bones dislocated and "subluxated," and tell
people that they must take two or three months' treatment at twenty-five
dollars per month, to have one or two "subluxations" corrected.In
consequence I was never overwhelmed by the golden stream of prosperity the
literature that made me a convert had assured me would be forthcoming to
all "Osteopathic physicians" of even ordinary ability.As I said, this is not the first time I have spoken of the inconsistencies
of Osteopathy.While yet in active practice I became so disgusted with
some of the shams and pretences that I wrote a long letter to the editor
of an Osteopathic journal published for the good of the profession.This
editor, a bright and capable man, wrote me a nice letter in reply, in
which he agreed with me about quackery and incompetency in our profession.He did not publish the letter I wrote, or express his honest sentiments,
as I had hoped he might.If what I wrote to that editor was the truth, as
he acknowledged in private, it is time the public knew something of it.I
believe, also, that many of the large number of Osteopaths who have been
discouraged or disgusted, and quit the practice, will approve what I am
writing.There is another class of Osteopathic practitioners who, I
believe, will welcome the truth I have to tell.This consists of the large
number of men and women who are practicing Osteopathy as standing for all
that makes up rational physio-therapy.Speaking of those who have quit the practice of Osteopathy, I will say
that they are known by the Osteopathic faculties to be a large and growing
number.Yet Osteopathic literature sent to prospective students tells of
the small per cent.It may not be
known how many fail, but it is known that many have quit.A journey half across one of our Western States disclosed one Osteopath in
the meat business, one in the real estate business, one clerking in a
store, and two, a blind man and his wife, fairly prosperous Osteopathic
physicians.This was along one short line of railroad, and there is no
reason why it may not be taken as a sample of the percentage of those who
have quit in the entire country.I heard three years ago from a bright young man who graduated with honors,
started out with luxurious office rooms in a flourishing city, and was
pointed to as an example of the prosperity that comes to the Osteopath
from the very start.When I heard from him last he was advance
bill-poster for a cheap show.Another bright classmate was carrying a
chain for surveyors in California.I received an Osteopathic journal recently containing a list of names,
about eight hundred of them, of "mossbacks," as we were politely called.I
say "we," for my name was on the list.The journal said these were the
names of Osteopaths whose addresses were lost and no communication could
be had with them.Just for what, aside
from the annual fee to the American Osteopathic Association, was not
clear.I do know what the silence of a good many of them meant.They have quit,
and do not care to read the abuse that some of the Osteopathic journals
are continually heaping upon those who do not keep their names on the
"Who's Who in Osteopathy" list.There is a large percentage of failures in other professions, and it is
not strange that there should be some in Osteopathy.But when Osteopathic
journals dwell upon the large chances of success and prosperity for those
who choose Osteopathy as a profession, those who might become students
should know the other side.THE OSTEOPATHIC PROPAGANDA.Wonderful Growth Claimed to Prove Merit--Osteopathy is Rational
    Physio-Therapy--Growth is in Exact Proportion to Advertising
    Received--Booklets and Journals for Gratuitous
    Distribution--Osteopathy Languishes or Flourishes by Patent Medicine
    Devices--Circular Letter from Secretary of American Osteopathic
    Association--Boosts by Governors and Senators--The Especial Protege of
    Authors--Mark Twain--Opie Reed--Emerson Hough--Sam Jones--The
    Orificial Surgeon--The M.D.Seeking Job as "Professor"--The Lure of
    "Honored Doctor" with "Big Income"--No Competition.Why has it had such a wonderful growth in
popularity?Why have nearly four thousand men and women, most of them
intelligent and some of them educated, espoused it as a profession to
follow as a life work?These are questions I shall now try to answer.Osteopathic promoters and enthusiasts claim that the wonderful growth and
popularity of Osteopathy prove beyond question its merits as a healing
system.I have already dealt at length with reasons why intelligent people
are so ready to fall victims to new systems of healing.The "perfect
adjustment," "perfect functioning" theory of Osteopathy is especially
attractive to people made ripe for some "drugless healing" system by
causes already mentioned.When Osteopathy is practiced as a combination of
all manipulations and other natural aids to the inherent recuperative
powers of the body, it will appeal to reason in such a way and bring such
good results as to make and keep friends.I am fully persuaded, and I believe the facts when presented will
establish it, that it is the physio-therapy in Osteopathy that wins and
holds the favor of intelligent people.But Osteopathy in its own name,
taught as "a well-rounded system of healing adequate for every emergency,"
has grown and spread largely as a "patent medicine" flourishes, _i.e._,
in exact proportion to the advertising it has received.I would not
presume to make this statement as merely my opinion.The question at issue
is too important to be treated as a matter of opinion.I will present
facts, and let my readers settle the point in their own minds.Every week I get booklets or "sample copies" of journals heralding the
wonderful curative powers of Osteopathy.These are published not as
journals for professional reading, but to be sold to the practitioners by
the hundreds or thousands, to be given to their patients for distribution
by these patients to their friends.The publishers of these "boosters"
say, and present testimonials to prove it, that Osteopaths find their
practice languishes or flourishes just in proportion to the numbers of
these journals and booklets they keep circulating in their communities.Here is a sample testimonial I received some time since on a postal card:

    "Gentlemen: Since using your journals more patients have come to me
    than I could treat, many of them coming from neighboring towns.Quite
    a number have had to go home without being treated, leaving their
    names so that they could be notified later, as I can get to them.Your
    booklets bring them O.The boast is often made that Osteopathy is growing in spite of bitter
opposition and persecution, and is doing it on its merits--doing it
because "Truth is mighty and will prevail."At one time I honestly
believed this to be true, but I have been convinced by highest Osteopathic
authority that it is not true.As some of that proof here is an extract
from a circular letter from the secretary of the American Osteopathic
Association:

    "Now, Doctor, we feel that you have the success of Osteopathy at
    heart, and if you realize the activity and complete organization of
    the American Medical Association and their efforts to curb our
    limitations, and do not become a member of this Association, which
    stands opposed to the efforts of the big monopoly, we must believe
    that you are not familiar with the earnestness of the A. O. A. and its
    efforts.We must work in harmonious accord and with an organized
    purpose._When we rest on our oars the death knell begins to sound._
    Can you not see that unless you co-operate with your
    fellow-practitioners in this national effort you are _sounding your
    own limitations_?"This from the _secretary_ of the American Osteopathic Association, when we
have boasted of superior equipment for intelligent physicians.Incidentally we pause to make excuse for the expressions: "Curbing our
limitations" and "sounding your own limitations."But does the idea that when we quit working as an organized body "_our
death knell begins to sound_," indicate that Osteopathic leaders are
content to trust the future of Osteopathy to its merits?If Osteopathic promoters do not feel that the life of their science
depends on boosting, what did the secretary of the A.O.A.mean when he
said, "Upon the success of these efforts depends the weal or woe of
Osteopathy as an independent system"?If truth always grows under
persecution, how can the American Medical Association kill Osteopathy when
it is so well known by the people?Nearly four thousand Osteopaths are scattered in thirty-six States where
they have some legal recognition, and they are treating thousands of
invalids every day.If they are performing the wonderful cures Osteopathic
journals tell of, why are we told that the welfare of the system depends
upon the noise that is made and the boosting that is done?Has it required advertising to keep people using anesthetics since it was
demonstrated that they would prevent pain?Has it required boosting to keep the people resorting to surgery since the
benefits of modern operations have been proved?Does it look as if Osteopathy has been standing or advancing on its
merits?Does it not seem that Osteopathy, as a complete system, is mostly
a _name_, and "lives, moves, and has its being" in boosting?It seems to
have been about the best boosted fad ever fancied by a foolish people.Osteopathic journals have
published again and again the nice things a number of governors said when
they signed the bills investing Osteopathy with the dignity of State
authority.A certain United States senator from Ohio has won more notoriety as a
champion of Osteopathy than he has lasting fame as a statesman.Osteopathy has been the especial protege of authors.Mark Twain once went
up to Albany and routed an army of medical lobbyists who were there to
resist the passage of a bill favorable to Osteopathy.For this heroic deed
Mark is better known to Osteopaths to-day than even for his renowned
history of Huckleberry Finn.He is in danger of losing his reputation as a
champion of the "under dog in the fight."Lately he has gone on the
warpath again.This time to annihilate poor Mother Eddy and her fond
delusion.Opie Reed is a delightful writer while he sticks to the portrayal of droll
Southern character.Ella Wheeler Wilcox is admirable for the beauty and
boldness with which she portrays the passions and emotions of humanity.But they are both better known to Osteopaths for the bouquets they have
tossed at Osteopathy than for their profound human philosophy that used to
be promulgated by the _Chicago American_.Emerson Hough gave a little free advertising in his "Heart's Desire."There may have been "method in his madness," for that Osteopathic horse
doctoring scene no doubt sold many a book for the author.Sam Jones also helped along with some of his striking originality.Sam
said, "There is as much difference between Osteopathy and massage as
between playing a piano and currying a horse."The idea of comparing the
Osteopath's manipulations of the human body to the skilled touch of the
pianist upon his instrument was especially pleasing to Osteopaths.However, Sam displayed about the same comprehension of his subject that
preachers usually exhibit who try to say nice things about the doctors
when they get their doctoring gratis or at reduced rates.These champions of Osteopathy no doubt mean well.They can be excused on
the ground that they got out of place to aid in the cause of "struggling
truth."But what shall we say of medical men, some of them of reputation
and great influence, who uphold and champion new systems under such
conditions that it is questionable whether they do it from principle or
policy?Osteopathic journals have made much of an article written by a famous
"orificial surgeon."The article appears on the first page of a leading
Osteopath journal, and is headed, "An Expert Opinion on Osteopathy."Among
the many good things he says of the "new science" is this: "The full
benefit of a single sitting can be secured in from three to ten minutes
instead of an hour or more, as required by massage."I shall discuss the
time of an average Osteopathic treatment further on, but I should like to
see how long this brother would hold his practice if he were an Osteopath
and treated from three to ten minutes.He also says that "Osteopathy is so beneficial to cases of insanity that
it seems quite probable that this large class of terrible sufferers may be
almost emancipated from their hell."I shall also say more further on of
what I know of Osteopathy's record as an insanity cure.There is this
significant thing in connection with this noted specialist's boost for
Osteopathy.The journal printing this article comments on it in another
number; tells what a great man the specialist is, and incidentally lets
Osteopaths know that if any of them want to add a knowledge of "orificial
surgery" to their "complete science," this doctor is the man from whom to
get it, as he is the "great and only" in his specialty, and is big and
broad enough to appreciate Osteopathy.The most despicable booster of any new system of therapeutics is the
physician who becomes its champion to get a job as "professor" in one of
its colleges.Of course it is a strong temptation to a medical man who has
never made much of a reputation in his own profession.You may ask, "Have there been many such medical men?"Consult the faculty
rolls of the colleges of these new sciences, and you will be surprised, no
doubt, to find how many put M.D.Some of these were honest converts to the system, perhaps.Some wanted
the honor of being "Professor Doctor," maybe, and some may have been lured
by the same bait that attracts so many students into Osteopathic colleges.That is, the positive assurance of "plenty of easy money" in it.One who has studied the real situation in an effort to learn why
Osteopathy has grown so fast as a profession, can hardly miss the
conclusion that advertising keeps the grist of students pouring into
Osteopathic mills.There is scarcely a corner of the United States that
their seductive literature does not reach.Practitioners in the field are
continually reminded by the schools from which they graduated that their
alma mater looks largely to their solicitations to keep up the supply of
recruits.Their advertising, the tales of wonderful cures and big money made, appeal
to all classes.It seems that none are too scholarly and none too ignorant
to become infatuated with the idea of becoming an "honored doctor" with a
"big income."College professors and preachers have been lured from
comfortable positions to become Osteopaths.Shrewd traveling men, seduced
by the picture of a permanent home, have left the road to become
Osteopathic physicians and be "rich and honored."To me, when a student of Osteopathy, it was
pathetic and almost tragic to observe the crowds of men and women who had
been seduced from spheres of drudging usefulness, such as clerking,
teaching, barbering, etc., to become money-making doctors.In their old
callings they had lost all hope of gratifying ambition for fame and
fortune, but were making an honest living.The rosy pictures of honor,
fame and twenty dollars per day, that the numerous Osteopathic circulars
and journals painted, were not to be withstood.These circulars told them that the fields into which they might go and
reap that $20 per day were unlimited.They said: "There are dozens of
ministers ready to occupy each vacant pulpit, and as many applicants for
each vacancy in the schools.Each hamlet has four or five doctors, where
it can support but one.The legal profession is filled to the starving
point.Young licentiates in the older professions all have to pass through
a starving time.The
picture was a rosy dream of triumphant success!When they had mastered the
great science and become "Doctors of Osteopathy," the world was waiting
with open arms and pocketbooks to receive them.THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OSTEOPATHY.Infallible, Touch-the-Button System that Always Cured--Indefinite
    Movements and Manipulations--Wealth of Undeveloped Scientific
    Facts--Osteopaths Taking M.D.Course--The Standpatter and the
    Drifter--The "Lesionist"--"Bone Setting"--"Inhibiting a
    Center"--Chiropractics--"Finest Anatomists in the World"--How to Cure
    Torticollis, Goitre and Enteric Troubles--A Successful
    Osteopath--Timid Old Maids--Osteopathic Philanthropy.Many of them were men and women
with gray heads, who had found themselves stranded at a time of life when
they should have been able to retire on a competency.They had staked
their little all on this last venture, and what was before them if they
should fail heaven only knew.How eagerly they looked forward to the time
when they should have struggled through the lessons in anatomy, chemistry,
physiology, symptomatology and all the rest, and should be ready to
receive the wonderful principles of Osteopathy they were to apply in
performing the miraculous cures that were to make them wealthy and famous.Need I tell the physician who was a conscientious student of anatomy in
his school days, that there was disappointment when the time came to enter
the class in "theory and practice" of Osteopathy?There had been vague ideas of a systematized, infallible, touch-the-button
system that _always_ cured.Instead, we were instructed in a lot of
indefinite movements and manipulations that somehow left us speculating as
to just how much of it all was done for effect.We had heard so often that Osteopathy was a complete satisfying science
_that did things specifically_!Now it began to dawn upon us that there
was indeed a "wealth of undeveloped scientific facts" in Osteopathy, as
those glittering circulars had said when they thought to attract young men
ambitious for original research.They had said, "Much yet remains to be
discovered."Some of us wondered if the "undeveloped" and "undiscovered"
scientific facts were not the main constituents of the "science."The students expected something exact and tangible, and how eagerly they
grasped at anything in the way of bringing quick results in curing the
sick.If Osteopathy is so complete, why did so many students, after they had
received everything the learned (?)professors had to impart, procure
Juettner's "Modern Physio-Therapy" and Ling's "Manual Therapy" and Rosse's
"Cures Without Drugs" and Kellogg's work on "Hydrotherapy"?They felt that
they needed all they could get.It was customary for the students to begin "treating" after they had been
in school a few months, and medical men will hardly be surprised to know
that they worked with more faith in their healing powers and performed
more wonderful (?)cures in their freshman year than they ever did
afterward.I have in mind a student, one of the brightest I ever met, who read a
cheap book on Osteopathic practice, went into a community where he was
unknown, and practiced as an Osteopathic physician.In a few months he had
made enough money to pay his way through an Osteopathic college, which he
entered professing to believe that Osteopathy would cure all the ills
flesh is heir to, but which he left two years later to take a medical
course.degree, but I notice that it is his M.D.Can students be blamed for getting a little weak in faith when men who
told them that the great principles of Osteopathy were sufficient to cure
_everything_, have been known to backslide so far as to go and take
medical courses themselves?How do you suppose it affects students of an Osteopathic college to read
in a representative journal that the secretary of their school, and the
greatest of all its boosters, calls medical men into his own family when
there is sickness in it?There are many men and women practicing to-day who try to be honest and
conscientious, and by using all the good in Osteopathy, massage, Swedish
movements, hydrotherapy, and all the rest of the adjuncts of
physio-therapy, do a great deal of good.The practitioner who does use
these agencies, however, is denounced by the stand-patters as a "drifter."They say he is not a true Osteopath, but a mongrel who is belittling the
great science.That circular letter from the secretary of the American
Osteopathic Association said that one of the greatest needs of
organization was to preserve Osteopathy in its primal purity as it came
from its founder, A. T. Still.If our medical brethren and the laity could read some of the acrimonious
discussions on the question of using adjuncts, they would certainly be
impressed with the exactness (?)There is one idea of Osteopathy that even the popular mind has grasped,
and that is that it is essentially finding "lesions" and correcting them.Yet the question has been very prominent and pertinent among Osteopaths:
"Are you a lesion Osteopath?"Think of it, gentlemen, asking an Osteopath
if he is a "lesionist"!Yet there are plenty of Osteopaths who are stupid
enough (or honest enough) not to be able to find bones "subluxed" every
time they look at a patient.Practitioners who really want to do their
patrons good will use adjuncts even if they are denounced by the
stand-patters.I believe every conscientious Osteopath must sometimes feel that it is
safer to use rational remedies than to rely on "bone setting," or
"inhibiting a center," but for the grafter it is not so spectacular and
involves more hard work.The stand-patters of the American Osteopathic Association have not
eliminated all trouble when they get Osteopaths to stick to the "bone
setting, inhibiting" idea.The chiropractic man threatens to steal their
thunder here.The Chiropractor has found that when it comes to using
mysterious maneuvers and manipulations as bases for mind cure, one thing
is about as good as another, except that the more mysterious a thing
looks the better it works.So the Chiropractor simply gives his healing
"thrusts" or his wonderful "adjustments," touches the buttons along the
spine as it were, when--presto!disease has flown before his healing touch
and blessed health has come to reign instead!The Osteopath denounces the Chiropractor as a brazen fraud who has stolen
all that is good in Chiropractics (if there _is_ anything good) from
Osteopathy.But Chiropractics follows so closely what the "old liner"
calls the true theory of Osteopathy that, between him and the drifter who
gives an hour of crude massage, or uses the forbidden accessories, the
true Osteopath has a hard time maintaining the dignity (?)of Osteopathy
and keeping its practitioners from drifting.Some of the most ardent supporters of true Osteopathy I have ever known
have drifted entirely away from it.After practicing two or three years,
abusing medicine and medical men all the time, and proclaiming to the
people continually that they had in Osteopathy all that a sick world could
ever need, it is suddenly learned that the "Osteopath is gone."He has
"silently folded his tent and stolen away," and where has he gone?He has
gone to a medical college to study that same medicine he has so
industriously abused while he was gathering in the shekels as an
Osteopath.Going to learn and practice the science he has so persistently
denounced as a fraud and a curse to humanity.The intelligent, conscientious Osteopath who dares to brave the scorn of
the stand-patter and use all the legitimate adjuncts of Osteopathy found
in physio-therapy, may do a great deal of good as a physician.I have
found many physicians willing to acknowledge this, and even recommend the
services of such an Osteopath when physio-therapy was indicated.When a physician, however, meets a fellow who claims to have in his
Osteopathy a wonderful system, complete and all-sufficient to cope with
any and all diseases, and that his system is founded on a knowledge of the
relation and function of the various parts and organs of the body such as
no other school of therapeutics has ever been able to discover, then he
knows that he has met a man of the same mental and moral calibre as the
shyster in his own school.He knows he has met a fellow who is exploiting
a thing, that may be good in its way and place, as a graft.And he knows
that this grafter gets his wonderful cures largely as any other quack gets
his; the primary effects of his "scientific manipulations" are on the
minds of those treated.The intelligent physician knows that the Osteopath got his boastedly
superior knowledge of anatomy mostly from the same text-books and same
class of cadavers that other physicians had to master if they graduated
from a reputable school.All that talk we have heard so much about the
Osteopaths being the "finest anatomists in the world" sounds plausible,
and is believed by the laity generally.The quotation I gave above has been much used in Osteopathic literature
as coming from an eminent medical man.What foundation is there for such a
belief?The Osteopath _may_ be a good anatomist.He has about the same
opportunities to learn anatomy the medical student has.If he is a good
and conscientious student he may consider his anatomy of more importance
than does the medical student who is not expecting to do much surgery.If
he is a natural shyster and shirk he can get through a course in
Osteopathy and get his diploma, and this diploma may be about the only
proof he could ever give that he is a "superior anatomist."Great stress has always been laid by Osteopaths upon the amount of study
and research done by their students on the cadaver.I want to give you
some specimens of the learning of the man (an M.D.)who presided over the
dissecting-room when I pursued my "profound research" on the "lateral
half."This great man, whose superior knowledge of anatomy, I presume,
induced by the wise management of the college to employ him as a
demonstrator, in an article written for the organ of the school expresses
himself thus:

    "It is needless to say that the first impression of an M. D. would not
    be favorable to Osteopathy, because he has spent years fixing in his
    mind that if you had a bad case of torticollis not to touch it, but
    give a man morphine or something of the same character with an
    external blister or hot application and in a week or ten days he would
    be all right.In the meanwhile watch the patient's general health,
    relieve the induced constipation by suitable means and rearrange what
    he has disarranged in his treatment.On the other hand, let the
    Osteopath get hold of this patient, and with his _vast_ and we might
    say _perfect_ knowledge of anatomy, he at once, with no other tools
    than his hands, inhibits the nerves supplying the affected parts, and
    in five minutes the patient can freely move his head and shoulders,
    entirely relieved from pain.Would
    he not feel like wiping off the earth with all the Osteopaths?Doctor,
    with your medical education a course in Osteopathy would teach you
    that it is not necessary to subject your patients to myxedema by
    removing the thyroid gland to cure goitre.You would not have to lie
    awake nights studying means to stop one of those troublesome bowel
    complaints in children, nor to insist upon the enforced diet in
    chronic diarrhea, and a thousand other things which are purely
    physiological and are not done by any magical presto change, but by
    methods which are perfectly rational if you will only listen long
    enough to have them explained to you.I will agree that at first
    impression all methods look alike to the medical man, but when
    explained by an intelligent teacher they will bring their just
    reward."Gentlemen of the medical profession, study the above
carefully--punctuation, composition, profound wisdom and all.Surely you
did not read it when it was given to the world a few years ago, or you
would all have been converted to Osteopathy then, and the medical
profession left desolate.We have heard many bad things of medical men,
but never (until we learned it from one who was big-brained enough to
accept Osteopathy when its great truths dawned upon him) did we know that
you are so dull of intellect that it takes you "years to fix in your minds
that if you had a bad case of torticollis not to touch it but to give a
man morphine."And how pleased Osteopaths are to learn from this scholar that the
Osteopath can "take hold" of a case of torticollis, "and with his vast and
we might say perfect knowledge of anatomy" inhibit the nerves and have the
man cured in five minutes.We were glad to learn this great truth from
this learned ex-M.D., as we never should have known, otherwise, that
Osteopathy is so potent.I have had cases of torticollis in my practice, and thought I had done
well if after a half hour of hard work massaging contracted muscles I had
benefited the case.And note the relevancy of these questions, "Would not the medical man be
angry?Would he not feel like wiping off the earth all the Osteopaths?"Gentlemen, can you explain your ex-brother's meaning here?Surely you are
not all so hard-hearted that you would be angry because a poor wry-necked
fellow had been cured in five minutes.To be serious, I ask you to think of "the finest anatomists in the world"
doing their "original research" work in the dissecting-room under the
direction of a man of the scholarly attainments indicated by the
composition and thought of the above article.Do you see now how
Osteopaths get a "vast and perfect knowledge of anatomy"?Do you suppose that the law of "the survival of the fittest" determines
who continues in the practice of Osteopathy and succeeds?Is it true worth
and scholarly ability that get a big reputation of success among medical
men?I know, and many medical men know from competition with him (if they
would admit that such a fellow may be a competitor), that the ignoramus
who as a physician is the product of a diploma mill often has a bigger
reputation and performs more wonderful cures (?)than the educated
Osteopath who really mastered the prescribed course but is too
conscientious to assume responsibility for human life when he is not sure
that he can do all that might be done to save life.I once met an Osteopath whose literary attainments had never reached the
rudiments of an education.He had never really comprehended a single
lesson of his entire course.He told me that he was then on a vacation to
get much-needed rest.He had such a large practice that the physical labor
of it was wearing him out.I knew of this fellow's qualifications, but I
thought he might be one of those happy mortals who have the faculty of
"doing things," even if they cannot learn the theory.To learn the secret
of this fellow's success, if I could, I let him treat me.I had some
contracted muscles that were irritating nerves and holding joints in tense
condition, a typical case, if there are any, for an Osteopathic treatment.I expected him to do some of that
"expert Osteopathic diagnosing" that you have heard of, but he began in an
aimless desultory way, worked almost an hour, found nothing specific, did
nothing but give me a poor unsystematic massage.He was giving me a
"popular treatment."In many towns people have come to estimate the value of an Osteopathic
treatment by its duration.People used to say to me, "You don't treat as
long as Dr.----, who was here before you," and say it in a way indicating
that they were hardly satisfied they had gotten their money's worth.Some
of them would say: "He treated me an hour for seventy-five cents."Does it
seem funny to talk of adjusting lesions on one person for an hour at a
time, three times a week?My picture of incompetency and apparent success of incompetents, is not
overdrawn.The other day I had a marked copy of a local paper from a town
in California.It was a flattering write-up of an old classmate.The
doctor's automobile was mentioned, and he had marked with a cross a fine
auto shown in a picture of the city garage.This fellow had been
considered by all the Simple Simon of the class, inferior in almost every
attribute of true manliness, yet now he flourishes as one of those of our
class to whose success the school can "point with pride."It is interesting to read the long list of "changes of location" among
Osteopaths, yet between the lines there is a sad story that may be read.First, "Doctor Blank has located
in Philadelphia, with twenty-five patients for the first month and rapidly
growing practice."A year or so after another item tells that "Doctor
Blank has located in San Francisco with bright prospects."Then "Doctor
Blank has returned to Missouri on account of his wife's health, and
located in ----, where he has our best wishes for success."Their career
reminds us of Goldsmith's lines:

  "As the hare whom horn and hounds pursue
  Pants to the place from whence at first he flew."There has been many a tragic scene enacted upon the Osteopathic stage, but
the curtain has not been raised for the public to behold them.How many
timid old maids, after saving a few hundred dollars from wages received
for teaching school, have been persuaded that they could learn Osteopathy
while their shattered nerves were repaired and they were made young and
beautiful once more by a course of treatment in the clinics of the school.Then they would be ready to go out to occupy a place of dignity and honor,
and treat ten to thirty patients per month at twenty-five dollars per
patient.Gentlemen of the medical profession, from what you know of the aggressive
spirit that it takes to succeed in professional life to-day (to say
nothing of the physical strength required in the practice of Osteopathy),
what per cent.of these timid old maids do you suppose have "panted to the
place from whence at first they flew," after leaving their pitiful little
savings with the benefactors of humanity who were devoting their splendid
talents to the cause of Osteopathy?If any one doubts that some Osteopathic schools are conducted from other
than philanthropic motives, let him read what the _Osteopathic Physician_
said of a new school founded in California.Of all the fraud, bare-faced
shystering, and flagrant rascality ever exposed in any profession, the
circumstances of the founding of this school, as depicted by the editor of
the _Osteopathic Physician_, furnishes the most disgusting instance.Men
to whom we had clung when the anchor of our faith in Osteopathy seemed
about to drag were held up before us as sneaking, cringing, incompetent
rascals, whose motives in founding the school were commercial in the worst
sense.And how do you suppose Osteopaths out in the field of practice feel
when they receive catalogues from the leading colleges that teach their
system, and these catalogues tell of the superior education the colleges
are equipped to give, and among the pictures of learned members of the
faculty they recognize the faces of old schoolmates, with glasses, pointed
beards and white ties, silk hats maybe, but the same old classmate
of--sometimes not ordinary ability.I spoke a moment ago of old maids being induced to believe that they would
be made over in the clinics of an Osteopathic college.An Osteopathic journal before me says: "If it were generally
known that Osteopathy has a wonderfully rejuvenating effect upon fading
beauty, Osteopathic physicians would be overworked as beauty doctors."Another journal says: "If the aged could know how many years might be
added to their lives by Osteopathy, they would not hesitate to avail
themselves of treatment."A leading D. O. discusses consumption as treated Osteopathically, and
closes his discussion with the statement in big letters: "CONSUMPTION CAN
BE CURED."Another Osteopathic doctor says the curse that was placed upon Mother Eve
in connection with the propagation of the race has been removed by
Osteopathy, and childbirth "positively painless" is a consummated fact.The insane emancipated from
their hell!Asthma
cured by moving a bone!What more in therapeutics is left to be desired?CHAPTER X.

OSTEOPATHY AS RELATED TO SOME OTHER FAKES.Sure Shot Rheumatism Cure--Regular Practitioner's
    Discomfiture--Medicines Alone Failed to Cure Rheumatism--Osteopathy
    Relieves Rheumatic and Neuralgic Pains--"Move Things"--"Pop" Stray
    Cervical Vertebrae--Find Something Wrong and Put it Right--Terrible
    Neck-Wrenching, Bone-Twisting Ordeal.A discussion of graft in connection with doctoring would not be complete
if nothing were said about the traveling medicine faker.Every summer our
towns are visited by smooth-tongued frauds who give free shows on the
streets.They harangue the people by the hour with borrowed spiels, full
of big medical terms, and usually full of abuse of regular practitioners,
which local physicians must note with humiliation is too often received by
people without resentment and often with applause.Only last summer I was standing by while one of these grafters was making
his spiel, and gathering dollars by the pocketful for a "sure shot"
rheumatism cure.His was a _sure_ cure, doubly guaranteed; no cure, money
all refunded (if you could get it).A physician standing near laughed
rather a mirthless laugh, and remarked that Barnum was right when he said,
"The American people like to be humbugged."When the medical man left, a
man who had just become the happy possessor of enough of the wonderful
herb to make a quart of the rheumatism router, remarked: "He couldn't be a
worse humbug than that old duffer.He doctored me for six weeks, and told
me all the time that his medicine would cure me in a few days.I got worse
all the time until I went to Dr.----, who told me to use a sack of hot
bran mash on my back, and I was able to get around in two days."In this man's remarks there is an explanation of the reason the crowd
laughed when they heard the quack abusing the regular practitioner, and of
the reason the people handed their hard-earned dollars to the grafter at
the rate of forty in ten minutes, by actual count.If all doctors were
honest and told the people what all authorities have agreed upon about
rheumatism, _i.e._, that internal medication does it little good, and the
main reliance must be on external application, traveling and patent
medicine fakers who make a specialty of rheumatism cure would be "put out
of business," and there would be eliminated one source of much loss of
faith in medicine.I learned by experience as an Osteopath that many people lose faith in
medicine and in the honesty of physicians because of the failure of
medicine to cure rheumatism where the physician had promised a cure.Patients afflicted with other diseases get well anyway, or the sexton puts
them where they cannot tell people of the physician's failure to cure
them.The rheumatic patient lives on, and talks on of "Doc's" failure to
stop his rheumatic pains.All doctors know that rheumatism is the
universal disease of our fickle climate.If it were not for rheumatic
pains, and neuralgic pains that often come from nerves irritated by
contracted muscles, the Osteopath in the average country town would get
more lonesome than he does.People who are otherwise skeptical concerning
the merits of Osteopathy will admit that it seems rational treatment for
rheumatism.Yet this is a disease that Osteopathy of the specific-adjustment,
bone-setting, nerve-inhibiting brand has little beneficial effect upon.All the Osteopathic treatments I ever gave or saw given in cases of
rheumatism that really did any good, were long, laborious massages.The
medical man who as "professor" in an Osteopathic college said, "When the
Osteopath with his _vast_ knowledge of anatomy gets hold of a case of
torticollis he inhibits the nerves and cures it in five minutes," was
talking driveling rot.I have seen some of the best Osteopaths treat wry-neck, and the work they
did was to knead and stretch and pull, which by starting circulation and
working out soreness, gradually relieved the patient.A hot application,
by expanding tissues and stimulating circulation, would have had the same
effect, perhaps more slowly manifested.To call any Osteopathic treatment massage is always resented as an insult
by the guardians of the science.What is the Osteopath doing, who rolls
and twists and pulls and kneads for a full hour, if he isn't giving a
massage treatment?Of course, it sounds more dignified, and perhaps helps
to "preserve the purity of Osteopathy as a separate system," to call it
"reducing subluxations," "correcting lesions," "inhibiting and
stimulating" nerves.The treatment also acts better as a placebo to call
it by these names.As students we were taught that all Osteopathic movements were primarily
to adjust something.Some of us worried for fear we wouldn't know when the
adjusting was complete.We were told that all the movements we were taught
to make were potent to "move things," so we worried again for fear we
might move something in the wrong direction.We were assured, however,
that since the tendency was always toward the normal, all we had to do was
to agitate, stir things up a bit, and the thing out of place would find
its place.We were told that when in the midst of our "agitation" we heard something
"pop," we could be sure the thing out of place had gone back.When a
student had so mastered the great bone-setting science as to be able to
"pop" stray cervical vertebrae he was looked upon with envy by the fellows
who had not joined the association for protection against suits for
malpractice, and did not know just how much of an owl they could make of a
man and not break his neck.The fellow who lacked clairvoyant powers to locate straying things, and
could not always find the "missing link" of the spine, could go through
the prescribed motions just the same.If he could do it with sufficient
facial contortions to indicate supreme physical exertion, and at the same
time preserve the look of serious gravity and professional importance of a
quack medical doctor giving _particular_ directions for the dosing of the
placebo he is leaving, he might manage to make a sound vertebra "pop."This, with his big show of doing something, has its effect on the
patient's mind anyway.We were taught that Osteopathy was applied common sense, that it was all
reasonable and rational, and simply meant "finding something wrong and
putting it right."Some of us thought it only fair to tell our patients
what we were trying to do, and what we did it for.There is where we made
our big mistake.To say we were relaxing muscles, or trying to lift and
tone up a rickety chest wall, or straighten a warped spine, was altogether
too simple.It was like telling a man that you were going to give him a
dose of oil for the bellyache when he wanted an operation for
appendicitis.It was too common, and some would go to an Osteopath who
could find vertebra and ribs and hips displaced, something that would make
the community "sit up and take notice."If one has to be sick, why not
have something worth while?Where Osteopathy has always been so administered that people have the idea
that it means to find things out of place and put them back, it is a
gentleman's job, professional, scientific and genteel.Men have been known
to give twenty to forty treatments a day at two dollars per treatment.In
many communities, however, the adjustment idea has so degenerated that to
give an Osteopathic treatment is no job for a high collar on a hot day.To
strip a hard-muscled, two-hundred-pound laborer down to a
perspiration-soaked and scented undershirt, and manipulate him for an hour
while he has every one of his five hundred work-hardened muscles rigidly
set to protect himself from the terrible neck-wrenching, bone-twisting
ordeal he has been told an Osteopathic treatment would subject him to--I
say when you have tried that sort of a thing for an hour you will conclude
that an Osteopathic treatment is no job for a kid-gloved dandy nor for a
lily-fingered lady, as it has been so glowingly pictured.I know the brethren will say that true Osteopathy does not give an hour's
shotgun treatment, but finds the lesion, corrects it, collects its two
dollars, and quits until "day after to-morrow," when it "corrects" and
_collects_ again as long as there is anything to co--llect!I practiced for three years in a town where people made their first
acquaintance with Osteopathy through the treatments of a man who
afterwards held the position of demonstrator of Osteopathic "movements"
and "manipulations" in one of the largest and boastedly superior schools
of Osteopathy.The people certainly should have received correct ideas of
Osteopathy from him.He was followed in the town by a bright young fellow
from "Pap's" school, where the genuine "lesion," blown-in-the-bottle brand
of Osteopathy has always been taught.This fellow was such an excellent
Osteopath that he made enough money in two years to enable him to quit
Osteopathy forever.This he did, using the money he had gathered as an
Osteopath to take him through a medical college.I followed these two shining lights who I supposed had established
Osteopathy on a correct basis.I started in to give specific treatments as
I had been taught to do; that is, to hunt for the lesion, correct it if I
found it, and quit, even if I had not been more than fifteen or twenty
minutes at it.I found that in many cases my patients were not satisfied.I did not know just what was the matter at first, and lost some desirable
patients (lost their patronage, I mean--they were not in much danger of
dying when they came to me).I was soon enlightened, however, by some more
outspoken than the rest.They said I did not "treat as long as that other
doctor," and when I had done what I thought was indicated at times a
patient would say, "You didn't give me that neck-twisting movement," or
that "leg-pulling treatment."No matter what I thought was indicated, I
had to give all the movements each time that had ever been given before.A physician who has had to dose out something he knew would do no good,
just to satisfy the patient and keep him from sending for another doctor
who he feared might give something worse, can appreciate the violence done
a fellow's conscience as he administers those wonderfully curative
movements.He cannot, however, appreciate the emotions that come from the
strenuous exertion over a sweaty body in a close room on a July day.Incidentally, this difference in the physical exertion necessary to get
the same results has determined a good many to quit Osteopathy and take up
medicine.A young man who had almost completed a course in Osteopathy told
me he was going to study medicine when he had finished Osteopathy, as he
had found that giving "treatments was too d----d hard work."TAPEWORMS AND GALLSTONES.Plug-hatted Faker--Frequency of Tapeworms--Some Tricks Exposed--How
    the Defunct Worm was Passed--Rubber Near-Worm--New Gallstone
    Cure--Relation to Osteopathy--Perfect, Self-Oiling, "Autotherapeutic"
    Machine--Touch the Button--The Truth About the Consumption and
    Insanity Cures.There is another trump card the traveling medical grafter plays, which
wins about as well as the guaranteed rheumatism cure, namely, the tapeworm
fraud.Last summer I heard a plug-hatted faker delivering a lecture to a
street crowd, in which he said that every mother's son or daughter of them
who didn't have the rosy cheek, the sparkling eye and buoyancy of youth
might be sure that a tapeworm of monstrous size was, "like a worm in the
bud," feeding on their "damask cheeks."To prove his assertion and lend
terror to his tale, he held aloft a glass jar containing one of the
monsters that had been driven from its feast on the vitals of its victim
by his never-failing remedy.The person, "saved from a living death,"
stood at the "doctor's" side to corroborate the story, while his
voluptuous wife was kept busy handing out the magical remedy and "pursing
the ducats" given in return.How this one was secured I do not know; but
intelligent people ought to know that cases of tapeworm are not so common
that eight people out of every ten have one, as this grafter positively
asserted.An acquaintance once traveled with one of these tapeworm specialists to
furnish the song and dance performances that are so attractive to the
class of people who furnish the ready victims for grafters.The "specialist" would pick out an emaciated,
credulous individual from his crowd, and tell him that he bore the
unmistakable marks of being the prey of a terrible tapeworm.If he
couldn't sell him a bottle of his worm eradicator, he would give him a
bottle, telling him to take it according to directions and report to him
at his hotel or tent the next day.The man would report that no dead or
dying worm had been sighted.The man was told that if he had taken the medicine as directed the
worm was dead beyond a doubt, but sometimes the "fangs" were fastened so
firmly to the walls of the intestines, in their death agony, that they
would not come away until he had injected a certain preparation that
_always_ "produced the goods."The man was taken into a darkened room for privacy (?), the injection
given, and the defunct worm always came away.At least a worm was always
found in the evacuated material, and how was the deluded one to know that
it was in the vessel or matter injected?Of course, the patient felt
wondrous relief, and was glad to stand up that night and testify that Dr.Grafter was an angel of mercy sent to deliver him from the awful fate of
living where "the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched."I was told recently of a new tapeworm graft that makes the old one look
crude and unscientific.This one actually brings a tapeworm from the
intestines in _every_ case, whether the person had one before the magic
remedy was given or not.The graft is to have a near-worm manufactured of
delicate rubber and compressed into a capsule.The patient swallows the
capsule supposed to contain the worm destroyer.The rubber worm is not
digested, and a strong physic soon produces it, to the great relief of the
"patient" and the greater glory and profit of the shyster.What a
wonderful age of invention and scientific discoveries!Another journal tells of a new gallstone cure that never fails to cause
the stones to be passed even if they are big as walnuts.The graft in this
is that the medicine consists of paraffine dissolved in  oil.The
paraffine does not digest, but collects in  balls, which are passed
by handfuls and are excellent imitations of the real things.How about tapeworms, gallstones and Osteopathy, do you ask?We heard about tapeworms and gallstones when we were in Osteopathic
college.The one thing that was ground into us early and thoroughly was that
Osteopathy was a complete system.No matter what any other system had
done, we were to remember that Osteopathy could do that thing more surely
and more scientifically.Students soon learned that they were never to ask, "_Can_ we treat this?"That indicated skepticism, which was intolerable in the atmosphere of
optimistic faith that surrounded the freshman and sophomore classes
especially.The question was to be put, "_How_ do we treat this?"In the
treatment of worms the question was, "How do we treat worms?"Had not nature made a machine, perfect in all its parts,
self-oiling, "autotherapeutic," and all that?And would nature allow it to
choke up or slip a cog just because a little thing like a worm got tangled
in its gearing?Nature knew that worms would intrude, and had
provided her own vermifuge.The cause of worms is insufficient bile, and
behold, all the Osteopath had to do when he wished to serve notice on the
aforesaid worms to vacate the premises was to touch the button controlling
the stop-cock to the bile-duct, and they left.It was so simple and easy
we wondered how the world could have been so long finding it out.That was the proposition on which we were to
stand.If anything had to be removed, or brought back, or put in place,
all that was necessary was to open the floodgates, release the pent-up
forces of nature, and the thing was done!What a happy condition, to have _perfect_ faith!I remember a report came
to our school of an Osteopathic physician who read a paper before a
convention of his brethren, in which he recorded marvelous cures performed
in cases of tuberculosis.The paper was startling, even revolutionary, yet
it was not too much for our faith.We were almost indignant at some who
ventured to suggest that curing consumption by manipulation might be
claiming too much.These wonderful cures were performed in a town which I
afterward visited.I could find no one who knew of a single case that had
been cured.There were those who knew of cases of tuberculosis he had
treated, that had gone as most other bad cases of that disease go.It is one of the main cases, from
all that I can learn, upon which all the bold claims of Osteopathy as an
insanity cure are based.I remember an article under scare headlines big
enough for a bloody murder, flared out in the local paper.It was yet more
wonderfully heralded in the papers at the county seat.The metropolitan
dailies caught up the echo, which reverberated through Canada and was
finally heard across the seas!Osteopathic journals took it up and made
much of it.Those in school read it with eager satisfaction, and plunged
into their studies with fiercer enthusiasm.Many who had been "almost
persuaded" were induced by it to "cross the Rubicon," and take up the
study of this wonderful new science that could take a raving maniac,
condemned to a mad house by medical men, and with a few scientific twists
of the neck cause raging insanity to give place to gentle sleep that
should wake in sanity and health.Was it any wonder that students flocked to schools that professed to teach
how common plodding mortals could work such miracles?Was it strange that
anxious friends brought dear ones, over whom the black cloud of insanity
cast its shadows, hundreds of miles to be treated by this man?Or to the
Osteopathic colleges, from which, in all cases of which I ever knew, they
returned sadly disappointed?The report of that wonderful cure caused many intelligent laymen (and even
Dr.Pratt) to indulge a hope that insanity might be only a disturbance of
the blood supply to the brain caused by pressure from distorted "neck
bones," or other lesions, and that Osteopaths were to empty our
overcrowded madhouses.I
was told by an intimate friend of this great Osteopath that all these
startling reports we had supposed were published as news the papers were
glad to get because of their important truths, were but shrewd
advertising.I afterward talked with the man, and his friends who were at
the bedside when the miracle was performed, and while they believed that
there had been good done by the treatment, it was all so tame and
commonplace at home compared with its fame abroad that I have wondered
ever since if anything much was really done after all.Honesty--Plain Dealing--Education.I could multiply incidents, but it would grow
monotonous.I believe I have told enough that is disgusting to the
intelligent laity and medical men, and enough that is humiliating to the
capable, honest Osteopath, who practices his "new science" as standing for
all that is good in physio-therapy.I hope I have told, or recalled, something that will help physicians to
see that the way to clear up the turbidity existing in therapeutics to-day
is by open, honest dealing with the laity, and by a campaign of education
that shall impart to them enough of the scientific principles of medicine
so that they may know when they are being imposed upon by quacks and
grafters.I am encouraged to believe I am on the right track.After I had
written this booklet I read, in a report of the convention of the American
Medical Association held in Chicago, that one of the leaders of the
Association told his brethren that the most important work before them as
physicians was to conduct a campaign of education for the masses.It must
be done not only to protect the people, but as well to protect the honest
physician.There is another fact that faces the medical profession, and I believe I
have called attention to conditions that prove it.That is, that the hope
of the profession of "doctoring" being placed on an honest rational basis
lies in a broader and more thorough education of the physician.A broad,
liberal general education to begin with, then all that can be known about
medicine and surgery.Then all that there is in
physio-therapy, under whatsoever name, that promises to aid in curing or
preventing disease.If this humble production aids but a little in any of this great work,
then my object in writing will have been achieved.Now it is well, when we have
strong moral or poetical feeling manifested in painting, to mark this as
the best part of the work; but it is not well to consider as a thing of
small account, the painter's language in which that feeling is conveyed,
for if that language be not good and lovely, the man may indeed be a
just moralist or a great poet, but he is not a _painter_, and it was
wrong of him to paint.He had much better put his morality into sermons,
and his poetry into verse, than into a language of which he was not
master.And this mastery of the language is that of which we should be
cognizant by a glance of the eye; and if that be not found, it is wasted
time to look farther: the man has mistaken his vocation, and his
expression of himself will be cramped by his awkward efforts to do what
he was not fit to do.On the other hand, if the man be a painter indeed,
and have the gift of colors and lines, what is in him will come from his
hand freely and faithfully; and the language itself is so difficult and
so vast, that the mere possession of it argues the man is great, and
that his works are worth reading.So that I have never yet seen the case
in which this true artistical excellence, visible by the eye-glance, was
not the index of some true expressional worth in the work.Neither have
I ever seen a good expressional work without high artistical merit: and
that this is ever denied is only owing to the narrow view which men are
apt to take both of expression and of art; a narrowness consequent on
their own especial practice and habits of thought.A man long trained to
love the monk's visions of Fra Angelico, turns in proud and ineffable
disgust from the first work of Rubens which he encounters on his return
across the Alps.He has forgotten,
that while Angelico prayed and wept in his _olive shade_, there was
different work doing in the dank fields of Flanders;--wild seas to be
banked out; endless canals to be dug, and boundless marshes to be
drained; hard ploughing and harrowing of the frosty clay; careful
breeding of stout horses and fat cattle; close setting of brick walls
against cold winds and snow; much hardening of hands and gross
stoutening of bodies in all this; gross jovialities of harvest homes and
Christmas feasts, which were to be the reward of it; rough affections,
and sluggish imagination; fleshy, substantial, ironshod humanities, but
humanities still; humanities which God had his eye upon, and which won,
perhaps, here and there, as much favor in his sight as the wasted
aspects of the whispering monks of Florence (Heaven forbid it should not
be so, since the most of us cannot be monks, but must be ploughmen and
reapers still).And are we to suppose there is no nobility in Rubens'
masculine and universal sympathy with all this, and with his large human
rendering of it, Gentleman though he was, by birth, and feeling, and
education, and place; and, when he chose, lordly in conception also?He
had his faults, perhaps great and lamentable faults, though more those
of his time and his country than his own; he has neither cloister
breeding nor boudoir breeding, and is very unfit to paint either in
missals or annuals; but he has an open sky and wide-world breeding in
him, that we may not be offended with, fit alike for king's court,
knight's camp, or peasant's cottage.On the other hand, a man trained
here in England, in our Sir Joshua school, will not and cannot allow
that there is any art at all in the technical work of Angelico.But he
is just as wrong as the other.Fra Angelico is as true a master of the
art necessary to his purposes, as Rubens was of that necessary for his.We have been taught in England to think there can be no virtue but in a
loaded brush and rapid hand; but if we can shake our common sense free
of such teaching, we shall understand that there is art also in the
delicate point and in the hand which trembles as it moves; not because
it is more liable to err, but because there is more danger in its error,
and more at stake upon its precision.The art of Angelico, both as a
colorist and a draughtsman, is consummate; so perfect and beautiful,
that his work may be recognised at any distance by the rainbow-play and
brilliancy of it: However closely it may be surrounded by other works of
the same school, glowing with enamel and gold, Angelico's may be told
from them at a glance, like so many huge pieces of opal lying among
common marbles.So again with Giotto; the Arena chapel is not only the
most perfect expressional work, it is the prettiest piece of wall
decoration and fair color, in North Italy.Now there is a correspondence of the same kind between the technical and
expressional parts of architecture;--not a true or entire
correspondence, so that when the expression is best, the building must
be also best; but so much of correspondence as that good building is
necessary to good expression, comes before it, and is to be primarily
looked for: and the more, because the manner of building is capable of
being determinately estimated and classed; but the expressional
character not so: we can at once determine the true value of technical
qualities, we can only approximate to the value of expressional
qualities: and besides this, the looking for the technical qualities
first will enable us to cast a large quantity of rubbish aside at once,
and so to narrow the difficult field of inquiry into expression: we
shall get rid of Chinese pagodas and Indian temples, and Renaissance
Palladianisms, and Alhambra stucco and filigree, in one great rubbish
heap; and shall not need to trouble ourselves about their expression, or
anything else concerning them.Then taking the buildings which have been
rightly put together, and which show common sense in their structure, we
may look for their farther and higher excellences; but on those which
are absurd in their first steps we need waste no time.I could have wished, before writing this chapter, to have given more
study to the difficult subject of the strength of shafts of different
materials and structure; but I cannot enter into every inquiry which
general criticism might suggest, and this I believe to be one which
would have occupied the reader with less profit than many others: all
that is necessary for him to note is, that the great increase of
strength gained by a tubular form in iron shafts, of given solid
contents, is no contradiction to the general principle stated in the
text, that the strength of materials is most available when they are
most concentrated.The strength of the tube is owing to certain
properties of the arch formed by its sides, not to the dispersion of its
materials: and the principle is altogether inapplicable to stone shafts.No one would think of building a pillar of a succession of sandstone
rings; however strong it might be, it would be still stronger filled up,
and the substitution of such a pillar for a solid one of the same
contents would lose too much space; for a stone pillar, even when solid,
must be quite as thick as is either graceful or convenient, and in
modern churches is often too thick as it is, hindering sight of the
preacher, and checking the sound of his voice.Some three months ago, and long after the writing of this passage, I met
accidentally with Mr.If I had cared about the reputation of originality, I should have
been annoyed--and was so, at first, on finding Mr.Garbett's
illustrations of the subject exactly the same as mine, even to the
choice of the elephant's foot for the parallel of the Doric pillar: I
even thought of omitting, or rewriting, great part of the chapter, but
determined at last to let it stand.I am striving to speak plain truths
on many simple and trite subjects, and I hope, therefore, that much of
what I say has been said before, and am quite willing to give up all
claim to originality in any reasoning or assertion whatsoever, if any
one cares to dispute it.I desire the reader to accept what I say, not
as mine, but as the truth, which may be all the world's, if they look
for it.Frank Howard promised at some
discussion respecting the "Seven Lamps," reported in the "Builder," to
pluck all my borrowed feathers off me; but I did not see the end of the
discussion, and do not know to this day how many feathers I have left:
at all events the elephant's foot must belong to Mr.Garbett, though,
strictly speaking, neither he nor I can be quite justified in using it,
for an elephant in reality stands on tiptoe; and this is by no means the
expression of a Doric shaft.As, however, I have been obliged to speak
of this treatise of Mr.Garbett's, and desire also to recommend it as of
much interest and utility in its statements of fact, it is impossible
for me to pass altogether without notice, as if unanswerable, several
passages in which the writer has objected to views stated in the "Seven
Lamps."I should at any rate have noticed the passage quoted above,
(Chap.30th,) which runs counter to the spirit of all I have ever
written, though without referring to me; but the references to the
"Seven Lamps" I should not have answered, unless I had desired,
generally, to recommend the book, and partly also, because they may
serve as examples of the kind of animadversion which the "Seven Lamps"
had to sustain from architects, very generally; which examples being
once answered, there will be little occasion for my referring in future
to other criticisms of the kind.The first reference to the "Seven Lamps" is in the second page, where
Mr.Garbett asks a question, "Why are not convenience and stability
enough to constitute a fine building?"--which I should have answered
shortly by asking another, "Why we have been made men, and not bees nor
termites:" but Mr.Garbett has given a very pretty, though partial,
answer to it himself, in his 4th to 9th pages,--an answer which I
heartily beg the reader to consider.But, in page 12, it is made a grave
charge against me, that I use the words beauty and ornament
interchangeably.I do so, and ever shall; and so, I believe, one day,
will Mr.Garbett himself; but not while he continues to head his pages
thus:--"Beauty not dependent on ornament, _or superfluous_ features."What right has he to assume that ornament, rightly so called, ever was,
or can be, superfluous?I have said before, and repeatedly in other
places, that the most beautiful things are the most useless; I never
said superfluous.I said useless in the well-understood and usual sense,
as meaning, inapplicable to the service of the body.Thus I called
peacocks and lilies useless; meaning, that roast peacock was unwholesome
(taking Juvenal's word for it), and that dried lilies made bad hay: but
I do not think peacocks superfluous birds, nor that the world could get
on well without its lilies.Or, to look closer, I suppose the peacock's
blue eyes to be very useless to him; not dangerous indeed, as to their
first master, but of small service, yet I do not think there is a
superfluous eye in all his tail; and for lilies, though the great King
of Israel was not "arrayed" like one of them, can Mr.Garbett tell us
which are their superfluous leaves?Is there no Diogenes among lilies?none to be found content to drink dew, but out of silver?The fact is, I
never met with the architect yet who did not think ornament meant a
thing to be bought in a shop and pinned on, or left off, at
architectural toilets, as the fancy seized them, thinking little more
than many women do of the other kind of ornament--the only true
kind,--St.Peter's kind,--"Not that outward adorning, but the inner--of
the heart."I do not mean that architects cannot conceive this better
ornament, but they do not understand that it is the _only_ ornament;
that _all_ architectural ornament is this, and nothing but this; that a
noble building never has any extraneous or superfluous ornament; that
all its parts are necessary to its loveliness, and that no single atom
of them could be removed without harm to its life.You do not build a
temple and then dress it.[101] You create it in its loveliness, and
leave it, as her Maker left Eve.Not unadorned, I believe, but so well
adorned as to need no feather crowns.And I use the words ornament and
beauty interchangeably, in order that architects may understand this: I
assume that their building is to be a perfect creature capable of
nothing less than it has, and needing nothing more.It may, indeed,
receive additional decoration afterwards, exactly as a woman may
gracefully put a bracelet on her arm, or set a flower in her hair: but
that additional decoration is _not_ the _architecture_.It is of
curtains, pictures, statues, things that may be taken away from the
building, and not hurt it.He
has only to do with what is part of the building itself, that is to say,
its own inherent beauty.Garbett does not understand or
acknowledge this, he is led on from error to error; for we next find him
endeavoring to define beauty as distinct from ornament, and saying that
"Positive beauty may be produced by a studious collation of whatever
will display design, order, and congruity."There
is a highly studious collation of whatever will display design, order,
and congruity, in a skull, is there not?--yet small beauty.The nose is
a decorative feature,--yet slightly necessary to beauty, it seems to me;
now, at least, for I once thought I must be wrong in considering a skull
disagreeable.I gave it fair trial: put one on my bed-room
chimney-piece, and looked at it by sunrise every morning, and by
moonlight every night, and by all the best lights I could think of, for
a month, in vain.I found it as ugly at last as I did at first.So,
also, the hair is a decoration, and its natural curl is of little use;
but can Mr.Garbett conceive a bald beauty; or does he prefer a wig,
because that is a "_studious_ collation" of whatever will produce
design, order, and congruity?So the flush of the cheek is a
decoration,--God's painting of the temple of his spirit,--and the
redness of the lip; and yet poor Viola thought it beauty truly blent;
and I hold with her.The second point questioned is my assertion, "Ornament cannot be
overcharged if it is good, and is always overcharged when it is bad."Garbett objects in these terms: "I must contend, on the
contrary, that the very best ornament may be overcharged by being
misplaced."Garbett cannot get rid of his unfortunate notion that
ornament is a thing to be manufactured separately, and fastened on.He
supposes that an ornament may be called good in itself, in the
stonemason's yard or in the ironmonger's shop: Once for all, let him put
this idea out of his head.We may say of a thing, considered separately,
that it is a pretty thing; but before we can say it is a good ornament,
we must know what it is to adorn, and how.As, for instance, a ring of
gold is a pretty thing; it is a good ornament on a woman's finger; not a
good ornament hung through her under lip.A hollyhock, seven feet high,
would be a good ornament for a cottage-garden; not a good ornament for a
lady's head-dress.Garbett have seen this without my
showing?and that, therefore, when I said "_good_" ornament, I said
"well-placed" ornament, in one word, and that, also, when Mr.Garbett
says "it may be overcharged by being misplaced," he merely says it may
be overcharged by being _bad_.But, granted that ornament _were_ independent of its position,
and might be pronounced good in a separate form, as books are good, or
men are good.--Suppose I had written to a student in Oxford, "You cannot
have too many books, if they be good books;" and he had answered me,
"Yes, for if I have many, I have no place to put them in but the
coal-cellar."Would that in anywise affect the general principle that
he could not have too many books?Or suppose he had written, "I must not have too many, they confuse my
head."I should have written back to him: "Don't buy books to put in the
coal-hole, nor read them if they confuse your head; you cannot have too
many, if they be good: but if you are too lazy to take care of them, or
too dull to profit by them, you are better without them."Exactly in the same tone, I repeat to Mr.Garbett, "You cannot have too
much ornament, if it be good: but if you are too indolent to arrange it,
or too dull to take advantage of it, assuredly you are better without
it."The other points bearing on this question have already been stated in
the close of the 21st chapter.The third reference I have to answer, is to my repeated assertion, that
the evidence of manual labor is one of the chief sources of value in
ornament, ("Seven Lamps," p.III.,)
to which objection is made in these terms: "We must here warn the reader
against a remarkable error of Ruskin.The value of ornaments in
architecture depends _not in the slightest degree_ on the _manual labor_
they contain.If it did, the finest ornaments ever executed would be the
stone chains that hang before certain Indian rock-temples.""The value of the Cornish mines depends not in
the slightest degree on the quantity of copper they contain.If it did,
the most valuable things ever produced would be copper saucepans."It is
hardly worth my while to answer this; but, lest any of my readers should
be confused by the objection, and as I hold the fact to be of great
importance, I may re-state it for them with some explanation.Observe, then, the appearance of labor, that is to say, the evidence of
the past industry of man, is always, in the abstract, intensely
delightful: man being meant to labor, it is delightful to see that he
_has_ labored, and to read the record of his active and worthy
existence.The evidence of labor becomes painful only when it is a _sign of Evil
greater, as Evil, than the labor is great, as Good_.As, for instance,
if a man has labored for an hour at what might have been done by another
man in a moment, this evidence of his labor is also evidence of his
weakness; and this weakness is greater in rank of evil, than his
industry is great in rank of good.Again, if a man have labored at what was not worth accomplishing, the
signs of his labor are the signs of his folly, and his folly dishonors
his industry; we had rather he had been a wise man in rest than a fool
in labor.Again, if a man have labored without accomplishing anything, the signs
of his labor are the signs of his disappointment; and we have more
sorrow in sympathy with his failure, than pleasure in sympathy with his
work.Now, therefore, in ornament, whenever labor replaces what was better
than labor, that is to say, skill and thought; wherever it substitutes
itself for these, or _negatives these by its existence_, then it is
positive evil.Copper is an evil when it alloys gold, or poisons food:
not an evil, as copper; good in the form of pence, seriously
objectionable when it occupies the room of guineas.Let Danae cast it
out of her lap, when the gold comes from heaven; but let the poor man
gather it up carefully from the earth.Farther, the evidence of labor is not only a good when added to other
good, but the utter absence of it destroys good in human work.It is
only good for God to create without toil; that which man can create
without toil is worthless: machine ornaments are no ornaments at all.Consider this carefully, reader: I could illustrate it for you
endlessly; but you feel it yourself every hour of your existence.And if
you do not know that you feel it, take up, for a little time, the trade
which of all manual trades has been most honored: be for once a
carpenter.Make for yourself a table or a chair, and see if you ever
thought any table or chair so delightful, and what strange beauty there
will be in their crooked limbs.I have not noticed any other animadversions on the "Seven Lamps" in Mr.Garbett's volume; but if there be more, I must now leave it to his own
consideration, whether he may not, as in the above instances, have made
them incautiously: I may, perhaps, also be permitted to request other
architects, who may happen to glance at the preceding pages, not
immediately to condemn what may appear to them false in general
principle.I must often be found deficient in technical knowledge; I
may often err in my statements respecting matters of practice or of
special law.But I do not write thoughtlessly respecting principles; and
my statements of these will generally be found worth reconnoitring
before attacking.Architects, no doubt, fancy they have strong grounds
for supposing me wrong when they seek to invalidate my assertions.Let
me assure them, at least, that I mean to be their friend, although they
may not immediately recognise me as such.If I could obtain the public
ear, and the principles I have advocated were carried into general
practice, porphyry and serpentine would be given to them instead of
limestone and brick; instead of tavern and shop-fronts they would have
to build goodly churches and noble dwelling-houses; and for every
stunted Grecism and stucco Romanism, into which they are now forced to
shape their palsied thoughts, and to whose crumbling plagiarisms they
must trust their doubtful fame, they would be asked to raise whole
streets of bold, and rich, and living architecture, with the certainty
in their hearts of doing what was honorable to themselves, and good for
all men.Before I altogether leave the question of the influence of labor on
architectural effect, the reader may expect from me a word or two
respecting the subject which this year must be interesting to all--the
applicability, namely, of glass and iron to architecture in general, as
in some sort exemplified by the Crystal Palace.It is thought by many that we shall forthwith have great part of our
architecture in glass and iron, and that new forms of beauty will result
from the studied employment of these materials.It may be told in a few words how far this is possible; how far
eternally impossible.There are two means of delight in all productions of art--color and
form.The most vivid conditions of color attainable by human art are those of
works in glass and enamel, but not the most perfect.The best and
noblest coloring possible to art is that attained by the touch of the
human hand on an opaque surface, upon which it can command any tint
required, without subjection to alteration by fire or other mechanical
means.No color is so noble as the color of a good painting on canvas or
gesso.This kind of color being, however, impossible, for the most part, in
architecture, the next best is the scientific disposition of the natural
colors of stones, which are far nobler than any abstract hues producible
by human art.The delight which we receive from glass painting is one altogether
inferior, and in which we should degrade ourselves by over indulgence.Nevertheless, it is possible that we may raise some palaces like
Aladdin's with  glass for jewels, which shall be new in the annals
of human splendor, and good in their place; but not if they superseded
nobler edifices.Now, color is producible either on opaque or in transparent bodies: but
form is only expressible, in its perfection, on opaque bodies, without
lustre.This law is imperative, universal, irrevocable.No perfect or refined
form can be expressed except in opaque and lustreless matter.You cannot
see the form of a jewel, nor, in any perfection, even of a cameo or
bronze.You cannot perfectly see the form of a humming-bird, on account
of its burnishing; but you can see the form of a swan perfectly.No noble
work in form can ever, therefore, be produced in transparent or lustrous
glass or enamel.All noble architecture depends for its majesty on its
form: therefore you can never have any noble architecture in transparent
or lustrous glass or enamel.Iron is, however, opaque; and both it and
opaque enamel may, perhaps, be rendered quite lustreless; and, therefore,
fit to receive noble form.Let this be thoroughly done, and both the iron and enamel made fine in
paste or grain, and you may have an architecture as noble as cast or
struck architecture even can be: as noble, therefore, as coins can be, or
common cast bronzes, and such other multiplicable things;[102]--eternally
separated from all good and great things by a gulph which not all the
tubular bridges nor engineering of ten thousand nineteenth centuries cast
into one great bronze-foreheaded century, will ever overpass one inch of.All art which is worth its room in this world, all art which is not a
piece of blundering refuse, occupying the foot or two of earth which, if
unencumbered by it, would have grown corn or violets, or some better
thing, is _art which proceeds from an individual mind, working through
instruments which assist, but do not supersede, the muscular action of
the human hand, upon the materials which most tenderly receive, and most
securely retain, the impressions of such human labor_.And the value of every work of art is exactly in the ratio of the
quantity of humanity which has been put into it, and legibly expressed
upon it for ever:--

First, of thought and moral purpose;

Secondly, of technical skill;

Thirdly, of bodily industry.The quantity of bodily industry which that Crystal Palace expresses is
very great.The quantity of thought it expresses is, I suppose, a single and very
admirable thought of Mr.Paxton's, probably not a bit brighter than
thousands of thoughts which pass through his active and intelligent
brain every hour,--that it might be possible to build a greenhouse
larger than ever greenhouse was built before.This thought, and some
very ordinary algebra, are as much as all that glass can represent of
human intellect."But one poor half-pennyworth of bread to all this
intolerable deal of sack.""The earth hath bubbles as the water hath:
   And this is of them."The depth of the cutting in some of the early English capitals is,
indeed, part of a general system of attempts at exaggerated force of
effect, like the "_black_ touches" of second-rate draughtsmen, which I
have noticed as characteristic of nearly all northern work, associated
with the love of the grotesque: but the main section of the capital is
indeed a dripstone rolled round, as above described; and dripstone
sections are continually found in northern work, where not only they
cannot increase force of effect, but are entirely invisible except on
close examination; as, for instance, under the uppermost range of stones
of the foundation of Whitehall, or under the <DW72> of the restored base
of All Souls College, Oxford, under the level of the eye.I much doubt
if any of the Fellows be aware of its existence.Many readers will be surprised and displeased by the disparagement of
the early English capital.That capital has, indeed, one character of
considerable value; namely, the boldness with which it stops the
mouldings which fall upon it, and severs them from the shaft,
contrasting itself with the multiplicity of their vertical lines.Sparingly used, or seldom seen, it is thus, in its place, not
unpleasing; and we English love it from association, it being always
found in connection with our purest and loveliest Gothic arches, and
never in multitudes large enough to satiate the eye with its form.The
reader who sits in the Temple church every Sunday, and sees no
architecture during the week but that of Chancery Lane, may most
justifiably quarrel with me for what I have said of it.But if every
house in Fleet Street or Chancery Lane were Gothic, and all had early
English capitals, I would answer for his making peace with me in a
fortnight.Whose they are, is of little consequence to the reader or to me, and I
have taken no pains to discover; their value being not in any evidence
they bear respecting dates, but in their intrinsic merit as examples of
composition.Two of them are within the gate, one on the top of it, and
this latter is on the whole the best, though all are beautiful; uniting
the intense northern energy in their figure sculpture with the most
serene classical restraint in their outlines, and unaffected, but
masculine simplicity of construction.I have not put letters to the diagram of the lateral arch at page 154,
in order not to interfere with the clearness of the curves, but I shall
always express the same points by the same letters, whenever I have to
give measures of arches of this simple kind, so that the reader need
never have the diagrams lettered at all.The base or span of the centre
arch will always be _a b_; its vertex will always be V; the points of
the cusps will be _c c_; _p p_ will be the bases of perpendiculars let
fall from V and _c_ on _a b_; and _d_ the base of a perpendicular from
the point of the cusp to the arch line.Then _a b_ will always be a span
of the arch, V _p_ its perpendicular height, V _a_ the chord of its side
arcs, _d c_ the depth of its cusps, _c c_ the horizontal interval
between the cusps, _a c_ the length of the chord of the lower arc of the
cusp, V _c_ the length of the chord of the upper arc of the cusp,
(whether continuous or not,) and _c p_ the length of a perpendicular
from the point of the cusp on _a b_.Of course we do not want all these measures for a single arch, but it
often happens that some of them are attainable more easily than others;
some are often unattainable altogether, and it is necessary therefore to
have expressions for whichever we may be able to determine.V _p_ or V _a_, _a b_, and _d c_ are always essential; then either _a c_
and V _c_ or _c c_ and _c p_: when I have my choice, I always take _a
b_, V _p_, _d c_, _c c_, and _c p_, but _c p_ is not to be generally
obtained so accurately as the cusp arcs.The measures of the present arch are:

           Ft._a b_,    3,, 8
  V _p_,    4,, 0
  V _c_,    2,, 4-1/2
  _a c_,    2,, 0-1/4
  _d c_,    0,, 3-1/2


                   20.SHAFTS OF DUCAL PALACE.The shortness of the thicker ones at the angles is induced by the
greater depth of the enlarged capitals: thus the 36th shaft is 10 ft.in circumference at its base, and 10,, 0-1/2[103] in
circumference under the fillet of its capital; but it is only 6,,
1-3/4 high, while the minor intermediate shafts, of which the thickest
is 7,, 8 round at the base, and 7,, 4 under capital, are yet on the
average 7,, 7 high.The angle shaft towards the sea (the 18th) is
nearly of the proportions of the 36th, and there are three others, the
15th, 24th, and 26th, which are thicker than the rest, though not so
thick as the angle ones.The 24th and 26th have both party walls to
bear, and I imagine the 15th must in old time have carried another,
reaching across what is now the Sala del Gran Consiglio.They measure respectively round at the base,

  The 15th, 8,, 2
      24th, 9,, 6-1/2
      26th, 8,, 0-1/2

The other pillars towards the sea, and those to the 27th inclusive of
the Piazzetta, are all seven feet round at the base, and then there is a
most curious and delicate crescendo of circumference to the 36th, thus:

  The 28th, 7,, 3   The 33rd, 7,, 6
      29th, 7,, 4       34th, 7,, 8
      30th, 7,, 6       35th, 7,, 8
      31st, 7,, 7       36th, 10,, 4-1/3
      32nd, 7,, 5

The shafts of the upper arcade, which are above these thicker columns,
are also thicker than their companions, measuring on the average, 4,,
8-1/2 in circumference, while those of the sea facade, except the 29th,
average 4,, 7-1/2 in circumference.The 29th, which is of course above
the 15th of the lower story, is 5,, 5 in circumference, which little
piece of evidence will be of no small value to us by-and-by.The 35th
carries the angle of the palace, and is 6,, 0 round.The 47th, which
comes above the 24th and carries the party wall of the Sala del Gran
Consiglio, is strengthened by a pilaster; and the 51st, which comes over
the 26th, is 5,, 4-1/2 round, or nearly the same as the 29th; it
carries the party wall of the Sala del Scrutinio; a small room
containing part of St.Mark's library, coming between the two saloons;
a room which, in remembrances of the help I have received in all my
inquiries from the kindness and intelligence of its usual occupant, I
shall never easily distinguish otherwise than as "Mr."[104]

I may as well connect with these notes respecting the arcades of the
Ducal Palace, those which refer to Plate XIV., which represents one of
its spandrils.Every spandril of the lower arcade was intended to have
been occupied by an ornament resembling the one given in that plate.The
mass of the building being of Istrian stone, a depth of about two inches
is left within the mouldings of the arches, rough hewn, to receive the
slabs of fine marble composing the patterns.I cannot say whether the
design was ever completed, or the marbles have been since removed, but
there are now only two spandrils retaining their fillings, and vestiges
of them in a third.The two complete spandrils are on the sea facade,
above the 3rd and 10th capitals (_vide_ method of numbering, Chap.I.,
page 30); that is to say, connecting the 2nd arch with the 3rd, and the
9th with the 10th.The latter is the one given in Plate XIV.The white
portions of it are all white marble, the dental band surrounding the
circle is in coarse sugary marble, which I believe to be Greek, and
never found in Venice to my recollection, except in work at least
anterior to the fifteenth century.The shaded fields charged with the
three white triangles are of red Verona marble; the inner disc is green
serpentine, and the dark pieces of the radiating leaves are grey marble.The two uppermost are 1,, 5 each
side, and the lower 1,, 2.The extreme diameter of the circle is 3,, 10-1/2; its field is slightly
raised above the red marbles, as shown in the section at A, on the left.A _a_ is part of the red marble field; _a b_ the section of the dentil
moulding let into it; _b c_ the entire breadth of the rayed zone,
represented on the other side of the spandril by the line C _f_; _c d_
is the white marble band let in, with the dogtooth on the face of it;
_b c_ is 7-3/4 inches across; _c d_ 3-3/4; and at B are given two joints
of the dentil (mentioned above, in the chapter on dentils, as unique in
Venice) of their actual size.At C is given one of the inlaid leaves;
its measure being (in inches) C _f_ 7-3/4; C _h_ 3/4; _f g_ 3/4; _f e_
4-3/4, the base of the smaller leaves being of course _f e_ - _f g_ = 4.The pattern which occupies the other spandril is similar, except that
the field _b c_, instead of the intersecting arcs, has only triangles of
grey marble, arranged like rays, with their bases towards the centre.There being twenty round the circle, the reader can of course draw them
for himself; they being isosceles, touching the dentil with their
points, and being in contact at their bases: it has lost its central
boss.The marbles are, in both, covered with a rusty coating, through
which it is excessively difficult to distinguish the colors (another
proof of the age of the ornament).But the white marbles are certainly,
in places (except only the sugary dentil), veined with purple, and the
grey seem warmed with green.A trace of another of these ornaments may be seen over the 21st capital;
but I doubt if the marbles have ever been inserted in the other
spandrils, and their want of ornament occasions the slight meagreness in
the effect of the lower story, which is almost the only fault of the
building.This decoration by discs, or shield-like ornaments, is a marked
characteristic of Venetian architecture in its earlier ages, and is
carried into later times by the Byzantine Renaissance, already
distinguished from the more corrupt forms of Renaissance, in Appendix 6.Of the disc decoration, so borrowed, we have already an example in Plate
I. In Plate VII.we have an earlier condition of it, one of the discs
being there sculptured, the others surrounded by sculptured bands: here
we have, on the Ducal Palace, the most characteristic of all, because
likest to the shield, which was probably the origin of the same ornament
among the Arabs, and assuredly among the Greeks.Donaldson's
restoration of the gate of the treasury of Atreus, this ornament is
conjecturally employed, and it occurs constantly on the Arabian
buildings of Cairo.ANCIENT REPRESENTATIONS OF WATER.I have long been desirous of devoting some time to an enquiry into the
effect of natural scenery upon the pagan, and especially the Greek,
mind, and knowing that my friend, Mr.C. Newton, had devoted much
thought to the elucidation of the figurative and symbolic language of
ancient art, I asked him to draw up for me a few notes of the facts
which he considered most interesting, as illustrative of its methods of
representing nature.I suggested to him, for an initiative subject, the
representation of water; because this is one of the natural objects
whose portraiture may most easily be made a test of treatment, for it is
one of universal interest, and of more closely similar aspect in all
parts of the world than any other.Waves, currents, and eddies are much
liker each other, everywhere, than either land or vegetation.Rivers and
lakes, indeed, differ widely from the sea, and the clear Pacific from
the angry Northern ocean; but the Nile is liker the Danube than a knot
of Nubian palms is to a glade of the Black Forest; and the Mediterranean
is liker the Atlantic than the Campo Felice is like Solway moss.Newton has accordingly most kindly furnished me with the following
data.One or two of the types which he describes have been already
noticed in the main text; but it is well that the reader should again
contemplate them in the position which they here occupy in a general
system.Newton's definitions of
the terms "figurative" and "symbolic," as applied to art, in the
beginning of the paper.*       *       *       *       *

In ancient art, that is to say, in the art of the Egyptian, Assyrian,
Greek, and Roman races, water is, for the most part, represented
conventionally rather than naturally.By natural representation is here meant as just and perfect an imitation
of nature as the technical means of art will allow: on the other hand,
representation is said to be conventional, either when a confessedly
inadequate imitation is accepted in default of a better, or when
imitation is not attempted at all, and it is agreed that other modes of
representation, those by figures or by symbols, shall be its substitute
and equivalent.In figurative representation there is always _impersonation_; the
sensible form, borrowed by the artist from organic life, is conceived to
be actuated by a will, and invested with such mental attributes as
constitute personality.The sensible _symbol_, whether borrowed from organic or from inorganic
nature, is not a personification at all, but the conventional sign or
equivalent of some object or notion, to which it may perhaps bear no
visible resemblance, but with which the intellect or the imagination has
in some way associated it.For instance, a city may be figuratively represented as a woman crowned
with towers; here the artist has selected for the expression of his idea
a human form animated with a will and motives of action analogous to
those of humanity generally.Or, again, as in Greek art, a bull may be a
figurative representation of a river, and, in the conception of the
artist, this animal form may contain, and be ennobled by, a human mind.This is still impersonation; the form only in which personality is
embodied is changed.Again, a dolphin may be used as a symbol of the sea; a man ploughing
with two oxen is a well-known symbol of a Roman colony.In neither of
these instances is there impersonation.The dolphin is not invested,
like the figure of Neptune, with any of the attributes of the human
mind; it has animal instincts, but no will; it represents to us its
native element, only as a part may be taken for a whole.Again, the man ploughing does not, like the turreted female figure,
_personify_, but rather _typifies_ the town, standing as the visible
representation of a real event, its first foundation.To our mental
perceptions, as to our bodily senses, this figure seems no more than
man; there is no blending of his personal nature with the impersonal
nature of the colony, no transfer of attributes from the one to the
other.Though the conventionally imitative, the figurative, and the symbolic,
are three distinct kinds of representation, they are constantly combined
in one composition, as we shall see in the following examples, cited
from the art of successive races in chronological order.In Egyptian art the general representation of water is the
conventionally imitative.In the British Museum are two frescoes from
tombs at Thebes, Nos.177 and 170: the subject of the first of these is
an oblong pond, ground-plan and elevation being strangely confused in
the design.In this pond water is represented by parallel zigzag lines,
in which fish are swimming about.On the surface are birds and lotos
flowers; the herbage at the edge of the pond is represented by a border
of symmetrical fan-shaped flowers; the field beyond by rows of trees,
arranged round the sides of the pond at right angles to each other, and
in defiance of all laws of perspective.170, we have the representation of a river with
papyrus on its bank.Here the water is rendered by zigzag lines arranged
vertically and in parallel lines, so as to resemble herring-bone
masonry, thus.There are fish in this fresco as in the preceding, and in
both each fish is drawn very distinctly, not as it would appear to the
eye viewed through water.The mode of representing this element in
Egyptian painting is further abbreviated in their hieroglyphic writing,
where the sign of water is a zigzag line; this line is, so to speak, a
picture of water written in short hand.In the Egyptian Pantheon there
was but one aquatic deity, the god of the Nile; his type is, therefore,
the only figurative representation of water in Egyptian art.(Birch,
"Gallery of British Museum Antiquities," Pl.In Assyrian sculpture
we have very curious conventionally imitative representations of water.On several of the friezes from Nimroud and Khorsabad, men are seen
crossing a river in boats, or in skins, accompanied by horses swimming
(see Layard, ii.In these scenes water is represented by masses
of wavy lines somewhat resembling tresses of hair, and terminating in
curls or volutes; these wavy lines express the general character of a
deep and rapid current, like that of the Tigris.Fish are but sparingly
introduced, the idea of surface being sufficiently expressed by the
floating figures and boats.In the representation of these there is the
same want of perspective as in the Egyptian fresco which we have just
cited.In the Assyrian Pantheon one aquatic deity has been discovered, the god
Dagon, whose human form terminates in a fish's tail.Of the character
and attributes of this deity we know but little.The more abbreviated mode of representing water, the zigzag line, occurs
on the large silver coins with the type of a city or a war galley (see
Layard, ii.These coins were probably struck in Assyria, not
long after the conquest of it by the Persians.In Greek art the modes of representing water are far more varied.Two
conventional imitations, the wave moulding and the Maeander, are well
known.Both are probably of the most remote antiquity; both have been
largely employed as an architectural ornament, and subordinately as a
decoration of vases, costume, furniture and implements.In the wave
moulding we have a conventional representation of the small crisping
waves which break upon the shore of the Mediterranean, the sea of the
Greeks.Their regular succession, and equality of force and volume, are
generalised in this moulding, while the minuter varieties which
distinguish one wave from another are merged in the general type.The
character of ocean waves is to be "for ever changing, yet the same for
ever;" it is this eternity of recurrence which the early artist has
expressed in this hieroglyphic.With this profile representation of water may be compared the sculptured
waves out of which the head and arms of Hyperion are rising in the
pediment of the Parthenon (Elgin Room, No.(65) 91, Museum Marbles, vi.Phidias has represented these waves like a mass of overlapping
tiles, thus generalising their rippling movement.In the Maeander pattern
the graceful curves of nature are represented by angles, as in the
Egyptian hieroglyphic of water: so again the earliest representation of
the labyrinth on the coins of the Cnossus is rectangular; on later coins
we find the curvilinear form introduced.In the language of Greek mythography, the wave pattern and the Maeander
are sometimes used singly for the idea of water, but more frequently
combined with figurative representation.The number of aquatic deities
in the Greek Pantheon led to the invention of a great variety of
beautiful types.Everybody is
familiar with the general form of Poseidon (Neptune), the Nereids, the
Nymphs and River Gods; but the modes in which these types were combined
with conventional imitation and with accessory symbols deserve careful
study, if we would appreciate the surpassing richness and beauty of the
language of art formed out of these elements.This class of representations may be divided into two principal groups,
those relating to the sea, and those relating to fresh water.The power of the ocean and the great features of marine scenery are
embodied in such types as Poseidon, Nereus and the Nereids, that is to
say, in human forms moving through the liquid element in chariots, or on
the back of dolphins, or who combine the human form with that of the
fish-like Tritons.The sea-monsters who draw these chariots are called
Hippocamps, being composed of the tail of a fish and the fore-part of a
horse, the legs terminating in web-feet: this union seems to express
speed and power under perfect control, such as would characterise the
movements of sea deities.A few examples have been here selected to show
how these types were combined with symbols and conventional imitation.In the British Museum is a vase, No.1257, engraved (Lenormant et De
Witte, Mon.27), of which the subject is, Europa crossing
the sea on the back of the bull.In this design the sea is represented
by a variety of expedients.First, the swimming action of the bull
suggests the idea of the liquid medium through which he moves.Behind
him stands Nereus, his staff held perpendicularly in his hand; the top
of his staff comes nearly to the level of the bull's back, and is
probably meant as the measure of the whole depth of the sea.Towards the
surface line thus indicated a dolphin is rising; in the middle depth is
another dolphin; below a shrimp and a cuttle-fish, and the bottom is
indicated by a jagged line of rocks, on which are two echini.On a mosaic found at Oudnah in Algeria (Revue Archeol., iii.50), we
have a representation of the sea, remarkable for the fulness of details
with which it is made out.This, though of the Roman period, is so thoroughly Greek in feeling,
that it may be cited as an example of the class of mythography now under
consideration.The mosaic lines the floor and sides of a bath, and, as
was commonly the case in the baths of the ancients, serves as a
figurative representation of the water it contained.On the sides are hippocamps, figures riding on dolphins, and islands on
which fishermen stand; on the floor are fish, crabs, and shrimps.These, as in the vase with Europa, indicate the bottom of the sea: the
same symbols of the submarine world appear on many other ancient
designs.Thus in vase pictures, when Poseidon upheaves the island of Cos
to overwhelm the Giant Polydotes, the island is represented as an
immense mass of rock; the parts which have been under water are
indicated by a dolphin, a shrimp, and a sepia, the parts above the water
by a goat and a serpent (Lenormant et De Witte, i., tav.Sometimes these symbols occur singly in Greek art, as the types, for
instance, of coins.In such cases they cannot be interpreted without
being viewed in relation to the whole context of mythography to which
they belong.If we find, for example, on one coin of Tarentum a shell,
on another a dolphin, on a third a figure of Tarus, the mythic founder
of the town, riding on a dolphin in the midst of the waves, and this
latter group expresses the idea of the town itself and its position on
the coast, then we know the two former types to be but portions of the
greater design, having been detached from it, as we may detach words
from sentences.The study of the fuller and clearer examples, such as we have cited
above, enables us to explain many more compendious forms of expression.We have, for instance, on coins several representations of ancient
harbors.Of these, the earliest occurs on the coins of Zancle, the modern Messina
in Sicily.The ancients likened the form of this harbor to a sickle, and
on the coins of the town we find a curved object, within the area of
which is a dolphin.On this curve are four square elevations placed at
equal distances.It has been conjectured that these projections are
either towers or the large stones to which galleys were moored still to
be seen in ancient harbors (see Burgon, Numismatic Chronicle, iii.With this archaic representation of a harbor may be compared some
examples of the Roman period.Severus struck at
Corinth (Millingen, Sylloge of Uned.30) we have a female figure standing on a rock between two recumbent
male figures holding rudders.From an arch at the foot of the rock a
stream is flowing: this is a representation of the rock of the Acropolis
of Corinth: the female figure is a statue of Aphrodite, whose temple
surmounted the rock.The two
recumbent figures are impersonations of the two harbors, Lechreum and
Cenchreia, between which Corinth was situated.16) describes a similar picture of the Isthmus between the two
harbors, one of which was in the form of a youth, the other of a nymph.On another coin of Corinth we have one of the harbors in a semicircular
form, the whole arc being marked with small equal divisions, to denote
the archways under which the ancient galleys were drawn, _subductae_; at
the either horn or extremity of the harbor is a temple; in the centre of
the mouth, a statue of Neptune.(Millingen, Medailles Ined., Pl.Compare also Millingen, Ancient Coins of Cities and Kings, 1831,
pp.246; and the
harbor of Ostium, on the large brass coins of Nero, in which there is a
representation of the Roman fleet and a reclining figure of Neptune.)In vase pictures we have occasionally an attempt to represent water
naturally.On a vase in the British Museum (No.785), of which the
subject is Ulysses and the Sirens, the Sea is rendered by wavy lines
drawn in black on a red ground, and something like the effect of light
playing on the surface of the water is given.On each side of the ship
are shapeless masses of rock on which the Sirens stand.One of the most beautiful of the figurative representations of the sea
is the well-known type of Scylla.She has a beautiful body, terminating
in two barking dogs and two serpent tails.Sometimes drowning men, the
_rari nantes in gurgite vasto_, appear caught up in the coils of these
tails.Scylla generally brandishes a rudder to show
the manner in which she twists the course of ships.For varieties of her
type see Monum.The representations of fresh water may be arranged under the following
heads--rivers, lakes, fountains.There are several figurative modes of representing rivers very
frequently employed in ancient mythography.In the type which occurs earliest we have the human form combined with
that of the bull in several ways.On an archaic coin of Metapontum in
Lucania, (see frontispiece to Millingen, Ancient Coins of Greek Cities
and Kings,) the river Achelous is represented with the figure of a man
with a shaggy beard and bull's horns and ears.On a vase of the best
period of Greek art (Brit.of
Lit., New Series, Lond.100) the same river is represented
with a satyr's head and long bull's horns on the forehead; his form,
human to the waist, terminates in a fish's tail; his hair falls down his
back; his beard is long and shaggy.In this type we see a combination of
the three forms separately enumerated by Sophocles, in the commencement
of the Trachiniae.[Greek: Acheloon lego,
  os m' en trisin morphaisin exetei patros,
  phoiton enarges auros allot' aiolos,
  drakon heliktos, allot' andreio kytei
  bouproros, ek de daskiou geneiados
  krounoi dierrhainonto krenaiou potou].In a third variety of this type the human-headed body is united at the
waist with the shoulders of a bull's body, in which it terminates.This
occurs on an early vase.On the coins of Oeniadae
in Acarnia, and on those of Ambracia, all of the period after Alexander
the Great, the Achelous has a bull's body, and head with a human face.In this variety of the type the human element is almost absorbed, as in
the first variety cited above, the coin of Metapontum, the bull portion
of the type is only indicated by the addition of the horns and ears to
the human head.On the analogy between these, varieties in the type of
the Achelous and those under which the metamorphoses of the marine
goddess Thetis are represented, see Gerhard, Auserl.It is probable that, in the type of Thetis, of Proteus, and
also of the Achelous, the singular combinations and transformations are
intended to express the changeful nature of the element water.Numerous other examples may be cited, where rivers are represented by
this combination of the bull and human form, which maybe called, for
convenience, the Androtauric type.On the coins of Sicily, of the
archaic and also of the finest period of art, rivers are most usually
represented by a youthful male figure, with small budding horns; the
hair has the lank and matted form which characterises aquatic deities in
Greek mythography.The name of the river is often inscribed round the
head.When the whole figure occurs on the coin, it is always represented
standing, never reclining.The type of the bull on the coins of Sybaris and Thurium, in Magna
Graecia, has been considered, with great probability, a representation of
this kind.On the coins of Sybaris, which are of a very early period,
the head of the bull is turned round; on those of Thurium, he stoops his
head, butting: the first of these actions has been thought to symbolise
the winding course of the river, the second, its headlong current.On
the coins of Thurium, the idea of water is further suggested by the
adjunct of dolphins and other fish in the exergue of the coin.The
ground on which the bull stands is indicated by herbage or pebbles.Two bulls' head occur on the coins
of Sardis, and it has been ingeniously conjectured by Mr.Burgon that
the two rivers of the place are expressed under this type.The representation of river-gods as human figures in a reclining
position, though probably not so much employed in earlier Greek art as
the Androtauric type, is very much more familiar to us, from its
subsequent adoption in Roman mythography.The earliest example we have
of a reclining river-god is in the figure in the Elgin Room commonly
called the Ilissus, but more probably the Cephissus.This occupied one
angle in the western pediment of the Parthenon; the other Athenian
river, the Ilissus, and the fountain Callirrhoe being represented by a
male and female figure in the opposite angle; this group, now destroyed,
is visible in the drawing made by Carrey in 1678.It is probable that the necessities of pedimental composition first led
the artist to place the river-god in a reclining position.The head of
the Ilissus being broken off, we are not sure whether he had bull's
horns, like the Sicilian figures already described.His form is
youthful, in the folds of the drapery behind him there is a flow like
that of waves, but the idea of water is not suggested by any other
symbol.When we compare this figure with that of the Nile (Visconti,
Mus.38), and the figure of the Tiber in the Louvre,
both of which are of the Roman period, we see how in these later types
the artist multiplied symbols and accessories, ingrafting them on the
original simple type of the river-god, as it was conceived by Phidias in
the figure of the Ilissus.The Nile is represented as a colossal bearded
figure reclining.At his side is a cornucopia, full of the vegetable
produce of the Egyptian soil.Round his body are sixteen naked boys, who
represent the sixteen cubits, the height to which the river rose in a
favorable year.The statue is placed on a basement divided into three
compartments, one above another.In the uppermost of these, waves are
flowing over in one great sheet from the side of the river-god.In the
other two compartments are the animals and plants of the river; the
bas-reliefs on this basement are, in fact, a kind of abbreviated
symbolic panorama of the Nile.The Tiber is represented in a very similar manner.On the base are, in
two compartments, scenes taken from the early Roman myths; flocks,
herds, and other objects on the banks of the river.39; Millin, Galerie Mythol., i. p.In the types of the Greek coins of Camarina, we find two interesting
representations of Lakes.On the obverse of one of these we have, within
a circle of the wave pattern, a male head, full face, with dishevelled
hair, and with a dolphin on either side; on the reverse a female figure
sailing on a swan, below which a wave moulding, and above, a dolphin.On another coin the swan type of the reverse is associated with the
youthful head of a river-god, inscribed "Hipparis" on the obverse.On
some smaller coins we have the swan flying over the rippling waves,
which are represented by the wave moulding.When we examine the chart of
Sicily, made by the Admiralty survey, we find marked down at Camarina, a
lake through which the river Hipparis flows.We can hardly doubt that the inhabitants of Camarina represented both
their river and their lakes on their coins.The swan flying over the
waves would represent a lake; the figure associated with it being no
doubt the Aphrodite worshipped at that place: the head, in a circle of
wave pattern, may express that part of the river which flows through the
lake.Fountains are usually represented by a stream of water issuing from a
lion's head in the rock: see a vase (Gerhard, Auserl.), where Hercules stands, receiving a shower-bath from a hot
spring at Thermae in Sicily.On the coins of Syracuse the fountain
Arethusa is represented by a female head seen to the front; the flowing
lines of her dishevelled hair suggest, though they do not directly
imitate, the bubbling action of the fresh-water spring; the sea in which
it rises is symbolized by the dolphins round the head.This type
presents a striking analogy with that of the Camarina head in the circle
of wave pattern described above.These are the principal modes of representing water in Greek
mythography.In the art of the Roman period, the same kind of figurative
and symbolic language is employed, but there is a constant tendency to
multiply accessories and details, as we have shown in the later
representations of harbors and river-gods cited above.In these crowded
compositions the eye is fatigued and distracted by the quantity it has
to examine; the language of art becomes more copious but less terse and
emphatic, and addresses itself to minds far less intelligent than the
refined critics who were the contemporaries of Phidias.Rivers in Roman art are usually represented by reclining male figures,
generally bearded, holding reeds or other plants in their hands, and
leaning on urns from which water is flowing.On the coins of many Syrian
cities, struck in imperial times, the city is represented by a turreted
female figure seated on rocks, and resting her feet on the shoulder of a
youthful male figure, who looks up in her face, stretching out his arms,
and who is sunk in the ground as high as the waist.See Mueller
(Denkmaeler d. A. Kunst, i., taf.220) for a group of this kind
in the Vatican, and several similar designs on coins.On the column of Trajan there occur many rude representations of the
Danube, and other rivers crossed by the Romans in their military
expeditions.The water is imitated by sculptured wavy lines, in which
boats are placed.In one scene (Bartoli, Colonna Trajana, Tav.4) this
rude conventional imitation is combined with a figure.In a recess in
the river bank is a reclining river-god, terminating at the waist.This
is either meant for a statue which was really placed on the bank of the
river, and which therefore marks some particular locality, or we have
here figurative representation blended with conventional imitation.On the column of Antoninus (Bartoli, Colon.15) a storm of
rain is represented by the head of Jupiter Pluvius, who has a vast
outspread beard flowing in long tresses.In the Townley collection, in
the British Museum, is a Roman helmet found at Ribchester in Lancashire,
with a mask or vizor attached.The helmet is richly embossed with
figures in a battle scene; round the brow is a row of turrets; the hair
in the forehead is so treated as to give the idea of waves washing the
base of the turrets.This head is perhaps a figurative representation of
a town girt with fortifications and a moat, near which some great battle
was fought.It is engraved (Vetusta Monum.In the Galeria at Florence is a group in alto relievo (Gori, Inscript.14) of three female figures, one of whom is
certainly Demeter Kourotrophos, or the earth; another, Thetis, or the
sea; the centre of the three seems to represent Aphrodite associated, as
on the coins of Camarina, with the element of fresh water.This figure is seated on a swan, and holds over her head an arched veil.Her hair is bound with reeds; above her veil grows a tall water plant,
and below the swan other water plants, and a stork seated on a _hydria_,
or pitcher, from which water is flowing.The swan, the stork, the water
plants, and the _hydria_ must all be regarded as symbols of fresh water,
the latter emblem being introduced to show that the element is fit for
the use of man.Fountains in Roman art are generally personified as figures of nymphs
reclining with urns, or standing holding before them a large shell.One of the latest representations of water in ancient art is the mosaic
of Palestrina (Barthelemy, in Bartoli, Peint.Antiques) which may be
described as a kind of rude panorama of some district of Upper Egypt, a
bird's-eye view, half man, half picture, in which the details are
neither adjusted to a scale, nor drawn according to perspective, but
crowded together, as they would be in an ancient bas-relief.I do not mean what I have here said of the Inventive power of the Arab
to be understood as in the least applying to the detestable
ornamentation of the Alhambra.[105] The Alhambra is no more
characteristic of Arab work, than Milan Cathedral is of Gothic: it is a
late building, a work of the Spanish dynasty in its last decline, and
its ornamentation is fit for nothing but to be transferred to patterns
of carpets or bindings of books, together with their marbling, and
mottling, and other mechanical recommendations.The Alhambra ornament
has of late been largely used in shop-fronts, to the no small detriment
of Regent Street and Oxford Street.LXXII., be the original angle of the wall.Inscribe
within it a circle, _p_ Q N _p_, of the size of the bead required,
touching A B, A C, in _p_, _p_; join _p_, _p_, and draw B C parallel to
it, touching the circle.Then the lines B C, _p p_ are the limits of the possible chamfers
constructed with curves struck either from centre A, as the line Q _q_,
N _d_, _r u_, _g c_, &c., or from any other point chosen as a centre in
the direction Q A produced: and also of all chamfers in straight lines,
as _a b_, _e f_.There are, of course, an infinite number of chamfers to
be struck between B C and _p p_, from every point in Q A produced to
infinity; thus we have infinity multiplied into infinity to express the
number of possible chamfers of this species, which are peculiarly
Italian chamfers; together with another singly infinite group of the
straight chamfers, _a b_, _e f_, &c., of which the one formed by the
line _a b_, passing through the centre of the circle, is the universal
early Gothic chamfer of Venice.Either on the line A C, or on any other lines A _l_ or A _m_,
radiating from A, any number of centres may be taken, from which, with
any radii not greater than the distance between such points and Q, an
infinite number of curves may be struck, such as _t u_, _r s_, N _n_
(all which are here struck from centres on the line A C).These lines
represent the great class of the northern chamfers, of which the number
is infinity raised to its fourth power, but of which the curve N _n_
(for northern) represents the average condition; the shallower chamfers
of the same group, _r s_, _t u_, &c., occurring often in Italy.The
lines _r u_, _t u_, and _a b_ may be taken approximating to the most
frequent conditions of the southern chamfer.It is evident that the chords of any of these curves will give a
relative group of rectilinear chamfers, occurring both in the North and
South; but the rectilinear chamfers, I think, invariably fall within the
line Q C, and are either parallel with it, or inclined to A C at an
angle greater than A C Q, and often perpendicular to it; but never
inclined to it at an angle less than A C Q.The following extract from my note-book refers also to some features of
late decoration of shafts."The Scuola di San Rocco is one of the most interesting examples of
Renaissance work in Venice.Its fluted pillars are surrounded each by a
wreath, one of vine, another of laurel, another of oak, not indeed
arranged with the fantasticism of early Gothic; but, especially the
laurel, reminding one strongly of the laurel sprays, powerful as well as
beautiful, of Veronese and Tintoret.Their stems are curiously and
richly interlaced--the last vestige of the Byzantine wreathed work--and
the vine-leaves are ribbed on the surfaces, I think, nearly as finely as
those of the Noah,[106] though more injured by time.The capitals are
far the richest Renaissance in Venice, less corrupt and more masculine
in plan, than any other, and truly suggestive of support, though of
course showing the tendency to error in this respect; and finally, at
the angles of the pure Attic bases, on the square plinth, are set
couchant animals; one, an elephant four inches high, very curiously and
cleverly cut, and all these details worked with a spirit, finish, fancy,
and affection quite worthy of the middle ages.But they have all the
marked fault of being utterly detached from the architecture.The
wreaths round the columns look as if they would drop off the next
moment, and the animals at the bases produce exactly the effect of mice
who had got there by accident: one feels them ridiculously diminutive,
and utterly useless."The effect of diminutiveness is, I think, chiefly owing to there being
no other groups of figures near them, to accustom the eye to the
proportion, and to the needless choice of the largest animals,
elephants, bears, and lions, to occupy a position so completely
insignificant, and to be expressed on so contemptible a scale,--not in a
bas-relief or pictorial piece of sculpture, but as independent figures.The whole building is a most curious illustration of the appointed fate
of the Renaissance architects,--to caricature whatever they imitated,
and misapply whatever they learned.ROMANIST DECORATION OF BASES.I have spoken above (Appendix 12) of the way in which the Roman Catholic
priests everywhere suffer their churches to be desecrated.But the worst
instances I ever saw of sacrilege and brutality, daily permitted in the
face of all men, were the uses to which the noble base of St.Mark's was
put, when I was last in Venice.Portions of nearly all cathedrals may be
found abandoned to neglect; but this base of St.Full fronting the western sun--crossing the whole breadth of
St.Mark's Place--the termination of the most noble square in the
world--the centre of the most noble city--its purple marbles were, in
the winter of 1849, the customary _gambling tables_ of the idle children
of Venice; and the parts which flank the Great Entrance, that very
entrance where "Barbarossa flung his mantle off," were the counters of a
common bazaar for children's toys, carts, dolls, and small pewter spoons
and dishes, German caricatures and books of the Opera, mixed with those
of the offices of religion; the caricatures being fastened with twine
round the porphyry shafts of the church.One Sunday, the 24th of
February, 1850, the book-stall being somewhat more richly laid out than
usual, I noted down the titles of a few of the books in the order in
which they lay, and I give them below.The irony conveyed by the
juxtaposition of the three in Italics appears too shrewd to be
accidental; but the fact was actually so.Along the edge of the white plinth were a row of two kinds of books,

  Officium Beatae Virg.M.; and Officium Hebdomadae sanctae, juxta Formam
    Missalis et Breviarii Romani sub Urbano VIII.Behind these lay, side by side, the following:

  Don Desiderio.Dramma Giocoso per Musica.Breve Esposizione della Carattere di vera Religione.On the top of this latter, keeping its leaves open,

  La Figlia del Reggimento._Carteggio di Madama la Marchesa di Pompadour, ossia
     raccolta di Lettere scritte della Medesima._
  _Istruzioni di morale Condotta per le Figlie._
  _Francesca di Rimini.Dramma per Musica._

Then, a little farther on, after a mass of plays:--

  Orazioni a Gesu Nazareno e a Maria addolorata.Semiramide; Melodramma tragico da rappresentarsi nel Gran Teatro
    il Fenice.Modo di orare per l'Acquisto del S. Giubileo, conceduto a tutto il
    Mondo Cattolico da S. S. Gregorio XVI.Le due illustre Rivali, Melodramma in Tre Atti, da rappresentarsi
    nel nuovo Gran Teatro il Fenice.Il Cristiano secondo il Cuore di Gesu, per la Pratica delle sue
    Virtu.Traduzione dell'Idioma Italiana.La chiava Chinese; Commedia del Sig.La Pelarina; Intermezzo de Tre Parti per Musica.Il Cavaliero e la Dama; Commedia in Tre Atti in Prosa.But this being the last piece of
Appendix I have to add to the present volume, I would desire to close
its pages with a question to my readers--a statistical question, which,
I doubt not, is being accurately determined for us all elsewhere, and
which, therefore, it seems to me, our time would not be wasted in
determining for ourselves.There has now been peace between England and the continental powers
about thirty-five years, and during that period the English have visited
the continent at the rate of many thousands a year, staying there, I
suppose, on the average, each two or three months; nor these an inferior
kind of English, but the kind which ought to be the best--the noblest
born, the best taught, the richest in time and money, having more
leisure, knowledge, and power than any other portion of the nation.These, we might suppose, beholding, as they travelled, the condition of
the states in which the Papal religion is professed, and being, at the
same time, the most enlightened section of a great Protestant nation,
would have been animated with some desire to dissipate the Romanist
errors, and to communicate to others the better knowledge which they
possessed themselves.I doubt not but that He who gave peace upon the
earth, and gave it by the hand of England, expected this much of her,
and has watched every one of the millions of her travellers as they
crossed the sea, and kept count for him of his travelling expenses, and
of their distribution, in a manner of which neither the traveller nor
his courier were at all informed.I doubt not, I say, but that such
accounts have been literally kept for all of us, and that a day will
come when they will be made clearly legible to us, and when we shall see
added together, on one side of the account book, a great sum, the
certain portion, whatever it may be, of this thirty-five years'
spendings of the rich English, accounted for in this manner:--

To wooden spoons, nut-crackers, and jewellery, bought at Geneva, and
elsewhere among the Alps, so much; to shell cameos and bits of mosaic
bought at Rome, so much; to coral horns and lava brooches bought at
Naples, so much; to glass beads at Venice, and gold filigree at Genoa,
so much; to pictures, and statues, and ornaments, everywhere, so much;
to avant-couriers and extra post-horses, for show and magnificence, so
much; to great entertainments and good places for seeing sights, so
much; to ball-dresses and general vanities, so much.This, I say, will
be the sum on one side of the book; and on the other will be written:

To the struggling Protestant Churches of France, Switzerland, and
Piedmont, so much.Had we not better do this piece of statistics for ourselves, in time?FOOTNOTES:

  [93] Ed.[95] L'Artiste en Batiments, par Louis Berteaux: Dijon, 1848.My
    printer writes at the side of the page a note, which I insert with
    thanks:--"This is not the first attempt at a French order.The
    writer has a Treatise by Sebastian Le Clerc, a great man in his
    generation, which contains a Roman order, a Spanish order, which the
    inventor appears to think very grand, and a _new_ French order
    nationalised by the Gallic cock crowing and clapping its wings in
    the capital."[96] The lower group in Plate XVII.[97] One of the upper stories is also in Gally Knight's plate
    represented as merely banded, and otherwise plain: it is, in
    reality, covered with as delicate inlaying as the rest.The whole
    front is besides out of proportion, and out of perspective, at once;
    and yet this work is referred to as of authority, by our architects.Well may our architecture fall from its place among the fine arts,
    as it is doing rapidly; nearly all our works of value being devoted
    to the Greek architecture, which is _utterly useless_ to us--or
    worse._One_ most noble book, however, has been dedicated to our
    English abbeys,--Mr.E. Sharpe's "Architectural Parallels"--almost a
    model of what I should like to see done for the Gothic of all
    Europe.[98] Except in the single passage "tell it unto the Church," which
    is simply the _extension_ of what had been commanded before, i.e.,
    tell the fault first "between thee and him," then taking "with thee
    one or two more," then, to all Christian men capable of hearing the
    cause: if he refuse to hear their common voice, "let him be unto
    thee as a heathen man and publican:" (But consider how Christ
    treated both.)[99] One or two remarks on this subject, some of which I had
    intended to have inserted here, and others in Appendix 5, I have
    arranged in more consistent order, and published in a separate
    pamphlet, "Notes on the Construction of Sheep-folds," for the
    convenience of readers interested in other architecture than that of
    Venetian palaces.[100] Not, however, by Johnson's _testimony_: Vide Adventurer, No."Such operations as required neither celerity nor strength,--the
    low drudgery of collating copies, comparing authorities, _digesting
    dictionaries_, or accumulating compilations."[101] We have done so--theoretically; just as one would reason on
    the human form from the bones outwards: but the Architect of human
    form frames all at once--bone and flesh.[102] Of course mere multiplicability, as of an engraving, does not
    diminish the intrinsic value of the work; and if the casts of
    sculpture could be as sharp as the sculpture itself, they would hold
    to it the relation of value which engravings hold to paintings.And,
    if we choose to have our churches all alike, we might cast them all
    in bronze--we might actually coin churches, and have mints of
    Cathedrals.It would be worthy of the spirit of the century to put
    milled edges for mouldings, and have a popular currency of religious
    subjects: a new cast of nativities every Christmas.I have not heard
    this contemplated, however, and I speak, therefore, only of the
    results which I believe are contemplated, as attainable by mere
    mechanical applications of glass and iron.[103] I shall often have occasion to write measures in the current
    text, therefore the reader will kindly understand that whenever they
    are thus written, 2,, 2, with double commas between, the first
    figures stand for English feet, the second for English inches.[104] I cannot suffer this volume to close without also thanking my
    kind friend, Mr.Rawdon Brown, for help given me in a thousand ways
    during my stay in Venice: but chiefly for his direction to passages
    elucidatory of my subject in the MSS.[105] I have not seen the building itself, but Mr.Owen Jones's work
    may, I suppose, be considered as sufficiently representing it for
    all purposes of criticism.[106] The sculpture of the Drunkenness of Noah on the Ducal Palace,

through a period of calculated neglect, and then began to return to
the apartment more regularly.In spite of all its drawbacks, it was a
place of quiet, peace, and very notable personal comfort.During the first days of Lester's return it was difficult for
Jennie to adjust matters so as to keep the playful, nervous, almost
uncontrollable child from annoying the staid, emphatic,
commercial-minded man.Jennie gave Vesta a severe talking to the first
night Lester telephoned that he was coming, telling her that he was a
very bad-tempered man who didn't like children, and that she mustn't
go near him."You mustn't talk," she said.Let mamma ask you what you want.Vesta agreed solemnly, but her childish mind hardly grasped the
full significance of the warning.Jennie, who had taken great pains to array
Vesta as attractively as possible, had gone into her bedroom to give
her own toilet a last touch.As a
matter of fact, she had followed her mother to the door of the
sitting-room, where now she could be plainly seen.Lester hung up his
hat and coat, then, turning, he caught his first glimpse.The child
looked very sweet--he admitted that at a glance.She was arrayed
in a blue-dotted, white flannel dress, with a soft roll collar and
cuffs, and the costume was completed by white stockings and shoes.Her
corn-colored ringlets hung gaily about her face.Blue eyes, rosy lips,
rosy cheeks completed the picture.Lester stared, almost inclined to
say something, but restrained himself.When Jennie came out he commented on the fact that Vesta had
arrived."Rather sweet-looking child," he said."Do you have much
trouble in making her mind?"Jennie went on to the dining-room, and Lester overheard a scrap of
their conversation.Didn't I tell you you mustn't
talk?"What might have followed if the child had been homely, misshapen,
peevish, or all three, can scarcely be conjectured.Had Jennie been
less tactful, even in the beginning, he might have obtained a
disagreeable impression.As it was, the natural beauty of the child,
combined with the mother's gentle diplomacy in keeping her in the
background, served to give him that fleeting glimpse of innocence and
youth which is always pleasant.The thought struck him that Jennie had
been the mother of a child all these years; she had been separated
from it for months at a time; she had never even hinted at its
existence, and yet her affection for Vesta was obviously great."It's
queer," he said.One morning Lester was sitting in the parlor reading his paper when
he thought he heard something stir.He turned, and was surprised to
see a large blue eye fixed upon him through the crack of a neighboring
door--the effect was most disconcerting.It was not like the
ordinary eye, which, under such embarrassing circumstances, would have
been immediately withdrawn; it kept its position with deliberate
boldness.He turned his paper solemnly and looked again.He crossed his
legs and looked again.This little episode, unimportant in itself, was yet informed with
the saving grace of comedy, a thing to which Lester was especially
responsive.Although not in the least inclined to relax his attitude
of aloofness, he found his mind, in the minutest degree, tickled by
the mysterious appearance; the corners of his mouth were animated by a
desire to turn up.He did not give way to the feeling, and stuck by
his paper, but the incident remained very clearly in his mind.The
young wayfarer had made her first really important impression upon
him.Not long after this Lester was sitting one morning at breakfast,
calmly eating his chop and conning his newspaper, when he was aroused
by another visitation--this time not quite so simple.Jennie had
given Vesta her breakfast, and set her to amuse herself alone until
Lester should leave the house.Jennie was seated at the table, pouring
out the coffee, when Vesta suddenly appeared, very business-like in
manner, and marched through the room.Lester looked up, and Jennie
colored and arose.By this time, however, Vesta had reached the kitchen, secured a
little broom, and returned, a droll determination lighting her
face."I want my little broom," she exclaimed and marched sedately past,
at which manifestation of spirit Lester again twitched internally,
this time allowing the slightest suggestion of a smile to play across
his mouth.The final effect of this intercourse was gradually to break down
the feeling of distaste Lester had for the child, and to establish in
its place a sort of tolerant recognition of her possibilities as a
human being.The developments of the next six months were of a kind to further
relax the strain of opposition which still existed in Lester's mind.Although not at all resigned to the somewhat tainted atmosphere in
which he was living, he yet found himself so comfortable that he could
not persuade himself to give it up.It was too much like a bed of
down.The condition of unquestioned
liberty, so far as all his old social relationships were concerned,
coupled with the privilege of quiet, simplicity, and affection in the
home was too inviting.He lingered on, and began to feel that perhaps
it would be just as well to let matters rest as they were.During this period his friendly relations with the little Vesta
insensibly strengthened.He discovered that there was a real flavor of
humor about Vesta's doings, and so came to watch for its development.She was forever doing something interesting, and although Jennie
watched over her with a care that was in itself a revelation to him,
nevertheless Vesta managed to elude every effort to suppress her and
came straight home with her remarks.Once, for example, she was sawing
away at a small piece of meat upon her large plate with her big knife,
when Lester remarked to Jennie that it might be advisable to get her a
little breakfast set.Jennie, who never could tell what was to follow,
reached over and put it down, while Lester with difficulty restrained
a desire to laugh.Another morning, not long after, she was watching Jennie put the
lumps of sugar in Lester's cup, when she broke in with, "I want two
lumps in mine, mamma.""No, dearest," replied Jennie, "you don't need any in yours."Uncle Lester has two," she protested."Yes," returned Jennie; "but you're only a little girl.Besides you
mustn't say anything like that at the table."Uncle Lester eats too much sugar," was her immediate rejoinder, at
which that fine gourmet smiled broadly."I don't know about that," he put in, for the first time deigning
to answer her directly."That sounds like the fox and grapes to me."Vesta smiled back at him, and now that the ice was broken she
chattered on unrestrainedly.One thing led to another, and at last
Lester felt as though, in a way, the little girl belonged to him; he
was willing even that she should share in such opportunities as his
position and wealth might make possible--provided, of course,
that he stayed with Jennie, and that they worked out some arrangement
which would not put him hopelessly out of touch with the world which
was back of him, and which he had to keep constantly in mind.CHAPTER XXXII


The following spring the show-rooms and warehouse were completed,
and Lester removed his office to the new building.Heretofore, he had
been transacting all his business affairs at the Grand Pacific and the
club.From now on he felt himself to be firmly established in
Chicago--as if that was to be his future home.A large number of
details were thrown upon him--the control of a considerable
office force, and the handling of various important transactions.It
took away from him the need of traveling, that duty going to Amy's
husband, under the direction of Robert.The latter was doing his best
to push his personal interests, not only through the influence he was
bringing to bear upon his sisters, but through his reorganization of
the factory.Several men whom Lester was personally fond of were in
danger of elimination.But Lester did not hear of this, and Kane
senior was inclined to give Robert a free hand.He was glad to see some one with a strong policy come up and take
charge.Apparently he and Robert were on
better terms than ever before.Matters might have gone on smoothly enough were it not for the fact
that Lester's private life with Jennie was not a matter which could be
permanently kept under cover.At times he was seen driving with her by
people who knew him in a social and commercial way.He was for
brazening it out on the ground that he was a single man, and at
liberty to associate with anybody he pleased.Jennie might be any
young woman of good family in whom he was interested.He did not
propose to introduce her to anybody if he could help it, and he always
made it a point to be a fast traveler in driving, in order that others
might not attempt to detain and talk to him.At the theater, as has
been said, she was simply "Miss Gerhardt."The trouble was that many of his friends were also keen observers
of life.They had no quarrel to pick with Lester's conduct.Only he
had been seen in other cities, in times past, with this same woman.She must be some one whom he was maintaining irregularly.Wealth and youthful spirits must have their fling.Rumors came
to Robert, who, however, kept his own counsel.If Lester wanted to do
this sort of thing, well and good.But there must come a time when
there would be a show-down.This came about in one form about a year and a half after Lester
and Jennie had been living in the north side apartment.It so happened
that, during a stretch of inclement weather in the fall, Lester was
seized with a mild form of grip.When he felt the first symptoms he
thought that his indisposition would be a matter of short duration,
and tried to overcome it by taking a hot bath and a liberal dose of
quinine.But the infection was stronger than he counted on; by morning
he was flat on his back, with a severe fever and a splitting
headache.His long period of association with Jennie had made him incautious.Policy would have dictated that he should betake himself to his hotel
and endure his sickness alone.As a matter of fact, he was very glad
to be in the house with her.He had to call up the office to say that
he was indisposed and would not be down for a day or so; then he
yielded himself comfortably to her patient ministrations.Jennie, of course, was delighted to have Lester with her, sick or
well.She persuaded him to see a doctor and have him prescribe.She
brought him potions of hot lemonade, and bathed his face and hands in
cold water over and over.Later, when he was recovering, she made him
appetizing cups of beef-tea or gruel.It was during this illness that the first real contretemps
occurred.Lester's sister Louise, who had been visiting friends in St.Paul, and who had written him that she might stop off to see him on
her way, decided upon an earlier return than she had originally
planned.While Lester was sick at his apartment she arrived in
Chicago.Calling up the office, and finding that he was not there and
would not be down for several days, she asked where he could be
reached."I think he is at his rooms in the Grand Pacific," said an
incautious secretary.Louise, a little
disturbed, telephoned to the Grand Pacific, and was told that Mr.Kane
had not been there for several days--did not, as a matter of
fact, occupy his rooms more than one or two days a week.Piqued by
this, she telephoned his club.It so happened that at the club there was a telephone boy who had
called up the apartment a number of times for Lester himself.He had
not been cautioned not to give its number--as a matter of fact,
it had never been asked for by any one else.When Louise stated that
she was Lester's sister, and was anxious to find him, the boy replied,
"I think he lives at 19 Schiller Place.""Whose address is that you're giving?""Well, don't be giving out addresses.The boy apologized, but Louise had hung up the receiver and was
gone.About an hour later, curious as to this third residence of her
brother, Louise arrived at Schiller Place.Ascending the
steps--it was a two-apartment house--she saw the name of
Kane on the door leading to the second floor.Ringing the bell, she
was opened to by Jennie, who was surprised to see so fashionably
attired a young woman.Kane's apartment, I believe," began Louise,
condescendingly, as she looked in at the open door behind Jennie.She
was a little surprised to meet a young woman, but her suspicions were
as yet only vaguely aroused.Jennie, had she had time to collect her thoughts, would have tried
to make some excuse, but Louise, with the audacity of her birth and
station, swept past before Jennie could say a word.Once inside Louise
looked about her inquiringly.She found herself in the sitting-room,
which gave into the bedroom where Lester was lying.Vesta happened to
be playing in one corner of the room, and stood up to eye the
new-comer.The open bedroom showed Lester quite plainly lying in bed,
a window to the left of him, his eyes closed."Oh, there you are, old fellow!"Lester, who at the sound of her voice had opened his eyes, realized
in an instant how things were.He pulled himself up on one elbow, but
words failed him."Why, hello, Louise," he finally forced himself to say.I came back sooner than I thought," she answered lamely,
a sense of something wrong irritating her."I had a hard time finding
you, too.Who's your--" she was about to say "pretty
housekeeper," but turned to find Jennie dazedly gathering up certain
articles in the adjoining room and looking dreadfully distraught.His sister swept the place with an observing eye.It took in the
home atmosphere, which was both pleasing and suggestive.There was a
dress of Jennie's lying across a chair, in a familiar way, which
caused Miss Kane to draw herself up warily.She looked at her brother,
who had a rather curious expression in his eyes--he seemed
slightly nonplussed, but cool and defiant."You shouldn't have come out here," said Lester finally, before
Louise could give vent to the rising question in her mind."You're my brother, aren't you?Why should you have any place that I
couldn't come.Well, I like that--and from you to me.""Listen, Louise," went on Lester, drawing himself up further on one
elbow."You know as much about life as I do.There is no need of our
getting into an argument.I didn't know you were coming, or I would
have made other arrangements.""Other arrangements, indeed," she sneered.She was greatly irritated to think that she had fallen into this
trap; it was really disgraceful of Lester."I wouldn't be so haughty about it," he declared, his color rising."I'm not apologizing to you for my conduct.I'm saying I would have
made other arrangements, which is a very different thing from begging
your pardon.If you don't want to be civil, you needn't.""I thought
better of you, honestly I did.I should think you would be ashamed of
yourself living here in open--" she paused without using the
word--"and our friends scattered all over the city.I thought you had more sense of decency and
consideration.""I tell you I'm not apologizing to
you.If you don't like this you know what you can do."she demanded, savagely and yet
curiously.If it were it wouldn't make any
difference.I wish you wouldn't busy yourself about my affairs."Jennie, who had been moving about the dining-room beyond the
sitting-room, heard the cutting references to herself.I won't any more," retorted Louise."I
should think, though, that you, of all men, would be above anything
like this--and that with a woman so obviously beneath you.Why, I
thought she was--" she was again going to add "your housekeeper,"
but she was interrupted by Lester, who was angry to the point of
brutality."Never mind what you thought she was," he growled."She's better
than some who do the so-called superior thinking.It's neither here nor there, I tell you.I'm doing this, and I
don't care what you think."Well, I won't, I assure you," she flung back."It's quite plain
that your family means nothing to you.But if you had any sense of
decency, Lester Kane, you would never let your sister be trapped into
coming into a place like this.I'm disgusted, that's all, and so will
the others be when they hear of it."She turned on her heel and walked scornfully out, a withering look
being reserved for Jennie, who had unfortunately stepped near the door
of the dining-room.Jennie came in a little
while later and closed the door.Lester,
his thick hair pushed back from his vigorous face, leaned back moodily
on his pillow."What a devilish trick of fortune," he thought.Now she
would go home and tell it to the family.His father would know, and
his mother.Robert, Imogene, Amy all would hear.He would have no
explanation to make--she had seen.Meanwhile Jennie, moving about her duties, also found food for
reflection.So this was her real position in another woman's eyes.Now
she could see what the world thought.This family was as aloof from
her as if it lived on another planet.To his sisters and brothers, his
father and mother, she was a bad woman, a creature far beneath him
socially, far beneath him mentally and morally, a creature of the
streets.And she had hoped somehow to rehabilitate herself in the eyes
of the world.It cut her as nothing before had ever done.The thought
tore a great, gaping wound in her sensibilities.She was really low
and vile in her--Louise's--eyes, in the world's eyes,
basically so in Lester's eyes.She went
about numb and still, but the ache of defeat and disgrace was under it
all.Oh, if she could only see some way to make herself right with the
world, to live honorably, to be decent.How could that possibly be
brought about?CHAPTER XXXIII


Outraged in her family pride, Louise lost no time in returning to
Cincinnati, where she told the story of her discovery, embellished
with many details.According to her, she was met at the door by a
"silly-looking, white-faced woman," who did not even offer to invite
her in when she announced her name, but stood there "looking just as
guilty as a person possibly could."Lester also had acted shamefully,
having outbrazened the matter to her face.When she had demanded to
know whose the child was he had refused to tell her."It isn't mine,"
was all he would say.Kane, who was the first to hear
the story.exclaimed Louise emphatically, as though the
words needed to be reiterated to give them any shadow of reality."I went there solely because I thought I could help him," continued
Louise."I thought when they said he was indisposed that he might be
seriously ill."To think he would come to
anything like that!"Kane turned the difficult problem over in her mind and, having
no previous experiences whereby to measure it, telephoned for old
Archibald, who came out from the factory and sat through the
discussion with a solemn countenance.So Lester was living openly with
a woman of whom they had never heard.He would probably be as defiant
and indifferent as his nature was strong.The standpoint of parental
authority was impossible.Lester was a centralized authority in
himself, and if any overtures for a change of conduct were to be made,
they would have to be very diplomatically executed.Archibald Kane returned to the manufactory sore and disgusted, but
determined that something ought to be done.He held a consultation
with Robert, who confessed that he had heard disturbing rumors from
time to time, but had not wanted to say anything.Kane suggested
that Robert might go to Chicago and have a talk with Lester."He ought to see that this thing, if continued, is going to do him
irreparable damage," said Mr."He cannot hope to carry it off
successfully.He ought to marry her or he ought to quit.I
want you to tell him that for me.""All well and good," said Robert, "but who's going to convince him?I'm sure I don't want the job.""I hope to," said old Archibald, "eventually; but you'd better go
up and try, anyhow."I don't believe it," replied Robert.You see
how much good talk does down here.Still, I'll go if it will relieve
your feelings any."Yes, yes," said his father distractedly, "better go."Without allowing himself to anticipate any
particular measure of success in this adventure, he rode pleasantly
into Chicago confident in the reflection that he had all the powers of
morality and justice on his side.Upon Robert's arrival, the third morning after Louise's interview,
he called up the warerooms, but Lester was not there.He then
telephoned to the house, and tactfully made an appointment.Lester was
still indisposed, but he preferred to come down to the office, and he
did.He met Robert in his cheerful, nonchalant way, and together they
talked business for a time."Well, I suppose you know what brought me up here," began Robert
tentatively."I think I could make a guess at it," Lester replied."They were all very much worried over the fact that you were
sick--mother particularly.You're not in any danger of having a
relapse, are you?""Louise said there was some sort of a peculiar menage
she ran into up here."The young woman Louise saw is just--" Robert waved his hand
expressively."I don't want to be inquisitive, Lester.I'm simply here because the family felt that I ought to come.Mother
was so very much distressed that I couldn't do less than see you for
her sake"--he paused, and Lester, touched by the fairness and
respect of his attitude, felt that mere courtesy at least made some
explanation due."I don't know that anything I can say will help matters much," he
replied thoughtfully.I have the
woman and the family has its objections.The chief difficulty about
the thing seems to be the bad luck in being found out."He stopped, and Robert turned over the substance of this worldly
reasoning in his mind.He seemed, as
usual, to be most convincingly sane."You're not contemplating marrying her, are you?""I hadn't come to that," answered Lester coolly.They looked at each other quietly for a moment, and then Robert
turned his glance to the distant scene of the city."It's useless to ask whether you are seriously in love with her, I
suppose," ventured Robert."I don't know whether I'd be able to discuss that divine afflatus
with you or not," returned Lester, with a touch of grim humor."I have
never experienced the sensation myself.All I know is that the lady is
very pleasing to me.""Well, it's all a question of your own well-being and the family's,
Lester," went on Robert, after another pause."Morality doesn't seem
to figure in it anyway--at least you and I can't discuss that
together.Your feelings on that score naturally relate to you alone.But the matter of your own personal welfare seems to me to be
substantial enough ground to base a plea on.The family's feelings and
pride are also fairly important.Father's the kind of a man who sets
more store by the honor of his family than most men.You know that as
well as I do, of course.""I know how father feels about it," returned Lester."The whole
business is as clear to me as it is to any of you, though off-hand I
don't see just what's to be done about it.These matters aren't always
of a day's growth, and they can't be settled in a day.To a certain extent I'm responsible that she is here.While I'm
not willing to go into details, there's always more in these affairs
than appears on the court calendar.""Of course I don't know what your relations with her have been,"
returned Robert, "and I'm not curious to know, but it does look like a
bit of injustice all around, don't you think--unless you intend
to marry her?"This last was put forth as a feeler."I might be willing to agree to that, too," was Lester's baffling
reply, "if anything were to be gained by it.The point is, the woman
is here, and the family is in possession of the fact.Now if there is
anything to be done I have to do it.There isn't anybody else who can
act for me in this matter."Lester lapsed into a silence, and Robert rose and paced the floor,
coming back after a time to say: "You say you haven't any idea of
marrying her--or rather you haven't come to it.It seems to me you would be making the mistake of your life,
from every point of view.I don't want to orate, but a man of your
position has so much to lose; you can't afford to do it.Aside from
family considerations, you have too much at stake.You'd be simply
throwing your life away--"

He paused, with his right hand held out before him, as was
customary when he was deeply in earnest, and Lester felt the candor
and simplicity of this appeal.He
was making an appeal to him, and this was somewhat different.The appeal passed without comment, however, and then Robert began
on a new tack, this time picturing old Archibald's fondness for Lester
and the hope he had always entertained that he would marry some
well-to-do Cincinnati girl, Catholic, if agreeable to him, but at
least worthy of his station.Kane felt the same way; surely
Lester must realize that."I know just how all of them feel about it," Lester interrupted at
last, "but I don't see that anything's to be done right now.""You mean that you don't think it would be policy for you to give
her up just at present?""I mean that she's been exceptionally good to me, and that I'm
morally under obligations to do the best I can by her.What that may
be, I can't tell.""Certainly not to turn her out bag and baggage if she has been
accustomed to live with me," replied Lester.Robert sat down again, as if he considered his recent appeal
futile."Can't family reasons persuade you to make some amicable
arrangements with her and let her go?""Not without due consideration of the matter; no.""You don't think you could hold out some hope that the thing will
end quickly--something that would give me a reasonable excuse for
softening down the pain of it to the family?""I would be perfectly willing to do anything which would take away
the edge of this thing for the family, but the truth's the truth, and
I can't see any room for equivocation between you and me.As I've said
before, these relationships are involved with things which make it
impossible to discuss them--unfair to me, unfair to the woman.No
one can see how they are to be handled, except the people that are in
them, and even they can't always see.I'd be a damned dog to stand up
here and give you my word to do anything except the best I can."Lester stopped, and now Robert rose and paced the floor again, only
to come back after a time and say, "You don't think there's anything
to be done just at present?""Very well, then, I expect I might as well be going.I don't know
that there's anything else we can talk about.""Won't you stay and take lunch with me?I think I might manage to
get down to the hotel if you'll stay.""I believe I can make that one
o'clock train for Cincinnati.They stood before each other now, Lester pale and rather flaccid,
Robert clear, wax-like, well-knit, and shrewd, and one could see the
difference time had already made.Robert was the clean, decisive man,
Lester the man of doubts.Robert was the spirit of business energy and
integrity embodied, Lester the spirit of commercial self-sufficiency,
looking at life with an uncertain eye.Together they made a striking
picture, which was none the less powerful for the thoughts that were
now running through their minds."Well," said the older brother, after a time, "I don't suppose
there is anything more I can say.I had hoped to make you feel just as
we do about this thing, but of course you are your own best judge of
this.If you don't see it now, nothing I could say would make you.It
strikes me as a very bad move on your part though."He said nothing, but his face expressed an
unchanged purpose.Robert turned for his hat, and they walked to the office door
together."I'll put the best face I can on it," said Robert, and walked
out.CHAPTER XXXIV


In this world of ours the activities of animal life seem to be
limited to a plane or circle, as if that were an inherent necessity to
the creatures of a planet which is perforce compelled to swing about
the sun.A fish, for instance, may not pass out of the circle of the
seas without courting annihilation; a bird may not enter the domain of
the fishes without paying for it dearly.From the parasites of the
flowers to the monsters of the jungle and the deep we see clearly the
circumscribed nature of their movements--the emphatic manner in
which life has limited them to a sphere; and we are content to note
the ludicrous and invariably fatal results which attend any effort on
their part to depart from their environment.In the case of man, however, the operation of this theory of
limitations has not as yet been so clearly observed.The laws
governing our social life are not so clearly understood as to permit
of a clear generalization.Still, the opinions, pleas, and judgments
of society serve as boundaries which are none the less real for being
intangible.When men or women err--that is, pass out from the
sphere in which they are accustomed to move--it is not as if the
bird had intruded itself into the water, or the wild animal into the
haunts of man.People may do
no more than elevate their eyebrows in astonishment, laugh
sarcastically, lift up their hands in protest.And yet so well defined
is the sphere of social activity that he who departs from it is
doomed.Born and bred in this environment, the individual is
practically unfitted for any other state.He is like a bird accustomed
to a certain density of atmosphere, and which cannot live comfortably
at either higher or lower level.Lester sat down in his easy-chair by the window after his brother
had gone and gazed ruminatively out over the flourishing city.Yonder
was spread out before him life with its concomitant phases of energy,
hope, prosperity, and pleasure, and here he was suddenly struck by a
wind of misfortune and blown aside for the time being--his
prospects and purposes dissipated.Could he continue as cheerily in
the paths he had hitherto pursued?Would not his relations with Jennie
be necessarily affected by this sudden tide of opposition?Was not his
own home now a thing of the past so far as his old easy-going
relationship was concerned?All the atmosphere of unstained affection
would be gone out of it now.That hearty look of approval which used
to dwell in his father's eye--would it be there any longer?Robert, his relations with the manufactory, everything that was a part
of his old life, had been affected by this sudden intrusion of
Louise."It's unfortunate," was all that he thought to himself, and
therewith turned from what he considered senseless brooding to the
consideration of what, if anything, was to be done."I'm thinking I'd take a run up to Mt.Clemens to-morrow, or
Thursday anyhow, if I feel strong enough," he said to Jennie after he
had returned."I'm not feeling as well as I might.He wanted to get off by himself and think.Jennie packed his
bag for him at the given time, and he departed, but he was in a
sullen, meditative mood.During the week that followed he had ample time to think it all
over, the result of his cogitations being that there was no need of
making a decisive move at present.A few weeks more, one way or the
other, could not make any practical difference.Neither Robert nor any
other member of the family was at all likely to seek another
conference with him.His business relations would necessarily go on as
usual, since they were coupled with the welfare of the manufactory;
certainly no attempt to coerce him would be attempted.But the
consciousness that he was at hopeless variance with his family weighed
upon him."Bad business," he meditated--"bad business."For the period of a whole year this unsatisfactory state of affairs
continued.Lester did not go home for six months; then an important
business conference demanding his presence, he appeared and carried it
off quite as though nothing important had happened.His mother kissed
him affectionately, if a little sadly; his father gave him his
customary greeting, a hearty handshake; Robert, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
concertedly, though without any verbal understanding, agreed to ignore
the one real issue.But the feeling of estrangement was there, and it
persisted.Hereafter his visits to Cincinnati were as few and far
between as he could possibly make them.CHAPTER XXXV


In the meantime Jennie had been going through a moral crisis of her
own.For the first time in her life, aside from the family attitude,
which had afflicted her greatly, she realized what the world thought
of her.She had yielded on two
occasions to the force of circumstances which might have been fought
out differently.If she did not
always have this haunting sense of fear!If she could only make up her
mind to do the right thing!She loved him, but she could leave him, and it would be better for
him.Probably her father would live with her if she went back to
Cleveland.He would honor her for at last taking a decent stand.Yet
the thought of leaving Lester was a terrible one to her--he had
been so good.As for her father, she was not sure whether he would
receive her or not.After the tragic visit of Louise she began to think of saving a
little money, laying it aside as best she could from her allowance.Lester was generous and she had been able to send home regularly
fifteen dollars a week to maintain the family--as much as they
had lived on before, without any help from the outside.She spent
twenty dollars to maintain the table, for Lester required the best of
everything--fruits, meats, desserts, liquors, and what not.The
rent was fifty-five dollars, with clothes and extras a varying sum.Lester gave her fifty dollars a week, but somehow it had all gone.She
thought how she might economize but this seemed wrong.Better go without taking anything, if she were going, was the
thought that came to her.She thought over this week after week, after the advent of Louise,
trying to nerve herself to the point where she could speak or act.Lester was consistently generous and kind, but she felt at times that
he himself might wish it.Since the
scene with Louise it seemed to her that he had been a little
different.If she could only say to him that she was not satisfied
with the way she was living, and then leave.But he himself had
plainly indicated after his discovery of Vesta that her feelings on
that score could not matter so very much to him, since he thought the
presence of the child would definitely interfere with his ever
marrying her.It was her presence he wanted on another basis.And he
was so forceful, she could not argue with him very well.She decided
if she went it would be best to write a letter and tell him why.Then
maybe when he knew how she felt he would forgive her and think nothing
more about it.The condition of the Gerhardt family was not improving.Since
Jennie had left Martha had married.After several years of teaching in
the public schools of Cleveland she had met a young architect, and
they were united after a short engagement.Martha had been always a
little ashamed of her family, and now, when this new life dawned, she
was anxious to keep the connection as slight as possible.She barely
notified the members of the family of the approaching
marriage--Jennie not at all--and to the actual ceremony she
invited only Bass and George.Gerhardt, Veronica, and William resented
the slight.She hoped that life would give her an
opportunity to pay her sister off.William, of course, did not mind
particularly.He was interested in the possibilities of becoming an
electrical engineer, a career which one of his school-teachers had
pointed out to him as being attractive and promising.Jennie heard of Martha's marriage after it was all over, a note
from Veronica giving her the main details.She was glad from one point
of view, but realized that her brothers and sisters were drifting away
from her.A little while after Martha's marriage Veronica and William went to
reside with George, a break which was brought about by the attitude of
Gerhardt himself.Ever since his wife's death and the departure of the
other children he had been subject to moods of profound gloom, from
which he was not easily aroused.Life, it seemed, was drawing to a
close for him, although he was only sixty-five years of age.The
earthly ambitions he had once cherished were gone forever.He saw
Sebastian, Martha, and George out in the world practically ignoring
him, contributing nothing at all to a home which should never have
taken a dollar from Jennie.They
objected to leaving school and going to work, apparently preferring to
live on money which Gerhardt had long since concluded was not being
come by honestly.He was now pretty well satisfied as to the true
relations of Jennie and Lester.At first he had believed them to be
married, but the way Lester had neglected Jennie for long periods, the
humbleness with which she ran at his beck and call, her fear of
telling him about Vesta--somehow it all pointed to the same
thing.Gerhardt had never had sight
of her marriage certificate.Since she was away she might have been
married, but he did not believe it.The real trouble was that Gerhardt had grown intensely morose and
crotchety, and it was becoming impossible for young people to live
with him.They resented the way in which
he took charge of the expenditures after Martha left.He accused them
of spending too much on clothes and amusements, he insisted that a
smaller house should be taken, and he regularly sequestered a part of
the money which Jennie sent, for what purpose they could hardly guess.As a matter of fact, Gerhardt was saving as much as possible in order
to repay Jennie eventually.He thought it was sinful to go on in this
way, and this was his one method, out side of his meager earnings, to
redeem himself.If his other children had acted rightly by him he felt
that he would not now be left in his old age the recipient of charity
from one, who, despite her other good qualities, was certainly not
leading a righteous life.It ended one winter month when George agreed to receive his
complaining brother and sister on condition that they should get
something to do.Gerhardt was nonplussed for a moment, but invited
them to take the furniture and go their way.His generosity shamed
them for the moment; they even tentatively invited him to come and
live with them, but this he would not do.He would ask the foreman of
the mill he watched for the privilege of sleeping in some
out-of-the-way garret.And this would
save him a little money.So in a fit of pique he did this, and there was seen the spectacle
of an old man watching through a dreary season of nights, in a lonely
trafficless neighborhood while the city pursued its gaiety elsewhere.He had a wee small corner in the topmost loft of a warehouse away from
the tear and grind of the factory proper.In the afternoon he would take a little walk, strolling toward the
business center, or out along the banks of the Cuyahoga, or the lake.As a rule his hands were below his back, his brow bent in meditation.He would even talk to himself a little--an occasional "By chops!"or "So it is" being indicative of his dreary mood.At dusk he would
return, taking his stand at the lonely gate which was his post of
duty.His meals he secured at a nearby workingmen's boarding-house,
such as he felt he must have.The nature of the old German's reflections at this time were of a
peculiarly subtle and somber character.What did it all come to after the struggle, and the
worry, and the grieving?People die; you hear
nothing more from them.Yet he continued to hold some strongly dogmatic convictions.He
believed there was a hell, and that people who sinned would go there.He believed that both had
sinned woefully.He believed that the just would be rewarded in
heaven.Sebastian
was a good boy, but he was cold, and certainly indifferent to his
father.Take Martha--she was ambitious, but obviously selfish.Somehow the children, outside of Jennie, seemed self-centered.Bass
walked off when he got married, and did nothing more for anybody.Martha insisted that she needed all she made to live on.George had
contributed for a little while, but had finally refused to help out.Veronica and William had been content to live on Jennie's money so
long as he would allow it, and yet they knew it was not right.His
very existence, was it not a commentary on the selfishness of his
children?Life was truly strange, and dark, and uncertain.Still he
did not want to go and live with any of his children.Actually they
were not worthy of him--none but Jennie, and she was not good.This woeful condition of affairs was not made known to Jennie for
some time.She had been sending her letters to Martha, but, on her
leaving, Jennie had been writing directly to Gerhardt.After
Veronica's departure Gerhardt wrote to Jennie saying that there was no
need of sending any more money.Veronica and William were going to
live with George.He himself had a good place in a factory, and would
live there a little while.He returned her a moderate sum that he had
saved--one hundred and fifteen dollars--with the word that
he would not need it.Jennie did not understand, but as the others did not write, she was
not sure but what it might be all right--her father was so
determined.But by degrees, however, a sense of what it really must
mean overtook her--a sense of something wrong, and she worried,
hesitating between leaving Lester and going to see about her father,
whether she left him or not.Yet if she did not get some work which paid well
they would have a difficult time.If she could get five
or six dollars a week they could live.This hundred and fifteen
dollars which Gerhardt had saved would tide them over the worst
difficulties perhaps.CHAPTER XXXVI


The trouble with Jennie's plan was that it did not definitely take
into consideration Lester's attitude.He did care for her in an
elemental way, but he was hedged about by the ideas of the
conventional world in which he had been reared.To say that he loved
her well enough to take her for better or worse--to legalize her
anomalous position and to face the world bravely with the fact that he
had chosen a wife who suited him--was perhaps going a little too
far, but he did really care for her, and he was not in a mood, at this
particular time, to contemplate parting with her for good.Lester was getting along to that time of life when his ideas of
womanhood were fixed and not subject to change.Thus far, on his own
plane and within the circle of his own associates, he had met no one
who appealed to him as did Jennie.She was gentle, intelligent,
gracious, a handmaiden to his every need; and he had taught her the
little customs of polite society, until she was as agreeable a
companion as he cared to have.He was comfortable, he was
satisfied--why seek further?But Jennie's restlessness increased day by day.She tried writing
out her views, and started a half dozen letters before she finally
worded one which seemed, partially at least, to express her feelings.It was a long letter for her, and it ran as follows:

"Lester dear, When you get this I won't be here, and I want you
not to think harshly of me until you have read it all.I am taking
Vesta and leaving, and I think it is really better that I should.You know when you met me we were very poor,
and my condition was such that I didn't think any good man would ever
want me.When you came along and told me you loved me I was hardly
able to think just what I ought to do.You made me love you, Lester,
in spite of myself."You know I told you that I oughtn't to do anything wrong any more
and that I wasn't good, but somehow when you were near me I couldn't
think just right, and I didn't see just how I was to get away from
you.Papa was sick at home that time, and there was hardly anything in
the house to eat.My brother George
didn't have good shoes, and mamma was so worried.I have often
thought, Lester, if mamma had not been compelled to worry so much she
might be alive to-day.I thought if you liked me and I really liked
you--I love you, Lester--maybe it wouldn't make so much
difference about me.You know you told me right away you would like to
help my family, and I felt that maybe that would be the right thing to
do."Lester, dear, I am ashamed to leave you this way; it seems so mean,
but if you knew how I have been feeling these days you would forgive
me.Oh, I love you, Lester, I do, I do.But for months past--ever
since your sister came--I felt that I was doing wrong, and that I
oughtn't to go on doing it, for I know how terribly wrong it is.It
was wrong for me ever to have anything to do with Senator Brander, but
I was such a girl then--I hardly knew what I was doing.It was
wrong of me not to tell you about Vesta when I first met you, though I
thought I was doing right when I did it.It was terribly wrong of me
to keep her here all that time concealed, Lester, but I was afraid of
you then--afraid of what you would say and do.When your sister
Louise came it all came over me somehow, clearly, and I have never
been able to think right about it since.It can't be right, Lester,
but I don't blame you."I don't ask you to marry me, Lester.I know how you feel about me
and how you feel about your family, and I don't think it would be
right.They would never want you to do it, and it isn't right that I
should ask you.At the same time I know I oughtn't to go on living
this way.Vesta is getting along where she understands everything.She
thinks you are her really truly uncle.I have thought of it all so
much.I have thought a number of times that I would try to talk to you
about it, but you frighten me when you get serious, and I don't seem
to be able to say what I want to.So I thought if I could just write
you this and then go you would understand.I know it's for the best for you and for
me.Please forgive me, Lester, please; and don't
think of me any more.But I love you--oh yes, I
do--and I will never be grateful enough for all you have done for
me.I wish you all the luck that can come to you."P. S. I expect to go to Cleveland with papa.It's best that you
shouldn't."She put this in an envelope, sealed it, and, having hidden it in
her bosom, for the time being, awaited the hour when she could
conveniently take her departure.It was several days before she could bring herself to the actual
execution of the plan, but one afternoon, Lester, having telephoned
that he would not be home for a day or two, she packed some necessary
garments for herself and Vesta in several trunks, and sent for an
expressman.She thought of telegraphing her father that she was
coming; but, seeing he had no home, she thought it would be just as
well to go and find him.George and Veronica had not taken all the
furniture.The major portion of it was in storage--so Gerhard t
had written.She might take that and furnish a little home or flat.She was ready for the end, waiting for the expressman, when the door
opened and in walked Lester.For some unforeseen reason he had changed his mind.He was not in
the least psychic or intuitional, but on this occasion his feelings
had served him a peculiar turn.He had thought of going for a day's
duck-shooting with some friends in the Kankakee Marshes south of
Chicago, but had finally changed his mind; he even decided to go out
to the house early.As he neared the house he felt a little peculiar about coming home
so early; then at the sight of the two trunks standing in the middle
of the room he stood dumfounded.What did it mean--Jennie dressed
and ready to depart?He stared in
amazement, his brown eyes keen in inquiry."Why--why--" she began, falling back."I thought I would go to Cleveland," she replied."Why--why--I meant to tell you, Lester, that I didn't
think I ought to stay here any longer this way.I thought I'd tell you, but I couldn't."What the deuce are you talking about?"There," she said, mechanically pointing to a small center-table
where the letter lay conspicuous on a large book."And you were really going to leave me, Jennie, with just a
letter?"said Lester, his voice hardening a little as he spoke."I
swear to heaven you are beyond me.He tore open the
envelope and looked at the beginning."Better send Vesta from the
room," he suggested.Then she came back and stood there pale and wide-eyed,
looking at the wall, at the trunks, and at him.He shifted his position once or twice, then dropped the
paper on the floor."Well, I'll tell you, Jennie," he said finally, looking at her
curiously and wondering just what he was going to say.Here again was
his chance to end this relationship if he wished.He couldn't feel
that he did wish it, seeing how peacefully things were running.They
had gone so far together it seemed ridiculous to quit now.He truly
loved her--there was no doubt of that.Still he did not want to
marry her--could not very well."You have this thing wrong," he went on slowly."I don't know
what comes over you at times, but you don't view the situation right.I've told you before that I can't marry you--not now, anyhow.There are too many big things involved in this, which you don't know
anything about.But my family has to be
taken into consideration, and the business.You can't see the
difficulties raised on these scores, but I can.Now I don't want you
to leave me.I can't prevent you, of
course.But I don't think you ought to want
to.Jennie, who had been counting on getting away without being seen,
was now thoroughly nonplussed.To have him begin a quiet
argument--a plea as it were.He, Lester, pleading
with her, and she loved him so.She went over to him, and he took her hand."There's really nothing to be gained by
your leaving me at present."Well, how did you expect to get along?""I thought I'd take papa, if he'd come with me--he's alone
now--and get something to do, maybe.""Well, what can you do, Jennie, different from what you ever have
done?You wouldn't expect to be a lady's maid again, would you?"I thought I might get some place as a housekeeper," she suggested.She had been counting up her possibilities, and this was the most
promising idea that had occurred to her."No, no," he grumbled, shaking his head.There's nothing in this whole move of yours except a notion.Why, you
won't be any better off morally than you are right now.It doesn't make any difference, anyhow.I might in the future, but I can't tell anything about that, and
I don't want to promise anything.You're not going to leave me though
with my consent, and if you were going I wouldn't have you dropping
back into any such thing as you're contemplating.I'll make some
provision for you.You don't really want to leave me, do you,
Jennie?"Against Lester's strong personality and vigorous protest Jennie's
own conclusions and decisions went to pieces.Just the pressure of his
hand was enough to upset her."Don't cry, Jennie," he said."This thing may work out better than
you think.You're not
going to leave me any more, are you?""Let things rest as they are," he went on.I'm putting up with some things myself that I ordinarily
wouldn't stand for."He finally saw her restored to comparative calmness, smiling sadly
through her tears."Now you put those things away," he said genially, pointing to the
trunks."Besides, I want you to promise me one thing.""No more concealment of anything, do you hear?No more thinking
things out for yourself, and acting without my knowing anything about
it.If you have anything on your mind, I want you to come out with it.I'll help you solve it, or, if I can't, at least there won't be any
concealment between us.""I know, Lester," she said earnestly, looking him straight in the
eyes."I promise I'll never conceal anything any more--truly I
won't.I've been afraid, but I won't be now."That sounds like what you ought to be," he replied.A few days later, and in consequence of this agreement, the future
of Gerhardt came up for discussion.Jennie had been worrying about him
for several days; now it occurred to her that this was something to
talk over with Lester.Accordingly, she explained one night at dinner
what had happened in Cleveland."I know he is very unhappy there all
alone," she said, "and I hate to think of it.I was going to get him
if I went back to Cleveland.Now I don't know what to do about
it.""Why don't you send him some money?""He won't take any more money from me, Lester," she explained."He
thinks I'm not good--not acting right."He has pretty good reason, hasn't he?""I hate to think of him sleeping in a factory.He's so old and
lonely.""What's the matter with the rest of the family in Cleveland?Won't
they do anything for him?"I think maybe they don't want him, he's so cross," she said
simply."I hardly know what to suggest in that case," smiled Lester."The
old gentleman oughtn't to be so fussy.""I know," she said, "but he's old now, and he has had so much
trouble."Lester ruminated for a while, toying with his fork."I'll tell you
what I've been thinking, Jennie," he said finally."There's no use
living this way any longer, if we're going to stick it out.I've been
thinking that we might take a house out in Hyde Park.It's something
of a run from the office, but I'm not much for this apartment life.You and Vesta would be better off for a yard.In that case you might
bring your father on to live with us.He couldn't do any harm
pottering about; indeed, he might help keep things straight.""Oh, that would just suit papa, if he'd come," she replied."He
loves to fix things, and he'd cut the grass and look after the
furnace.But he won't come unless he's sure I'm married.""I don't know how that could be arranged unless you could show the
old gentleman a marriage certificate.He seems to want something that
can't be produced very well.A steady job he'd have running the
furnace of a country house," he added meditatively.Jennie did not notice the grimness of the jest.She was too busy
thinking what a tangle she had made of her life.Gerhardt would not
come now, even if they had a lovely home to share with him.And yet he
ought to be with Vesta again.She remained lost in a sad abstraction, until Lester, following the
drift of her thoughts, said: "I don't see how it can be arranged.Marriage certificate blanks aren't easily procurable.It's bad
business--a criminal offense to forge one, I believe.I wouldn't
want to be mixed up in that sort of thing.""Oh, I don't want you to do anything like that, Lester.I'm just
sorry papa is so stubborn.When he gets a notion you can't change
him.""Suppose we wait until we get settled after moving," he suggested."Then you can go to Cleveland and talk to him personally.It was
so decent that he rather wished he could help her carry out her
scheme.While not very interesting, Gerhardt was not objectionable to
Lester, and if the old man wanted to do the odd jobs around a big
place, why not?CHAPTER XXXVII


The plan for a residence in Hyde Park was not long in taking shape.After several weeks had passed, and things had quieted down again,
Lester invited Jennie to go with him to South Hyde Park to look for a
house.On the first trip they found something which seemed to suit
admirably--an old-time home of eleven large rooms, set in a lawn
fully two hundred feet square and shaded by trees which had been
planted when the city was young.It was ornate, homelike, peaceful.Jennie was fascinated by the sense of space and country, although
depressed by the reflection that she was not entering her new home
under the right auspices.She had vaguely hoped that in planning to go
away she was bringing about a condition under which Lester might have
come after her and married her.She had
promised to stay, and she would have to make the best of it.She
suggested that they would never know what to do with so much room, but
he waved that aside."We will very likely have people in now and
then," he said."We can furnish it up anyhow, and see how it looks."He had the agent make out a five-year lease, with an option for
renewal, and set at once the forces to work to put the establishment
in order.The house was painted and decorated, the lawn put in order, and
everything done to give the place a trim and satisfactory appearance.There was a large, comfortable library and sitting-room, a big
dining-room, a handsome reception-hall, a parlor, a large kitchen,
serving-room, and in fact all the ground-floor essentials of a
comfortable home.On the second floor were bedrooms, baths, and the
maid's room.It was all very comfortable and harmonious, and Jennie
took an immense pride and pleasure in getting things in order.Immediately after moving in, Jennie, with Lester's permission,
wrote to her father asking him to come to her.She did not say that
she was married, but left it to be inferred.She descanted on the
beauty of the neighborhood, the size of the yard, and the manifold
conveniences of the establishment."It is so very nice," she added,
"you would like it, papa.Vesta is here and goes to school every day.Won't you come and stay with us?It's so much better than living in a
factory.Gerhardt read this letter with a solemn countenance, Was it really
true?Would they be taking a larger house if they were not permanently
united?Well, it was high time--but should he go?He had lived
alone this long time now--should he go to Chicago and live with
Jennie?Her appeal did touch him, but somehow he decided against it.That would be too generous an acknowledgment of the fact that there
had been fault on his side as well as on hers.Jennie was disappointed at Gerhardt's refusal.She talked it over
with Lester, and decided that she would go on to Cleveland and see
him.Accordingly, she made the trip, hunted up the factory, a great
rumbling furniture concern in one of the poorest sections of the city,
and inquired at the office for her father.The clerk directed her to a
distant warehouse, and Gerhardt was informed that a lady wished to see
him.He crawled out of his humble cot and came down, curious as to who
it could be.When Jennie saw him in his dusty, baggy clothes, his hair
gray, his eye brows shaggy, coming out of the dark door, a keen sense
of the pathetic moved her again.He came
toward her, his inquisitorial eye softened a little by his
consciousness of the affection that had inspired her visit."I want you to come home with me, papa," she pleaded yearningly."I
don't want you to stay here any more.I can't think of you living
alone any longer.""So," he said, nonplussed, "that brings you?""Yes," she replied; "Won't you?"I have a good bed," he explained by way of apology for his
state."I know," she replied, "but we have a good home now and Vesta is
there."Yes," she replied, lying hopelessly."I have been married a long
time.She could scarcely look him
in the face, but she managed somehow, and he believed her."Well," he said, "it is time.""Won't you come, papa?"He threw out his hands after his characteristic manner.The urgency
of her appeal touched him to the quick."Yes, I come," he said, and
turned; but she saw by his shoulders what was happening.For answer he walked back into the dark warehouse to get his
things.CHAPTER XXXVIII


Gerhardt, having become an inmate of the Hyde Park home, at once
bestirred himself about the labors which he felt instinctively
concerned him.He took charge of the furnace and the yard, outraged at
the thought that good money should be paid to any outsider when he had
nothing to do.The trees, he declared to Jennie, were in a dreadful
condition.If Lester would get him a pruning knife and a saw he would
attend to them in the spring.In Germany they knew how to care for
such things, but these Americans were so shiftless.Then he wanted
tools and nails, and in time all the closets and shelves were put in
order.He found a Lutheran Church almost two miles away, and declared
that it was better than the one in Cleveland.The pastor, of course,
was a heaven-sent son of divinity.And nothing would do but that Vesta
must go to church with him regularly.Jennie and Lester settled down into the new order of living with
some misgivings; certain difficulties were sure to arise.On the North
Side it had been easy for Jennie to shun neighbors and say nothing.Now they were occupying a house of some pretensions; their immediate
neighbors would feel it their duty to call, and Jennie would have to
play the part of an experienced hostess.She and Lester had talked
this situation over.It might as well be understood here, he said,
that they were husband and wife.Vesta was to be introduced as
Jennie's daughter by her first marriage, her husband, a Mr.Stover
(her mother's maiden name), having died immediately after the child's
birth.Lester, of course, was the stepfather.This particular
neighborhood was so far from the fashionable heart of Chicago that
Lester did not expect to run into many of his friends.He explained to
Jennie the ordinary formalities of social intercourse, so that when
the first visitor called Jennie might be prepared to receive her.Within a fortnight this first visitor arrived in the person of Mrs.Jacob Stendahl, a woman of considerable importance in this particular
section.She lived five doors from Jennie--the houses of the
neighborhood were all set in spacious lawns--and drove up in her
carriage, on her return from her shopping, one afternoon.she asked of Jeannette, the new maid."I think so, mam," answered the girl."Won't you let me have your
card?"The card was given and taken to Jennie, who looked at it
curiously.When Jennie came into the parlor Mrs.Stendahl, a tall dark,
inquisitive-looking woman, greeted her most cordially."I thought I would take the liberty of intruding on you," she said
most winningly.I live on the other side
of the street, some few doors up.Perhaps you have seen the
house--the one with the white stone gate-posts.""Oh, yes indeed," replied Jennie.Kane and I
were admiring it the first day we came out here.""I know of your husband, of course, by reputation.My husband is
connected with the Wilkes Frog and Switch Company."She knew that the latter concern must be
something important and profitable from the way in which Mrs."We have lived here quite a number of years, and I know how you
must feel coming as a total stranger to a new section of the city.I
hope you will find time to come in and see me some afternoon."Indeed I shall," answered Jennie, a little nervously, for the
ordeal was a trying one.Kane is very busy as a rule, but when he is at home I am sure he would
be most pleased to meet you and your husband.""You must both come over some evening," replied Mrs.Jennie smiled her assurances of good-will.Stendahl to the door, and shook hands with her."I'm so glad to find
you so charming," observed Mrs."Oh, thank you," said Jennie flushing a little."I'm sure I don't
deserve so much praise.""Well, now I will expect you some afternoon.Good-by," and she
waved a gracious farewell."That wasn't so bad," thought Jennie as she watched Mrs.Timothy Ballinger--all of whom left
cards, or stayed to chat a few minutes.Jennie found herself taken
quite seriously as a woman of importance, and she did her best to
support the dignity of her position.And, indeed, she did
exceptionally well.She had a
kindly smile and a manner wholly natural; she succeeded in making a
most favorable impression.She explained to her guests that she had
been living on the North Side until recently, that her husband,
Mr.Kane, had long wanted to have a home in Hyde Park, that her father
and daughter were living here, and that Lester was the child's
stepfather.She said she hoped to repay all these nice attentions and
to be a good neighbor.Lester heard about these calls in the evening, for he did not care
to meet these people.Jennie came to enjoy it in a mild way.She liked
making new friends, and she was hoping that something definite could
be worked out here which would make Lester look upon her as a good
wife and an ideal companion.Perhaps, some day, he might really want
to marry her.First impressions are not always permanent, as Jennie was soon to
discover.The neighborhood had accepted her perhaps a little too
hastily, and now rumors began to fly about.Sommerville,
calling on Mrs.Craig, one of Jennie's near neighbors, intimated that
she knew who Lester was--"oh, yes, indeed.You know, my dear,"
she went on, "his reputation is just a little--" she raised her
eyebrows and her hand at the same time."He looks like
such a staid, conservative person.""Oh, no doubt, in a way, he is," went on Mrs."His
family is of the very best.There was some young woman he went
with--so my husband tells me.I don't know whether this is the
one or not, but she was introduced as a Miss Gorwood, or some such
name as that, when they were living together as husband and wife on
the North Side."Craig with her tongue at this
astonishing news.Come to think of it, it must be
the same woman.It
seems to me that there was some earlier scandal in connection with
her--at least there was a child.Whether he married her afterward
or not, I don't know.Anyhow, I understand his family will not have
anything to do with her.""And to think he
should have married her afterward, if he really did.I'm sure you
can't tell with whom you're coming in contact these days, can
you?""Well, it may be," went on her guest, "that this isn't the same
woman after all.She told me they had been living
on the North Side.""Then I'm sure it's the same person.How curious that you should
speak of her!""It is, indeed," went on Mrs.Craig, who was speculating as to what
her attitude toward Jennie should be in the future.There were people who had
seen Jennie and Lester out driving on the North Side, who had been
introduced to her as Miss Gerhardt, who knew what the Kane family
thought.Of course her present position, the handsome house, the
wealth of Lester, the beauty of Vesta--all these things helped to
soften the situation.She was apparently too circumspect, too much the
good wife and mother, too really nice to be angry with; but she had a
past, and that had to be taken into consideration.An opening bolt of the coming storm fell upon Jennie one day when
Vesta, returning from school, suddenly asked: "Mamma, who was my
papa?""His name was Stover, dear," replied her mother, struck at once by
the thought that there might have been some criticism--that some
one must have been saying something.continued Vesta, ignoring the last inquiry, and
interested in clearing up her own identity."Anita Ballinger said I didn't have any papa, and that you weren't
ever married when you had me.She said I wasn't a really, truly girl
at all--just a nobody.Ballinger had called, and Jennie had thought her peculiarly gracious
and helpful in her offer of assistance, and now her little daughter
had said this to Vesta."You mustn't pay any attention to her, dearie," said Jennie at
last.Stover, and you were born
in Columbus.Of course they say
nasty things when they fight--sometimes things they don't really
mean.Just let her alone and don't go near her any more.Then she
won't say anything to you."It was a lame explanation, but it satisfied Vesta for the time
being."I'll slap her if she tries to slap me," she persisted."You mustn't go near her, pet, do you hear?Then she can't try to
slap you," returned her mother."Just go about your studies, and don't
mind her.She can't quarrel with you if you don't let her."Vesta went away leaving Jennie brooding over her words.It is one thing to nurse a single thrust, another to have the wound
opened from time to time by additional stabs.One day Jennie, having
gone to call on Mrs.Hanson Field, who was her immediate neighbor, met
a Mrs.Williston Baker, who was there taking tea.Baker knew of
the Kanes, of Jennie's history on the North Side, and of the attitude
of the Kane family.She was a thin, vigorous, intellectual woman,
somewhat on the order of Mrs.Bracebridge, and very careful of her
social connections.Field a woman of
the same rigid circumspectness of attitude, and when she found Jennie
calling there she was outwardly calm but inwardly irritated.Field, introducing her guests with a
smiling countenance."Indeed," she went on freezingly."I've heard a great deal about
Mrs.--" accenting the word "Mrs.--Lester Kane."Field, ignoring Jennie completely, and started
an intimate conversation in which Jennie could have no possible share.Jennie stood helplessly by, unable to formulate a thought which would
be suitable to so trying a situation.Baker soon announced her
departure, although she had intended to stay longer."I can't remain
another minute," she said; "I promised Mrs.Neil that I would stop in
to see her to-day.I'm sure I've bored you enough already as it
is."She walked to the door, not troubling to look at Jennie until she
was nearly out of the room.Then she looked in her direction, and gave
her a frigid nod."We meet such curious people now and again," she observed finally
to her hostess as she swept away.Field did not feel able to defend Jennie, for she herself was
in no notable social position, and was endeavoring, like every other
middle-class woman of means, to get along.Williston Baker, who was socially so much more important than
Jennie.She came back to where Jennie was sitting, smiling
apologetically, but she was a little bit flustered.Jennie was out of
countenance, of course.Presently she excused herself and went home.She had been cut deeply by the slight offered her, and she felt that
Mrs.Field realized that she had made a mistake in ever taking her up.There would be no additional exchange of visits there--that she
knew.The old hopeless feeling came over her that her life was a
failure.It couldn't be made right, or, if it could, it wouldn't be.Lester was not inclined to marry her and put her right.Time went on and matters remained very much as they were.To look
at this large house, with its smooth lawn and well grown trees, its
vines clambering about the pillars of the veranda and interlacing
themselves into a transparent veil of green; to see Gerhardt pottering
about the yard, Vesta coming home from school, Lester leaving in the
morning in his smart trap--one would have said that here is peace
and plenty, no shadow of unhappiness hangs over this charming
home.And as a matter of fact existence with Lester and Jennie did run
smoothly.It is true that the neighbors did not call any more, or only
a very few of them, and there was no social life to speak of; but the
deprivation was hardly noticed; there was so much in the home life to
please and interest.Vesta was learning to play the piano, and to play
quite well.Jennie was a charming figure
in blue, lavender, and olive-green house-gowns as she went about her
affairs, sewing, dusting, getting Vesta off to school, and seeing that
things generally were put to rights.Gerhardt busied himself about his
multitudinous duties, for he was not satisfied unless he had his hands
into all the domestic economies of the household.One of his
self-imposed tasks was to go about the house after Lester, or the
servants, turning out the gas-jets or electric-light bulbs which might
accidentally have been left burning.Again, Lester's expensive clothes, which he carelessly threw aside
after a few month's use, were a source of woe to the thrifty old
German.Moreover, he grieved over splendid shoes discarded because of
a few wrinkles in the leather or a slightly run down heel or sole.Gerhardt was for having them repaired, but Lester answered the old
man's querulous inquiry as to what was wrong "with them shoes" by
saying that they weren't comfortable any more.No
good can come of anything like that, It will mean want one of these
days.""He can't help it, papa," Jennie excused."That's the way he was
raised."These Americans, they know nothing of
economy.Then they would know
what a dollar can do."Lester heard something of this through Jennie, but he only smiled.Another grievance was Lester's extravagant use of matches.He had
the habit of striking a match, holding it while he talked, instead of
lighting his cigar, and then throwing it away.Sometimes he would
begin to light a cigar two or three minutes before he would actually
do so, tossing aside match after match.There was a place out in one
corner of the veranda where he liked to sit of a spring or summer
evening, smoking and throwing away half-burned matches.Jennie would
sit with him, and a vast number of matches would be lit and flung out
on the lawn.At one time, while engaged in cutting the grass, Gerhardt
found, to his horror, not a handful, but literally boxes of
half-burned match-sticks lying unconsumed and decaying under the
fallen blades.He gathered up
this damning evidence in a newspaper and carried it back into the
sitting-room where Jennie was sewing.That man,
he has no more sense of economy than a--than a--" the right
term failed him."He sits and smokes, and this is the way he uses
matches.Five cents a box they cost--five cents.How can a man
hope to do well and carry on like that, I like to know."Lester is extravagant," she
said.At least they should be
burned in the furnace.He would have used them as lighters for his own
pipe, sticking them in the fire to catch a blaze, only old newspapers
were better, and he had stacks of these--another evidence of his
lord and master's wretched, spendthrift disposition.It was a sad
world to work in.Still he fought
as valiantly as he could against waste and shameless extravagance.He would wear the same suit of
black--cut down from one of Lester's expensive investments of
years before--every Sunday for a couple of years.Lester's shoes,
by a little stretch of the imagination, could be made to seem to fit,
and these he wore.His old ties also--the black ones--they
were fine.If he could have cut down Lester's shirts he would have
done so; he did make over the underwear, with the friendly aid of the
cook's needle.Lester's socks, of course, were just right.There was
never any expense for Gerhardt's clothing.The remaining stock of Lester's discarded clothing--shoes,
shirts, collars, suits, ties, and what not--he would store away
for weeks and months, and then, in a sad and gloomy frame of mind, he
would call in a tailor, or an old-shoe man, or a ragman, and dispose
of the lot at the best price he could.He learned that all second-hand
clothes men were sharks; that there was no use in putting the least
faith in the protests of any rag dealer or old-shoe man.They all claimed to be very poor, when as a matter of fact they
were actually rolling in wealth.Gerhardt had investigated these
stories; he had followed them up; he had seen what they were doing
with the things he sold them."They offer me ten cents for a pair of
shoes, and then I see them hanging out in front of their places marked
two dollars.They could afford to give me a
dollar."It was only to her that he complained, for he could
expect no sympathy from' Lester.So far as his own meager store of
money was concerned, he gave the most of it to his beloved church,
where he was considered to be a model of propriety, honesty,
faith--in fact, the embodiment of all the virtues.And so, for all the ill winds that were beginning to blow socially,
Jennie was now leading the dream years of her existence.Lester, in
spite of the doubts which assailed him at times as to the wisdom of
his career, was invariably kind and considerate, and he seemed to
enjoy his home life.she would ask when he came in of an
evening.he would answer, and pinch her chin or cheek.She would follow him in while Jeannette, always alert, would take
his coat and hat.In the winter-time they would sit in the library
before the big grate-fire.In the spring, summer, or fall Lester
preferred to walk out on the porch, one corner of which commanded a
sweeping view of the lawn and the distant street, and light his
before-dinner cigar.Jennie would sit on the side of his chair and
stroke his head."Your hair is not getting the least bit thin, Lester;
aren't you glad?"she would say; or, "Oh, see how your brow is
wrinkled now.You didn't change your tie, mister,
this morning."Oh, I forgot," he would answer, or he would cause the wrinkles to
disappear, or laughingly predict that he would soon be getting bald if
he wasn't so now.In the drawing-room or library, before Vesta and Gerhardt, she was
not less loving, though a little more circumspect.She loved odd
puzzles like pigs in clover, the spider's hole, baby billiards, and
the like.He would work by
the hour, if necessary, to make a difficult puzzle come right.Jennie
was clever at solving these mechanical problems.Sometimes she would
have to show him the right method, and then she would be immensely
pleased with herself.At other times she would stand behind him
watching, her chin on his shoulder, her arms about his neck.He seemed
not to mind--indeed, he was happy in the wealth of affection she
bestowed.Her cleverness, her gentleness, her tact created an
atmosphere which was immensely pleasing; above all her youth and
beauty appealed to him.It made him feel young, and if there was one
thing Lester objected to, it was the thought of drying up into an
aimless old age."I want to keep young, or die young," was one of his
pet remarks; and Jennie came to understand.She was glad that she was
so much younger now for his sake.Another pleasant feature of the home life was Lester's steadily
increasing affection for Vesta.The child would sit at the big table
in the library in the evening conning her books, while Jennie would
sew, and Gerhardt would read his interminable list of German Lutheran
papers.It grieved the old man that Vesta should not be allowed to go
to a German Lutheran parochial school, but Lester would listen to
nothing of the sort."We'll not have any thick-headed German training
in this," he said to Jennie, when she suggested that Gerhardt had
complained."The public schools are good enough for any child.There were really some delightful hours among the four.Lester
liked to take the little seven-year-old school-girl between his knees
and tease her.He liked to invert the so-called facts of life, to
propound its paradoxes, and watch how the child's budding mind took
them.he would ask; and being informed that it was
"what we drink," he would stare and say, "That's so, but what is it?Don't they teach you any better than that?""Well, it is what we drink, isn't it?""The fact that we drink it doesn't explain what it is," he would
retort."You ask your teacher what water is"; and then he would leave
her with this irritating problem troubling her young soul.Food, china, her dress, anything was apt to be brought back to its
chemical constituents, and he would leave her to struggle with these
dark suggestions of something else back of the superficial appearance
of things until she was actually in awe of him.She had a way of
showing him how nice she looked before she started to school in the
morning, a habit that arose because of his constant criticism of her
appearance.He wanted her to look smart, he insisted on a big bow of
blue ribbon for her hair, he demanded that her shoes be changed from
low quarter to high boots with the changing character of the seasons'
and that her clothing be carried out on a color scheme suited to her
complexion and disposition."That child's light and gay by disposition.Don't put anything
somber on her," he once remarked.Jennie had come to realize that he must be consulted in this, and
would say, "Run to your papa and show him how you look."Vesta would come and turn briskly around before him, saying,
"See."He grew so proud of her that on Sundays and some week-days when
they drove he would always have her in between them.He insisted that
Jennie send her to dancing-school, and Gerhardt was beside himself
with rage and grief."Such
devil's fol-de-rol.To make a no-good
out of her--a creature to be ashamed of?""Oh no, papa," replied Jennie.A fine lot he knows about what is good
for a child.A card-player, a whisky-drinker!""Now, hush, papa; I won't have you talk like that," Jennie would
reply warmly."He's a good man, and you know it."When Lester was near he said nothing, and
Vesta could wind him around her finger."Oh you," she would say, pulling at his arm or rubbing his grizzled
cheek.There was no more fight in Gerhardt when Vesta did this.He
lost control of himself--something welled up and choked his
throat."Yes, I know how you do," he would exclaim.It was noticeable, however, that she did not have to stop unless
she herself willed it.Gerhardt adored the child, and she could do
anything with him; he was always her devoted servitor.CHAPTER XXXIX


During this period the dissatisfaction of the Kane family with
Lester's irregular habit of life grew steadily stronger.That it could
not help but become an open scandal, in the course of time, was
sufficiently obvious to them.People
seemed to understand in a wise way, though nothing was ever said
directly.Kane senior could scarcely imagine what possessed his son to
fly in the face of conventions in this manner.If the woman had been
some one of distinction--some sorceress of the stage, or of the
world of art, or letters, his action would have been explicable if not
commendable, but with this creature of very ordinary capabilities, as
Louise had described her, this putty-faced nobody--he could not
possibly understand it.Lester was his son, his favorite son; it was too bad that he had
not settled down in the ordinary way.Look at the women in Cincinnati
who knew him and liked him.Why in the
name of common sense had he not married her?She was good looking,
sympathetic, talented.The old man grieved bitterly, and then, by
degrees, he began to harden.It seemed a shame that Lester should
treat him so.It wasn't natural, or justifiable, or decent.Archibald
Kane brooded over it until he felt that some change ought to be
enforced, but just what it should be he could not say.Lester was his
own boss, and he would resent any criticism of his actions.Certain changes helped along an approaching denouement.Louise
married not many months after her very disturbing visit to Chicago,
and then the home property was fairly empty except for visiting
grandchildren.Lester did not attend the wedding, though he was
invited.Kane died, making a readjustment of
the family will necessary.Lester came home on this occasion, grieved
to think he had lately seen so little of his mother--that he had
caused her so much pain--but he had no explanation to make.His
father thought at the time of talking to him, but put it off because
of his obvious gloom.He went back to Chicago, and there were more
months of silence.Kane's death and Louise's marriage, the father went to
live with Robert, for his three grandchildren afforded him his
greatest pleasure in his old age.The business, except for the final
adjustment which would come after his death, was in Robert's hands.The latter was consistently agreeable to his sisters and their
husbands and to his father, in view of the eventual control he hoped
to obtain.He was not a sycophant in any sense of the word, but a
shrewd, cold business man, far shrewder than his brother gave him
credit for.He was already richer than any two of the other children
put together, but he chose to keep his counsel and to pretend modesty
of fortune.He realized the danger of envy, and preferred a Spartan
form of existence, putting all the emphasis on inconspicuous but very
ready and very hard cash.While Lester was drifting Robert was
working--working all the time.Robert's scheme for eliminating his brother from participation in
the control of the business was really not very essential, for his
father, after long brooding over the details of the Chicago situation,
had come to the definite conclusion that any large share of his
property ought not to go to Lester.Obviously, Lester was not so
strong a man as he had thought him to be.Of the two brothers, Lester
might be the bigger intellectually or
sympathetically--artistically and socially there was no
comparison--but Robert got commercial results in a silent,
effective way.If Lester was not going to pull himself together at
this stage of the game, when would he?Better leave his property to
those who would take care of it.Archibald Kane thought seriously of
having his lawyer revise his will in such a way that, unless Lester
should reform, he would be cut off with only a nominal income.But he
decided to give Lester one more chance--to make a plea, in fact,
that he should abandon his false way of living, and put himself on a
sound basis before the world.Old
Archibald wrote Lester that he would like to have a talk with him at
his convenience, and within the lapse of thirty-six hours Lester was
in Cincinnati."I thought I'd have one more talk with you, Lester, on a subject
that's rather difficult for me to bring up," began the elder Kane."Yes, I know," replied Lester, calmly."I used to think, when I was much younger that my son's matrimonial
ventures would never concern me, but I changed my views on that score
when I got a little farther along.I began to see through my business
connections how much the right sort of a marriage helps a man, and
then I got rather anxious that my boys should marry well.I used to
worry about you, Lester, and I'm worrying yet.This recent connection
you've made has caused me no end of trouble.It worried your mother up
to the very last.Don't you think you
have gone far enough with it?What
it is in Chicago I don't know, but it can't be a secret.That can't
help the house in business there.The
whole thing has gone on so long that you have injured your prospects
all around, and yet you continue."I suppose because I love her," Lester replied."You can't be serious in that," said his father."If you had loved
her, you'd have married her in the first place.Surely you wouldn't
take a woman and live with her as you have with this woman for years,
disgracing her and yourself, and still claim that you love her.You
may have a passion for her, but it isn't love.""How do you know I haven't married her?"He
wanted to see how his father would take to that idea.The old gentleman propped himself up on his
arms and looked at him."No, I'm not," replied Lester, "but I might be.I can't believe a man of your intelligence would do a thing like that,
Lester.Why, you've lived in open adultery
with her for years, and now you talk of marrying her.Why, in heaven's
name, if you were going to do anything like that, didn't you do it in
the first place?Disgrace your parents, break your mother's heart,
injure the business, become a public scandal, and then marry the cause
of it?"Don't get excited, father," said Lester quickly."We won't get
anywhere that way.She's not a bad woman, and
I wish you wouldn't talk about her as you do."I know enough," insisted old Archibald, determinedly."I know that
no good woman would act as she has done.Why, man, she's after your
money.It's as plain as the nose on your
face.""Father," said Lester, his voice lowering ominously, "why do you
talk like that?You wouldn't know her from
Adam's off ox.Louise comes down here and gives an excited report, and
you people swallow it whole.She isn't as bad as you think she is, and
I wouldn't use the language you're using about her if I were you.You're doing a good woman an injustice, and you won't, for some
reason, be fair."Is it
fair to me, to your family, to your dead mother to take a woman of the
streets and live with her?Is it--"

"Stop now, father," exclaimed Lester, putting up his hand.You're talking about the woman
that I'm living with--that I may marry.I love you, but I won't
have you saying things that aren't so.She isn't a woman of the
streets.You know, as well as you know anything, that I wouldn't take
up with a woman of that kind.We'll have to discuss this in a calmer
mood, or I won't stay here.But I won't
listen to any such language as that."In spite of his opposition, he
respected his son's point of view.He sat back in his chair and stared
at the floor."No, we've moved out to Hyde Park."Well, that's a God's blessing.""I didn't say that," replied his son.exclaimed his father, his anger bubbling again.How do you
suppose I can seriously contemplate entrusting any share of my fortune
to a man who has so little regard for what the world considers as
right and proper?Why, Lester, this carriage business, your family,
your personal reputation appear to be as nothing at all to you.I
can't understand what has happened to your pride.It seems like some
wild, impossible fancy.""It's pretty hard to explain, father, and I can't do it very well.I simply know that I'm in this affair, and that I'm bound to see it
through.I'm not prepared now to say what I'll do.Old Archibald merely shook his head disapprovingly."You've made a bad mess of this, Lester," he said finally.But I suppose you are determined to go your way.Nothing
that I have said appears to move you.""Well, I warn you, then, that, unless you show some consideration
for the dignity of your family and the honor of your position it will
make a difference in my will.I can't go on countenancing this thing,
and not be a party to it morally and every other way.You can leave her, or you can marry her.You certainly ought to do one
or the other.If you leave her, everything will be all right.You can
make any provision for her you like.I'll
gladly pay whatever you agree to.You will share with the rest of the
children, just as I had planned.If you marry her it will make a
difference.I'm doing what I think is my bounden duty.Now you think
that over and let me know."He felt that
his father probably meant what he said, but how could he leave Jennie,
and justify himself to himself?The old gentleman loved him even now--he could see
it.Lester felt troubled and distressed; this attempt at coercion
irritated him.The idea--he, Lester Kane, being made to do such a
thing to throw Jennie down.Old Archibald saw that he had let fly a telling bullet."Well," said Lester finally, "there's no use of our discussing it
any further now--that's certain, isn't it?I can't say what I'll
do.Lester was sorry for the world's
attitude and for his father's keen feeling about the affair.Kane
senior was sorry for his son, but he was determined to see the thing
through.He wasn't sure whether he had converted Lester or not, but he
was hopeful."Good-by, father," said Lester, holding out his hand."I think I'll
try and make that two-ten train.There isn't anything else you wanted
to see me about?"The old man sat there after Lester had gone, thinking deeply.What a foolhardy
persistence in evil and error!He
was the one to control a business.It was a long time
before he stirred.And still, in the bottom of his heart, his erring
son continued to appeal to him.CHAPTER XL


Lester returned to Chicago.He realized that he had offended his
father seriously, how seriously he could not say.In all his personal
relations with old Archibald he had never seen him so worked up.But
even now Lester did not feel that the breach was irreparable; he
hardly realized that it was necessary for him to act decisively if he
hoped to retain his father's affection and confidence.As for the
world at large, what did it matter how much people talked or what they
said.People turn so
quickly from weakness or the shadow of it.To get away from
failure--even the mere suspicion of it--that seems to be a
subconscious feeling with the average man and woman; we all avoid
non-success as though we fear that it may prove contagious.Lester was
soon to feel the force of this prejudice.One day Lester happened to run across Berry Dodge, the millionaire
head of Dodge, Holbrook & Kingsbury, a firm that stood in the
dry-goods world, where the Kane Company stood in the carriage world.Dodge had been one of Lester's best friends.He knew him as intimately
as he knew Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, and George Knowles, of
Cincinnati
